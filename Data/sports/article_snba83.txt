Standing erect, he exhales deeply as his empty right hand falls politely to his side. Like a chubby-cheeked choirboy lifting an open hymnal, he raises the black Wilson mitt on his left hand to a resting place in front of his solemn game face. After a gentle rock backward, he reaches into his glove, as if to remove a bookmark, grasps the ball and, with a grimace and a grunt, commences the same windup that he had rehearsed before a full-length mirror after every Little League game. Clemens is a 6-foot-4-inch time machine, a throwback to an era when uniforms were baggy and throwing hard was everything, when the guy hurtling thunderbolts down from the mound was Cy Young or Walter Johnson or Bob Feller. His high hard ones rip across the ages, punching holes in fancy hitting theories and computerized strategies. In 1986, he struck out 20 batters in a single game, a major-league record. Grab a bat and feel the heat. Crowd the plate and he'll brush you back easy as spit. If the opposing pitcher plunks one of his mates, Clemens'll nail the next batter he faces. He even has a good old-fashioned monicker: the Rocket. In the first inning on this crisp New England afternoon, three Indians come up, three Indians sit down. No ball leaves the infield. It will be a long and frustrating day for the batters from Cleveland, a club with two rookie starters who have never faced a pitcher of this caliber. The 28-year-old Clemens is off to a dazzling start this season, already racking up six victories and 30 consecutive scoreless innings, striking out five times as many hitters as he walks. At this rate, by season's end he will have compiled 25 victories, struck out 200-plus batters for the sixth time, posted an earned run average in the neighborhood of 2.00.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Springtime, when pitchers are perennially ahead of hitters, always produces a few fast starters, but when the weather heats up, bats do likewise. Timing improves, pitchers' patterns are revealed. None of this applies to Clemens. He does not have slumps; barring injuries, he has only good stretches and dominating stretches. Last season, from early August until early September, he went 8-0 with an 0.80 e.r.a.: in 67 innings, he gave up six runs and six walks, registering 65 strikeouts.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Six Indians up, six Indians down. Already, Fenway Park is abuzz with talk of a no-hitter. It would be Clemens's first. In Section 21, the seats behind home plate, a kid, all of 10, in a tattered Red Sox cap with a red B, turns to his father and says, with all the wisdom of youth: "It's no fair, Dad, he throws too hard. They can't hit him." IT'S THAT SIMPLE AND THAT COMPLICATED. When Clemens throws his 97-m.p.h. fastball, a batter has 38/100 of a second to find it and hit it. Batters have nowhere to practice such an act. Most major-league fastballs are in the range of 85 m.p.h. As if the super-octane gas weren't potent enough, Clemens pumps four different high grades. He will move a right-handed hitter away from the plate with a couple of fastballs that rush toward him, then deliver one that tails away, low and unreachable. When he holds the ball with his index and middle fingers across the seams, an underspin is produced that causes the ball to rise. (Physicists argue that this is a gravitational impossibility. Batters know only that it's a tough pitch to hit.) When Clemens grips the ball along the red stitching, the ball becomes "heavy" and sinks as it approaches the plate. After he makes the hitter "climb the ladder," sending successive pitches higher in the strike zone, the "seamer" comes as a complete surprise. The rare hitter who manages to time the hard stuff may see the "89 slider," a pitch that veers away from a righty at a slightly slower pace. Or the old reliable curve, humpbacked and unexpected. And finally, Clemens has perfected a new pitch this season, the forkball, a nasty number that drops out of the strike zone entirely, but not before looking suspiciously like a fastball. Baseball has a few pitchers who can match Clemens's speed, but none with his accuracy. Indeed, only a handful of pitchers in the history of the game have been able to throw the variety of pitches Clemens possesses with his pinpoint control. "You can't watch for the fastball any more," reports Joe Carter, the Toronto Blue Jay slugger who has returned to the American League after a season in the National League. "I had to update my file on Roger -- everything he throws now can be a strike." Control has always been Clemens's forte. In high school, where wildness is the norm, he walked only 24 batters while striking out 112 in 108 innings. In his two years at the University of Texas, there were 56 bases on balls and 241 whiffs in 275 innings. With conditioning and confidence, the power has increased over the years but the control has remained the same: last season, in 228 innings, he fanned 209 and walked 54.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   "I could always throw strikes in the dark," says Clemens with his Texas twang. "It's a God-given thing." Clemens has hit a silver dollar from 60 feet, 6 inches. During a game, 9 out of 10 pitches go exactly where he means them to go. His catcher, Tony Pena, says he simply sets up a target and waits for the thump. If the ball does not hit the padded pocket of his mitt just so, Pena's hand is numb for three innings. TWELVE INDIANS UP, 12 INDIANS DOWN. Cleveland is having no luck with the cross-seamer. Last week, against the fastball-hitting Toronto Blue Jays, nearly half of Clemens's pitches were forkballs, sliders and curves. Today, he picks up the speed. If anyone thought Clemens's concentration would be corrupted by his newly minted contract or the fallout from his explosion in last season's American League playoffs, they don't know him. He is inspired by tumult; he loves to disappoint his detractors. And there are plenty of them. After carrying the Red Sox to a division title last fall, Clemens became unhinged during Boston's disastrous playoff loss to Oakland. He got into a series of verbal, even violent, imbroglios with a Boston photographer, sundry Oakland A's, umpires, his own manager and an innocent, if unyielding, clubhouse door, which he smashed with his pitching hand on the eve of the American League Championship. Ejected from the final game of the series for cursing, he ran through one umpire in order to threaten another with off-season retaliation. The Rocket had exploded. Indelible remains the memory of that lip-readable frenzy that caused one of the Red Sox owners, John Harrington -- not to mention millions of startled fans -- to question the mental stability of the star hurler. Then, only three months later, Clemens was arrested for aggravated assault on a policeman. The officer had been in the process of arresting his older brother Randy Clemens for causing a disturbance in a crowded Houston saloon called Bayou Mama's Swamp Bar. The brawl was front-page news in Boston: Good Ol' Boy in Bad New Scrap. How did the conservative Red Sox organization react to all the controversy? By awarding Clemens a four-year contract, averaging $5.3 million per season, making him the highest-paid player in baseball history (basketball and football history, too). Befuddled fans, especially in recession-plagued New England, questioned the mental stability of Red Sox management. THE WAY CLEMENS IS pitching today, it's easy to forgive his transgressions. After all, what's a freakout and a felony and five million bucks compared with the promise of a pennant? In the bottom of the third inning, the Red Sox had scored their first run on two Cleveland errors. Clemens watches Pena cross the plate on the monitor in the clubhouse, where he has gone to change into a fresh jersey and to confer with Bill Fischer, his pitching coach since his second season.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   "No one knows how  [ expletive ]  hard this guy works," Fischer, a grizzled ex-marine, says later. "Every  [ expletive ]  day, he works on his fastball, slider, curve, forkball, his mechanics, his pick-off move. He runs and he studies and he's  [ expletive ]  obsessed with being a great pitcher." Fischer pitched for five teams during a nine-year major-league career distinguished by one record: 84 1/3 consecutive innings without a walk. You take a man who has spent his entire adult life around leathernecks and ballplayers and you are hard-pressed to hear an expletive-free sentence. "There's something the public doesn't understand about pitchers -- they're freaks. Roger Clemens is a  [ expletive ]  freak. Every great pitcher I ever known is a  [ expletive ]  freak. Any time you can throw a ball 90-plus m.p.h. over the plate whenever you want, you're a  [ expletive ]  freak of nature. There was Gibson and Palmer and Seaver and Ryan, and now there's Roger Clemens. He's the big bully on the block. He says he's the best, and he backs it up. That kills people. His only problem is that he works too  [ expletive ]  hard, and he overpitches sometimes. That's my job -- some guys you gotta calm down, some guys you gotta kick." The pitching coach has his work cut out for him this year. After Clemens, the Red Sox staff is a collection of kids, castoffs and free agents acquired by the front office during a winter of irrepressible largess. Matt Young has a three-year contract that will give him $6.35 million. He has never won more than 12 games in one season in the majors. Danny Darwin signed for four years and $11.8 million. Darwin, 35, has never won more than nine games in a single year as a starter. Over all, the Red Sox agreed to pay six players a total of $66.2 million for 20 years, an average of $3.3 million a year. In this great baseball bazaar, Roger Clemens may turn out to be one high-priced bargain. "The marketplace is crazy," says the Red Sox's affable general manager, Lou Gorman. "The Red Sox payroll seven years ago was $6.7 million. The payroll this year is $34 million. You have no choice. I believe that if the escalation of salaries continues, there are going to be some clubs in bankruptcy." The Red Sox are not one of those teams. Despite the fourth-highest payroll in baseball, there is little fear of red ink. Local television will bring in about $25 million a year until 1995. Fenway Park sells itself. The fans are crazy loyal. Of course, the biggest news of the signing binge was Clemens's $5,380,250 per season. Based on last year's stats, this will break down to $256,202 per victory, $25,742 per strikeout. The numbers addle the brain until one considers that Ted Danson, the star of the long-running television hit "Cheers," earns comparable money per laugh and pickup line. And he only pretends he pitched for the Red Sox. "If Clemens walked away, I believe the fans of New England would have hanged me from the centerfield flagpole," says Gorman, quickly adding, "in effigy. We had no choice. Leverage controls any negotiation. Clemens had total leverage. Look, we couldn't afford not to sign Clemens. We made the best deal we could, although no one would agree. Personally, I think we got off easy."   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Before the signing, Clemens's arm was inspected by three specialists. Nobody probed his psyche. Gorman doesn't put much stock in that psychiatry stuff. "I never thought about Roger seeing anyone," the general manager says. "He's just a very intense competitor who blew up last year. Off the field, his personal habits are good. He's a good family man. He never has more than one beer. He's a health nut. If I worry about anything, I worry about him running around the streets of Boston and getting hit by a car." If not for $5,000, Clemens might be running through the mean streets of Manhattan. When he was a 19-year-old prospect at San Jacinto Junior College, the Mets tried to sign him. They drafted him in the 12th round and sent two officials to Texas to recruit him. The pair trapped him in a parking lot after a game and offered him $30,000. Roger wanted $5,000 more. The vice president of the Mets nixed the deal. His name was Lou Gorman. Ten years and several zeroes later, he didn't let it happen again. IN THE FIFTH INNING, AS the 14th straight Indian is retired, the no-hitter talk takes on new earnestness. A number of fans invoke the name of Nolan Ryan, the 44-year-old Texas Ranger who will pitch his seventh no-hitter a couple of weeks later. As a teen-ager, Roger Clemens walked around with a photograph of Nolan Ryan in mid-pitch. He studied the still, intuiting that flawless mechanics were the key to both dominion and longevity on the mound. As a 10th grader, after his family had moved to Houston from Dayton, Ohio, he'd sneak off to the Astrodome to watch his local hero, then pitching for the Astros. When Ryan faced Tom Seaver, it was a masters' class in Advanced Power Pitching. Clemens's style is now a hybrid of those two classicists. Never more than acquaintances, Clemens and Ryan are separated by a generation, conflicting schedules and the 40 miles between two small Texas towns -- Clemens's Katy and Ryan's Alvin. Clemens jokes that if Ryan would only act his age, there might be a line or two in the record book left for him. With two outs in the fifth inning, dreams of a no-no bounce up the middle, just beyond the reach of rookie shortstop Tim Naehring. Clemens hastily mops his brow with the tip of his glove, then glowers at the runner on first. According to John Marzano, the Red Sox's backup catcher and Clemens's best buddy on the team, the pitcher gets indignant when a runner reaches first; if said runner should find his way safely to second, Clemens gets downright livid. For Clemens, pitching is an angry meditation. Every hitter is an enemy, every game a mission. So fierce is his intensity that it irks fellow professionals. Willie Wilson, of the Oakland A's, once complained: "Who does he think he is? He struts around out there like 'Hey, man, I'm God. I'm Roger God Clemens, and nobody's going to hit me.'

"I don't jog -- I run!" he proclaims. In the off-season, he ties tires to a harness and pulls them across the parking lot of his alma mater, Spring Woods High School in Houston. During the season, no matter the city in which he awakes, Clemens runs in the streets every morning, wearing a black Los Angeles Raiders cap turned backward, revealing short, spiky hair into which he has scupltured thin parallel lines.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   For half the year, he lives in a self-imposed exile from fun. No carousing, no late-night revelry. He brings this purposefulness to the mound. With athletes like Rickey Henderson or Michael Jordan, you see their exuberance, their delight in sharing their delight. Clemens keeps his pleasures to himself -- the joy is in the work and the work is solitary. Few teammates pretend to know Clemens. While they gratefully acknowledge his leadership and his accomplishments -- and are in awe of his combative nature -- few are friends. When one taped the words "Possessed Rebel" on Clemens's locker, it was both compliment and dig. The pitcher took a fancy to the image. Possessed? You bet. A rebel? In every sense -- the soul of an insurgent and family roots that stretch back to Robert E. Lee. "That's where my fire comes from," says Clemens. "I've always been doubted, and I've always responded. That's what keeps me going, keeps me focused. If someone says I can't do something, I gotta show him he's wrong." The fire is further fueled by the special burdens of performing for the Boston Red Sox. To say the Bosox are a secular religion in New England is neither blasphemy nor hyperbole. "Pope Dies -- Sox Still Alive!" was a newscast teaser in 1978. Clemens is the last best chance for the Red Sox to exorcise the demons that have denied them a world championship for three score and 12 seasons. Of this obligation, he is well aware and unafraid. In fact, he welcomes the responsibilities. He approaches the world like Atlas. "I think about it all the time," he says. "How could I forget? People tell me their grandfather's sick, and he has to see the Red Sox win before he dies. The media's always writing about the monkey on our backs for 73 years. I was there in 1986 when we lost to the Mets -- I know about the curse. These people in Boston deserve a championship. My teammates deserve it, the ones on the field and the ones who aren't here any more. There are a lot of people counting on me. Believe me, it's on my mind all the time." BILL CLEMENS WAS not a responsible man. He was selfish and abusive and gone by the time his son Roger was 5 months old. The truck driver couldn't handle the pressures of supporting a wife and five children. Bill Clemens's interest in athletics involved a bottle of beer and a television set. He would not have understood, much less approved, what would become his youngest son Roger's obsession. Roger spoke to his father only once, on the telephone, gave the old man hell, told him never to come around again. Roger was 10 years old. His stepfather had died the year before. In very different ways, Clemens lost two fathers in the first decade of his life. He was the only one of the five Clemens kids who refused to attend his father's funeral. "I never knew my blood father until he passed away," Clemens says. "I'm sure he saw me pitch in the College World Series. Friends close to the family told me he watched me on television. He didn't pass until the end of that season, and seeing me might have contributed to his passing. I know if I were in his shoes, and I saw my boy do what I did, well, it would hurt, hurt real bad."   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The finale of the 1983 College World Series was the game his natural father saw. Texas versus Alabama. In the ninth inning, protecting a one-run lead, Clemens gave up a leadoff double to Dave Magadan, currently the Mets first baseman. The Texas coach walked to the mound. "I ain't coming out," said the pitcher resolutely. "I want this one." And he got it. Celebration followed. As Clemens emerged from the pileup of Longhorns, too near an ESPN microphone, he raised his clenched fist to the heavens and shouted: "You tested me, you  [ expletive ] ! Don't test me!" These are no small games Roger Clemens is playing. "Roger was always more intense than the rest of us," recalls Mark Vennerholm, who has gone from catching the Rocket in Little League to designing rockets for Texas Instruments. "He was not an outstanding athlete, but you couldn't convince Roger of that. He was a bulldog, more motivated than anyone I've ever known. He was working on this long-term plan. And he was only 10 years old!" TO END THE SEVENTH inning, on a two-two count, Clemens suddenly drops sidearm and delivers a heater that immobilizes the hitter at the plate. His release point, on which batters time their swing, has just changed. It is a new Rocket wrinkle. A few of his teammates smile as they jog off the field. "On days when Roger pitches," says Red Sox utility man Steve Lyons, "some guys on the other team decide to rest their sore hamstrings or come down with stomachaches. Good timing, eh?" Though hard to fathom, Clemens is still improving. Over the last five years, his 100 victories and 2.71 e.r.a. are the best in the majors. His statistics last year rival those of the great seasons of the modern era. He went 21-6, with an e.r.a. of 1.93, nearly a full two runs less than the league average. All this pitching in Fenway, a hitters' haven, without benefit of great defense or stalwart bullpen. "Clemens and Lemons," a local phrase last year, may have been an unkind characterization of the pitching staff, but the Red Sox were less than a .500 team without their ace on the mound. Had he not missed a crucial span in September with a sore shoulder -- the Sox folded like napkins in his absence -- he might have won his second Most Valuable Player Award and his third Cy Young Award. Clemens went into the playoffs against the highly touted Oakland A's with a sore shoulder and fragile psyche. He was worn down by the demands of the long season, by the ghosts of failures past. On the last day of the regular season, after unsuccessfully lobbying for a longer celebration before the news media were permitted into the locker room, he threw a tantrum and punched the door with his pitching hand. Despite his pitching well in the first game against Oakland, the A's were victorious. In the second game, his ragging of both umpires and opponents got so vicious that Clemens had to be restrained by his own manager, with whom he ended up in a shouting match. (Clemens denies both the bench jockeying and discord.) Moments before he was to start in the fourth game, his team down 0-3 in the best-of-seven series, Clemens rammed his shoulder into a photographer, Jim Davis of The Boston Herald, who was leaning against the backstop screen. (Clemens contends it was a light brush.) "He went out of his way to hit me," Davis says. "I tried to think of the worst thing I could possibly say when he came back on the field. Remembering that he was 0 and 7 against Dave Stewart, when he ran by, I yelled, '0 and 8, pal! 0 and 8!' "   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Since Dave Stewart became the ace of the Oakland staff five years ago, Clemens has not beaten him, lost to him four times last season alone. There is bad blood between the two best pitchers in the American League. Stewart resents all the accolades and awards Clemens has won. Clemens resents Stewart's three trips to the World Series, not to mention his fielders, hitters and bullpen. "What makes Dave Stewart so good," he says flatly, "is that he has eight guys behind him that could be on the All-Star team. I wish the writers would give him a Cy Young Award so I wouldn't have to listen to him anymore." The hex has a hold on Clemens. When he squared off against Stewart for the fourth game of the championship series last October, he wore an unfamiliar Fu Manchu mustache and war-paint eyeblack. He was facing not only his old nemesis, but also the bitter prospect of being swept by a team whose showboating style he abhors. He was not sharp that afternoon in Oakland. His fastball was not popping, his slider was missing. After walking second baseman Willie Randolph on a close call in the second inning, Clemens stomped around the mound cursing. Home plate umpire Terry Cooney shouted at him to shut up and pitch. Clemens shouted back at Cooney: "I'm not  [ expletive ]  talkin' to you. Get back behind the  [ expletive ]  plate and call the game." The next thing Clemens knew, Cooney had ejected him -- without warning and with questionable provocation. Baseball's unwritten rule allows players to use obscenity as long as it's not directed at an umpire personally. When Clemens realized he had been tossed, he went wild. Racing across the infield grass toward home plate, where his manager was quarreling with several umpires, Clemens rushed at Cooney. Pushing umpire Jim Evans out of the way, the raging pitcher was finally restrained by teammates a few feet shy of his target. Unable to reach Cooney, he settled for terrorizing him. "I'm going to find out where you live and come after you this winter!" he yelled. Clemens was suspended for five games this season and fined $10,000. He fought the decision, appealing twice, losing twice, and ended up missing one start in late April. "I don't dispute bumping an umpire," he says now, "and I'm at fault for cursing a couple of times and threatening Cooney, but all that happened after the ejection. The ejection is the nucleus of the thing, and the umpire was falsifying all over the place. The decision was unjust." Clemens feels persecuted by umpires, forgetting that throughout last season he had unleashed many a four-lettered tirade at various men behind the mask. Back in July, umpire Jim Evans had said, "If he's constantly having trouble with umpires, maybe he should look in the mirror and ask himself if maybe he's the problem." Clemens assumes no accountability, sees no cause and effect at work. Similarly, Clemens believes the Boston news media are out to get him. Though his clippings are 99 percent positive, he remembers every negative story, as well as the byline above it. He thinks members of the press use him to sell papers and, in the process, cause him undeserved grief. And when Clemens feels bushwhacked, he strikes back. "Someone's gonna get hurt if they write about my family," he said a few years ago. "Whether it's physical or whatever, I'd take action -- severe action." Over the years, his relations with reporters have ranged from the embargo of 1989, when he refused all interviews, to this season of attempted accommodation, when he talks mostly after games in which he has pitched, and only about pitching.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   IN THE EIGHTH INNING, with a 4-0 lead, Clemens is on cruise control. Pitching with a lead makes him all the more effective; he does not have to worry about a single mistake costing him the game. The incident in which he was arrested in Houston last winter served only to corroborate Clemens's view of a world populated by hostile people. Clemens, along with his older brother Randy and two friends, had gone to Bayou Mama's after seeing an Andrew Dice Clay concert. They planned to meet some other friends at the saloon. A fracas broke out at the crowded bar, and Clemens saw his brother being arrested by an off-duty policeman who doubled as a bouncer. Clemens went to his brother's aid. He says he tapped the cop on the shoulder, introduced himself, hoping that his name would turn things around, and tried to talk the officer out of making the arrest. The officer claims Clemens grabbed him from behind and crushed him in a headlock. A group of fellow officers subdued the Clemens brothers, arrested them for aggravated assault and took them to jail. The felony offense has since been downgraded to a misdemeanor charge for hindering an arrest. A hearing has been scheduled for next month. Maintaining his innocence, Clemens will not plea-bargain. He sees the incident as a turning point in his life, when the dark side of fame and fortune was revealed to him, when the general public joined umpires and news media in turning against him. "When I walk into a place like that," he says in pained tones, "everybody knows I'm there, so somebody has a chip on his shoulder or thinks I'm a tough guy. I never thought my life was gonna change. I never thought money would come back at me because of my name. Now I got people coming at me everywhere." To protect his wife, Debbie, his two young sons and himself from the perils of superstardom, he is building a 13,000-square-foot house on a three-acre plot just outside of Houston, complete with office, pitcher's mound, track, gym, weight room and 14-seat theater. The contractor is his wife's stepfather. The family is looking for a 100-acre ranch nearby, where his mother and brother Rick can live. When the compound is complete, his off-seasons will be filled with kith and kin. Father and sons will ride horses and watch movies and play catch in the spacious backyard. "I don't know whether it's a phobia or what," he has said, "but I have a hard time dealing with a lot of people I don't know around me. Sometimes I'm with my family and the crowd gets too aggressive. If my family should get hurt by these people, then I'm either going to hurt somebody or go berserk." Clemens has the Cleveland game well in hand. He has scattered three feckless singles and walked none. His fastball is still in the upper 90's and dead on. The Red Sox are on the verge of 4-0 victory. Fenway fans are standing now, in noisy anticipation of the last out. Clemens looks in for the signal, blocks out the cheering throngs. He hears only his inner voice and the faint sparks of the plaque-maker sharpening his tools in Cooperstown.    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
