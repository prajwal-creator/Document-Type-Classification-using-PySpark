On a recent afternoon, football players ran sprints under the gaze of coaches from Stanford, Virginia, West Virginia and Duke. About 75 steps away is a two-story brick building. It houses the one DeMatha program that might top them all. And buried beneath it is some of the evidence. The DeMatha music program, founded by John Mitchell in 1970 in large part to provide a pep band for Morgan Wootten’s renowned basketball team, has won so many awards that the school has run out of room for them. In the 1990s, when construction of what is now the McCarthy Music Center began, Mitchell saw opportunity. “There was a big hole in the ground, and we thought, ‘Hmmm,’ ” Mitchell said, with humor as dry as a bassoon’s B flat. “So there are a lot of trophies buried under this building. It’s happening again. We have an attic full of trophies here. We don’t have the space to build a trophy case. It’s a great problem to have, but it is a problem.”  Photo        The program has amassed enough trophies to fill an attic.

He scooted a large box holding more into the faculty restroom. Mitchell, 65, is retiring this year — he will conduct a DeMatha concert for the last time on Thursday — and part of his legacy will be stashes of substantial spoils, to be unearthed by future band directors or archaeologists.

Sports publications take turns bestowing top rankings on DeMatha’s dominating programs. The basketball team under Wootten and, since 2002, under Mike Jones, has produced about 150 college scholarship players and more than a dozen N.B.A. players. Bill McGregor, the football coach, recently resigned after 29 years, 17 conference championships and an estimated 350 players who went to college on scholarships.

Joey Peacock, a 6-foot-3 junior who plays forward on the basketball team and first-chair alto saxophone in the wind ensemble, said: “Everybody will come up to me: ‘Oh, you made the DeMatha basketball varsity team — that’s very impressive. I know that your basketball team is basically the best thing you have.’ “I’ll say: ‘I don’t really think it is the best thing we have. I think the best thing we have is our music program.’ ” What makes DeMatha most unusual is that students like Peacock are not unusual at all. While high schools everywhere are notorious for their persistent and stereotypical social strata, with athletes often perched near the top and band members near the bottom, DeMatha has largely avoided “those separate empires within the school,” as Daniel McMahon, the principal, said.

It is just as cool to be in the band. It is coolest to do both. Mitchell started with 19 students in 1970. Now he oversees 400 students, 15 ensembles (but no marching band) and 4 other full-time faculty members. (James Roper, whom Mitchell hired in 1982, will rise to director of bands.) Mitchell estimated that 70 percent of the band members play at least one sport at DeMatha.

Hudson had decades-old memories of playing tuba — not at DeMatha — and being egged by the football team. He also remembers visiting DeMatha with his son more than a decade ago, and making small talk with a football player. “He said, ‘Oh, we have the best band,’ ” recalled Hudson, whose son, Rob, is now principal timpanist for the Chattanooga Symphony and Opera. “I was taken aback. That was wonderful.” Mylek Graham quit music as a freshman but resumed when he transferred to DeMatha for his junior year. As a senior this year, he played lacrosse and saxophone. “It was competitive; it was exciting,” said his father, Scottie Graham, a former N.F.L. running back. “There are some kids that are straight-up music beasts.”  Photo        The atrium of DeMatha's gym contains numerous championship banners. The school is nationally known for its athletics.   Credit David Hunsinger for The New York Times    In 1970, DeMatha was already known for its basketball program. Five years earlier, Wootten’s team ended a 71-game winning streak by New York’s Power Memorial, led by Lew Alcindor. DeMatha teams later featured stars like Adrian Dantley, Kenny Carr, Dereck Whittenburg, Sidney Lowe, Danny Ferry and the current Chicago Bulls guard Keith Bogans.

In 1970, he was playing trombone and euphonium in the United States Army Band in Washington. He was enrolled at the University of Maryland in nearby College Park, on his way to bachelor’s and master’s degrees in music. DeMatha’s principal, John Moylan, called the university’s music department searching for someone to start a band program. “One of the first missions was to start a pep band,” Mitchell said. His first band made its debut at a basketball game, playing the national anthem and performing at halftime. “We had a stage at that time, and we opened the curtains on the stage and we played some very simple tunes for the audience, which sort of looked at us and didn’t know what was going on very much,” Mitchell said. “But that was the start of what we have now.”  Video   A Band Program Apart    A high school where there are no band geeks? At DeMatha Catholic High School, many athletes also play music in the school's many competitive ensembles.  By Sean Patrick Farrell on Publish Date May 9, 2011.  .  Watch in Times Video »         embed            By the end of the decade, the basketball team and the band, often sharing players, dominated competition. Mitchell began taking ensembles to several adjudicated festivals in 1975. The wind ensemble — think of it as a 42-member varsity team — never received less than a superior rating. The organization now known as the National Catholic Band Association named DeMatha the outstanding high school band in the country 18 times in 20 years, until the band association gently asked the school to stop applying for the honor about a decade ago, Mitchell said. The building the band occupies underwent a $1.2 million renovation a couple of years ago, making DeMatha’s facilities as nice as those anywhere: three rehearsal rooms, including one for the many percussion instruments that clang, boom or chime; a choir room; eight booths for individual practice or lessons; a large closet of roll-out cabinets for sheet music; and a two-story closet for hundreds of tuxedos of all sizes, on a conveyer system like those found at dry cleaners. The program has a huge booster program — two events this year raised $120,000, Mitchell said — but some of the band’s biggest fans are the coaches. Wootten said his son Brendan not only started at guard for one of his championship teams, but also played clarinet and trumpet for Mitchell’s top ensemble. McMahon, the principal, said that if there were a hall of fame for band directors, Mitchell would be in it. Tom Ponton, DeMatha’s director of development, called Mitchell “the Morgan Wootten of band directors.” Mitchell sat nearby. “I will never feel successful,” he deadpanned, “until I hear somebody say, ‘Morgan Wootten is the John Mitchell of basketball coaches.’ ”   A version of this article appears in print on May 10, 2011, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: At DeMatha, Sports and Music Play Well Together.
