Credit Bill Clark/Roll Call     Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a Tea Party favorite, is worried about economic unfairness. Here he is, arguing for what he calls a “conservative reform agenda”: Today, the United States is beset by a crisis in inequality. It’s not a crisis of unequal wealth or income, exactly – it’s a crisis of unequal opportunity. We see it up and down American society. The underprivileged are trapped in poverty, sometimes for generations. The middle class is caught on a treadmill, running harder every year just to maintain the economic security and social cohesion that were once taken for granted. Lee’s commentary reflects a break with conservative orthodoxy by one faction on the right, even as it remains consonant with a populist critique of elites: At the top of our society, we find political and economic elite increasingly exempted and insulated by law from the rigors of competition and the consequences of their own mistakes. Note that line about “the rigors of competition.” Lee and others of like mind are shifting the focus of populist anger from liberal elites to economic elites. They are challenging Democratic domination of issues like wage stagnation, the power of the 1 percent and the diminished opportunities a majority of Americans face. The Republican appropriation of leftist populist rhetoric (and even policies) poses a significant threat to liberal prospects in 2016. They plan to bring the fight to the Democrats on their own turf. But at the same time, the growth of dissension within Republican ranks on the question of what should be done about the economy and in whose name it should be done testifies to the strength of a contemporary reform conservative movement that has, somewhat oddly, become known as the “ reformicon ” movement. The origins of this development lie in the compassionate conservatism of George W. Bush’s 2000 campaign, which has now been adopted and amplified by a younger generation of conservatives intent on broadening the base of support for the party in a presidential election year.

Salam continues: Reform conservatives are just acknowledging the obvious: Government is in the business of protecting people from some of the downside risks of economic life, so we might as well get used to it. Reformicons go further than that, though, in arguing that government can do a lot of good, provided that it sticks to doing a few things well. Despite his Tea Party credentials, Senator Lee has won enthusiastic praise from reform conservatives . So, too, has Marco Rubio, the Florida senator sometimes called “the crown prince” of the Tea Party movement, who has become the darling of reform conservatives.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Rubio, who is among the small army of politicians considering a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed article with Lee last year, in which they pressed populist themes: Too many Americans believe the American dream is slipping away for them and their children. They see their cost of living rise while their paychecks remain stagnant. They see an economy that benefits stockbrokers but not stock clerks. They see the ladder of economic opportunity being pulled farther up and out of their reach. Lee and Rubio are proposing a major revision to the tax code, which calls for a substantial share of its benefits to be directed to the working and middle classes. Their revision would raise the refundable child care credit to $3,500 from $1,000. In addition, it would establish just two tax rates: 15 percent on earnings up to $87,850 for an individual ($175,700 for married couples), and 35 percent on all income over that. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center concluded that the Lee-Rubio proposal would cost the government $2.4 trillion in revenue over 10 years. Lee and Rubio have outraged many of their more traditional colleagues in the conservative movement by failing to endorse a major cut in the top rates of high-income taxpayers. Amity Shlaes , a former member of the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, and Matthew Denhart, a research fellow at the George W. Bush Presidential Center, were clearly incredulous in the critique of Lee-Rubio they wrote for National Review. Noting Rubio’s presidential aspirations, Shlaes and Denhart pointed out that the top marginal rate Mitt Romney proposed in February 2012 was 28 percent. If Rubio starts with a rate of 35 percent, he may well find himself at the current top statutory rate, nearly 40 percent, by the time he’s done negotiating. According to Shlaes and Denhart, their plan also sharply curtails the deductibility of state and local taxes. The pair would shrink America’s greatest tax break, the home-mortgage-interest deduction, so that deductibility applied only to the interest paid on the first $300,000 of a mortgage. It’s hard to imagine a Republican plan punishing professionals in expensive cities more. Lee and Rubio have received strong support from the reformicon movement. John Murray, founder and senior strategist at the YG (Young Guns) Network , an organization that promotes the reformicon agenda, argued in a Huffington Post piece: Not only can conservatives offer reforms that are both pro-growth and pro-family — we absolutely must do so in order to earn the trust and support of millions of Americans who are working hard to raise families and make a middle-class living. As Rubio and Lee write, 21st-century conservative reforms must not only “revive the American dream,” but also “make it more attainable for more Americans than ever before.” In a Feb. 4 essay titled “The G.O.P. should become the Party of Math,” James Pethokoukis, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, took the debate over the Lee-Rubio tax proposal a step further to attack what has been sacrosanct Republican thinking since Ronald Reagan’s campaign in 1980. “Many members of the G.O.P. coalition,” Pethokoukis writes, “will put considerable pressure on Republican 2016ers to offer the same-old, same-old solution: Cut the top personal income tax rate and hope an economic boom makes everyone better off.” Pethokoukis contends that fantasy tax-plan advocates have a big problem: Their math doesn’t work. First, the top tax rate has bounced up and down for more than 30 years, and growth has actually been faster when it’s been on the higher side. Pethokoukis doesn’t hold back: Fantasy economic plans based on ideological aspiration and Reagan-era nostalgia may be fun to talk about. But Republicans like to consider themselves hard-nosed realists who understand life is about trade-offs. They need to check their math. For the Republican Party, there are political advantages to the emergence of a diverse and often conflicting set of viewpoints that, taken together, soften the image of the party as a partisan monolith intolerant of new ideas.

In 2012, he faulted the hard-edged conservative tone of the Republican primary debates, saying: I used to be a conservative and I watch these debates and I’m wondering, I don’t think I’ve changed, but it’s a little troubling sometimes when people are appealing to people’s fears and emotion rather than trying to get them to look over the horizon for a broader perspective, and that’s kind of where we are. Bush is also exploring the use of populist themes . On his “Right to Rise PAC” website, he declares: Millions of our fellow citizens across the broad middle class feel as if the American dream is now out of their reach; that our politics are petty and broken; that opportunities are elusive; and that the playing field is no longer fair or level. Too many of the poor have lost hope that a path to a better life is within their grasp. While the last eight years have been pretty good ones for top earners, they’ve been a lost decade for the rest of America. Democrats counter this emerging Republican populism with the argument that Republicans have failed to follow up with legislation that would actually do something about the problem of inequality. The 2014 midterm elections demonstrated, however, that relatively modest shifts in tone — carefully combined with cost-free proposals like making over-the-counter contraceptives available — could help Republican candidates defuse the accusation that their party is out of touch on issues of importance to women and to show that they are willing to take a more pragmatic path. What should be most worrisome to Democrats is how far the Republican Party has traveled since issuing its self-critical post-2012 election report warning loyalists to stay off “scary” issues. If the Republican Party continues in its current direction – a very big if for a party with an adamantly conservative primary electorate — it’s Democrats who should be scared.

Her problem: “how to address the anger about income inequality without overly vilifying the wealthy.” The danger for Democrats is that they will lose ownership of the issues of stagnation, opportunity and fairness. But they also face what may be a deeper problem: What happens when their candidates are not the only ones who can harness the emotional power that stems from the anger many Americans feel as they helplessly watch the geyser of wealth shooting to the top? The real issue going into 2016 is: Can Republicans really abandon so central a pillar of conservative ideology as lower tax rates for those at the top of income distribution? Both parties have powerful constituencies that benefit not only from a reduced top rate, but from low capital gains rates, dividend breaks and cuts in the estate tax. If Republicans compromise on taxes, conservative Christians are going to worry that compromise on abortion will be next. Anti-immigrant forces are already convinced that Republican leaders will cave in to pressure to enact liberal immigration reform. Many of the party’s most loyal constituencies fear that if this leftward turn continues, the entire conservative edifice could implode. Democrats are banking on the strength of Republican forces that demand the maintenance of the status quo. When a potential candidate as prominent as Jeb Bush begins to defy the status quo, however, Democrats can no longer count on Republican intransigence. It would be a stunning setback for the party if Mike Lee, a Tea Party candidate who came out of nowhere in 2010, beat the Democrats at their own game.   The obligation to counter the Republicans falls on Hillary Clinton. Her supporters are aware that she must navigate between the party’s competing constituencies while simultaneously demonstrating that she is not beholden to the Democratic special interest group network. If the 2016 election becomes a Clinton-Bush contest (or Clinton versus someone else who is committed to reformicon principles), its outcome will be determined by the ability of each candidate to surmount the same hurdle, but from opposite directions. How do you speak for the economically insecure without offending the very secure?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   So far, of the two potential candidates, Bush has demonstrated a greater willingness to explore new policy terrain and to adapt his message to a changing economy. Clinton has her work cut out for her. For Clinton, figuring out how to maintain peace between the Wall Street wing of her party and its Elizabeth Warren wing will be as hard or perhaps even harder than Bush’s task of aligning populist Tea Party forces with the Republican establishment.
