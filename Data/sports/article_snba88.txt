Now, a month past her 18th birthday, she is a disappointed freshman at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas who is looking beyond the sport for a career. "I don't have any goals in tennis," Gottlieb said recently. "I don't want to play tennis on the tour. You don't have to play tennis for a living. Not a lot of people do." But if Gottlieb has chosen to bypass the rigors of a professional tennis career, her road from high school to college has been anything but routine. And as the National Collegiate Athletic Association studies a complaint about her high school academic record and the events that brought her from Ambler, Pa., to questionable eligibility at Nevada-Las Vegas, her case provides another example of the crisis that confronts college athletics, even in a non-revenue-producing sport like tennis. Allegations of abuses in the recruiting of high school athletes have become common, but they almost always involve football and basketball, which produce the most money and prestige. The N.C.A.A. says it has dealt with relatively few major violations in non-revenue-producing sports. But the ongoing dispute over how Gottlieb came to be enrolled at U.N.L.V. exemplifies the pressures that exist, in any sport, when a high school has an athlete whom a college wants.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The main issue under review in Gottlieb's case is whether the university, in admitting her, improperly recognized a high school marketing course that Gottlieb took at Upper Dublin High School but that educators at the high school say they had not certified as meeting N.C.A.A. standards. She was also given credit for an oceanography course that was not part of the high school's curriculum.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       There is little agreement on the matter between the high school and U.N.L.V. A university official said marketing and oceanography appeared on the N.C.A.A. form 48-H, which was sent by the high school to show certified courses, but the high school principal said the form sent with his signature did not list either course. The university official said the form was sent by a facsimile-producing (or fax) machine, but the principal said the high school mailed its version with Gottlieb's transcript. Now, the university and Gottlieb do not even agree on whether she is in school. Nevada-Las Vegas officials say she is not registered this semester, but Gottlieb contends she is attending classes and is indeed registered. These and other discrepancies underscore the complexity and pitfalls of the process by which high school athletes, especially those who are marginal students, are recruited and admitted into college. In that process, facts are debated or distorted, and the truth is hard to discern. In the wake of this process, a university is facing more questions about an already heavily scrutinized athletic department -- U.N.L.V.'s national champion basketball team will be ineligible for post-season play next season -- and a teen-ager's life has been turned upside down. Gottlieb was ranked No. 1 among girls' 16 singles players in the Philadelphia region by the Middle States Tennis Association for the 1989 season. Yale, Arkansas and Penn State sent her recruiting letters, but only Nevada-Las Vegas pursued her after receiving her transcript from Upper Dublin, in Fort Washington, Pa., from which Gottlieb graduated last June. Dr. Paul E. Burns, U.N.L.V.'s faculty representative to the N.C.A.A., who is also executive assistant to the senior vice president and provost, said Gottlieb was twice rejected for admission by the university, first by the admissions office and then on appeal to an eight-member faculty admissions committee. She was, however, allowed to attend summer school at U.N.L.V., to try to meet its entrance requirements. She again appealed to the provost's office, Burns said, and as the semester began last Aug. 27, the university admitted her as a special student through the student development office, put her on academic probation for her freshman year and, to make her eligible for tennis, recognized the marketing and oceanography courses.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The semester ended on Dec. 15, but on Jan. 23, Burns said Gottlieb "was not back in school this spring" and was no longer able to compete on the tennis team this season. He said the university had informed Gottlieb by letter on Jan. 9 that her admission was canceled. "As a probationary admission, she had to maintain a 2.0 average and complete six credits," Burns said. "She didn't fulfill that." But on Feb. 7, when reached by telephone at her apartment in Las Vegas, Gottlieb said: "Well, I am registered. I'm here. I'm going to school at U.N.L.V. during the day. I'm not playing this semester. I decided not to play." She said she could resume playing next year "if I want to." On Feb. 13, Burns reiterated that Gottlieb was not registered as a full-time or part-time student. He said that she could eventually reapply for admission, but that she would lose a year of eligibility because she had competed this season. Robert C. Field, the principal at Upper Dublin, said: "A little thing like this shows the kind of attitude that people are out there saying we can do anything we want to do and it doesn't make a bit of difference." He said a loophole exists for colleges to take chances on marginal students because the N.C.A.A. does not monitor academic records until it receives a complaint. "The N.C.A.A. has it backward," he said. "The N.C.A.A. is trying to police but doesn't have the information. Up front, it should require the high school to send the transcripts and the 48-H's to the N.C.A.A., so it certifies the kid meets the requirements." Last November, after Gottlieb's name appeared on the U.N.L.V. women's tennis team roster, the N.C.A.A. received a complaint from a source that it has kept confidential. Among the allegations, according to sources close to the case, are that U.N.L.V. knew Gottlieb did not meet the 2.0 average in the 11 N.C.A.A. required core-curriculum courses, like English and mathematics, and that courses were improperly recognized as ones that qualified; that U.N.L.V. improperly allowed her to take three summer-school courses to improve her record for eligibility, and that an attempt was made last summer to pressure the high school to change a grade of D to C in English in her senior year. At the request of Burns, Gottlieb signed a consent form allowing him to answer questions about her confidential high school record. He said Gottlieb had a 1.476 overall grade-point average on a scale of 4.0. A 1.0 was required for graduation. Her combined Scholastic Aptitude Test score was 760, meeting the N.C.A.A. required 700 out of 1,600. He said Gottlieb fell short of meeting the 2.0 minimum in the 11 N.C.A.A.-required core-curriculum courses. Only 3 of the 11 courses were taken from her senior year: world history, descriptive chemistry and marketing management, he said. Gottlieb's core-curriculum average rose to 2.09 after she was given credit for the marketing management course, he said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Field, the principal, said that along with Gottlieb's transcript, the high school mailed form 48-H, listing all the academic courses it certified as permissible for admission of a student-athlete. He said marketing and oceanography were not on the list. But Burns said Gottlieb's file contained a form 48-H that was sent by a facsimile machine on Aug. 27 from Kirkland Printing Company in Glenside, Pa., about six miles from the high school, to the university's athletic department. It was sent to the attention of Craig Witcher, the tennis coach, and York Strothers, an assistant coach. Burns said that copy was forwarded to Gottlieb's file, and it listed marketing and oceanography.

"He confirmed that marketing management is the same as marketing, and I show that note on the transcript I have." Burns said he had no written communication from the high school about that conversation. "In some cases I do make calls to try to confirm if something does count or find out if something is not there," he said. "The school, of course, determines what courses go on the 48-H." "Marketing is not on the 48-H we sent them," Field said. "It's unbelievable. How can they do that when they have our 48-H? That 48-H is what courses the school certifies as being acceptable. You know who certifies that? I do. If the guy says he's using marketing management, it's impossible. You can't get on the phone and get exceptions. It's wrong. We would never do that." On Feb. 13, a copy of the disputed form, provided by Burns, contained typed listings of marketing, under additional courses, and oceanography, under science courses, and the date of "8-27-90." Burns said that "oceanography fulfilled her science requirement." Gottlieb took oceanography as a junior at Miami Palmetto High School, from August 1988 to February 1989, while training and competing in Florida. After she transferred back, Upper Dublin allowed her to complete the course. But Fuery said it was not part of the school's curriculum. "We don't teach oceanography in the Philadelphia area," he said. Fuery said it was a "mystery" how marketing and oceanography were added to the form and then sent by a facsimile machine to U.N.L.V. Neither marketing management nor marketing is listed on the high school's official copy of the form. Nor is oceanography listed. Burns said he was puzzled, too. "I don't think anyone here was that desperate to have Heather in the program," he said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   According to Field, Fuery kept a "thorough" file on communications with U.N.L.V. about Gottlieb. "The file has 40 pieces of information," Field said. There are records of calls or correspondence from Larry Mason, U.N.L.V.'s director of admissions; Witcher, the tennis coach, and Mike Alsup, academic adviser for the basketball team, Field said. Field said Fuery told him: " 'Bob, we sent at least four transcripts. Everytime we sent one, they'd say they lost it.' " The 48-H form accompanied every mailed transcript, Field said. Burns said there was no original copy of the 48-H in the Gottlieb file in his possession. "I'm curious to see where the other 48-H forms ended up," he said. Last summer, Burns said, Gottlieb took two courses from June 11 to July 13, and received a D in the history of Nevada and a C in anthropology. From July 17 to Aug. 17, she retook the history course and earned a C and she received a B in theater arts. Burns said she finished the summer with nine credits and a 2.3 grade-point average. Burns said those grades helped Gottlieb to be admitted. "It would show that, in two courses that fulfill part of our core-curriculum requirements that all students have to meet, she was capable of doing at least average to above-average work," he explained. Burns said there was no consideration of her tennis background in granting the admission. But Field, citing the school file, said: "There's a record of the tennis coach calling at least four times. There's a copy of a letter from him requesting a transcript and asking that it be typed." He said the coach's correspondence began last spring. In the fall, Gottlieb was among five freshmen on the nine-member U.N.L.V. women's team and the only one from east of the Mississippi. The freshmen include Andre Agassi's cousin, Susan Agassi, from Las Vegas. In the team brochure, Witcher, the coach, said of Gottlieb: "She has a big serve and forehand. She hits the hardest on the team. She is mainly a backcourter." Gottlieb won two letters on the Upper Dublin team as a freshman and a sophomore. She did not play as a junior, because she was in Florida, or as a senior, because she was ineligible, according to Roberta Fontaine, her former high school coach.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   "For her age, she was tall and strong and lefty," Fontaine recalled. "She had a tremendous first serve. Tennis seemed to be the focus of everything that she did. She had a tennis mother, if I could put it that way. The mother thought she was going to be a pro at 14. Grades weren't that important: she didn't have to go to college because she was going on the tour." Attempts to reach Gottlieb's mother, Reeva Eisenberg, by telephone were unsuccessful. Messages left on Gottlieb's answering machine drew no response. Gottlieb's pursuit of tennis created a total of 150 absences in high school, according to her record. She occasionally attended the Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla. Working in the summer with a tutor, she made up failed courses to advance in class standing. On Jan. 30, Jacqueline Newtown, the academic adviser for U.N.L.V.'s tennis teams, said that neither Burns nor Witcher had told her that Gottlieb was ineligible. She said she had only met with Gottlieb twice. Expressing surprise over Gottlieb's absences in high school, Newtown said: "To have those kinds of absences gives a student a signal that this is all right, and by the time they get to us, it's so ingrained in them. People are at a terrible disadvantage when all they've been preparing for is tennis."    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
