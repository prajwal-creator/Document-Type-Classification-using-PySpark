For many users, especially in large companies, a slight improvement in speed or convenience may mean a large improvement in productivity or training speed. But such announcements may not mean so much to those of us who use a computer for limited personal or business purposes. A marginally swifter word-processing program, for instance, may not be worth the price when the computer spends most of its time waiting for us to think up the next word to type. And if the program is not just an upgraded version of the one we are already using, but an entirely different brand, the cost in time to learn a whole new set of conventions and commands should definitely give us pause. What attracts our attention is software that expands the things a computer can do. For high school students, their parents and counselors, College Explorer offers a streamlined way to narrow their choices of two- and four-year institutions. It contains information on about 2,800 educational institutions and offers several options for exploring the data.

The program will produce two lists. The A list contains all colleges, if any, that meet both the required and preferred conditions; the B list has those that offer all the requirements but not all the preferences.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Many other conditions can be specified, and the lists can be sorted by size, cost, acceptance rate, freshman test scores and minimum qualifying grades. There is also a profile of each school, with such information as academic characteristics, physical setting, housing and athletics. The 1988-89 tuition and other costs, deadlines and financial aid programs are also given. Although the same information is available in books, the computer's advantage is that it can quickly cut the search to manageable size.

It comes on one or two 5.25-inch disks, but a coupon is included to obtain a 3.5-inch version. The program is available for $49.95 from the College Board, 45 Columbus Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10023; telephone (212) 713-8000. It may also be ordered by mail, with a check or money order enclosed, from College Board Publications, Department N06, Box 886, New York, N.Y. 10101. Specify whether it is for I.B.M. (item no. 003195) or Apple (item no. 003187). College Explorer is a collection of information, a database. Another kind of database is one of those home medical books that you check when Timmy has a fever or Katie has a nosebleed. When not used as a substitute for professional diagnosis and treatment, these books can be genuinely helpful. FamilyCare Software is a collection of 1,500 questions and recommendations compiled by three practicing pediatricians on the faculty of Wayne State University. You select one of 46 medical areas, like eye problems or skin problems, or choose from an index of 650 items, and answer the questions posed by the program. Depending on the answers, the program will branch into different areas suggested by the symptoms and make a recommendation ranging from a mild ''All infants wake up at night'' to an imperative ''Get the child to the emergency room immediately.'' The questions are the sort a pediatrician might ask over the phone before deciding whether home, office or emergency room treatment is required. The answers struck this parent as sensible, conservatively leaning toward seeking medical help rather than ignoring a problem Although the program is simplicity itself to operate, it would be a good idea to get acquainted with it before you need it. The program requires at a minimum either an I.B.M.-compatible with at least 256 kilobytes of memory and one disk drive or a Macintosh with 512 kilobytes of memory and one 800K or two 400K disk drives. The program is a product of the FamilyCare Software Division of Lundin Laboratories, 29451 Greenfield Road, Suite, 216, Southfield, Mich. 48076; telephone (800) 426-8426. It costs $99.
