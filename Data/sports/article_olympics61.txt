Phelps, a 14-time Olympic gold medalist, swam the two-lap final in 50.22 seconds at the Indiana University Natatorium. He lowered Ian Crocker ’s mark of 50.40 seconds, set at the 2005 world championships in Montreal. Wearing his usual Speedo LZR suit, Phelps led at 50 meters with a split of 23.83, just three-tenths off world-record pace. Known for his strong finishes, he pulled clear down the stretch to beat Tyler McGill, who touched in 51.06. Aaron Peirsol was third in 51.30. “Crock had a ton more first 50 speed than I did,” Phelps said, referring to Crocker. “That’s something I’ve really been working on. I’ve always been able to come home pretty strong. I finally got the front half a little bit faster. If I can get that even faster, I’ll be in better shape.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Phelps holds individual world records in the 100- and 200-meter butterfly, the 200 and 400 individual medley, and the 200 free. Phelps had the 100 fly mark for a day at the 2003 world meet in Barcelona. But Crocker took it from him a day later, then lowered it twice more.

We had amazing battles back and forth. Those are something I definitely miss.” Crocker has not swum competitively since losing the 100 fly to Phelps at the Beijing Olympics, where Phelps won a record eight gold medals.

He already qualified in the 200 fly and 200 freestyle as he continued his transformation from swimming middle distances to sprints. His success comes after a rocky post-Olympic period in which he took a six-month break and was photographed using a marijuana pipe, resulting in a three-month suspension by USA Swimming. That ended in early May and then Phelps, 24, lost some races while preparing for nationals. Dara Torres, 42, is also going to Rome, winning the 50 free despite an ailing left knee with a torn tendon and arthritis. She plans to have surgery later this summer. Torres clocked 24.43, well off her American record of 24.07 set at the Beijing Olympics. It will be her first appearance at the world championships since 1986. “It’s a great feeling to be able to come out here and still race, but that time won’t medal at the world championships,” she said.

César Cielo of Brazil clocked 21.14 to win the B final, in which he and Fred Bousquet of France were relegated because only Americans are allowed in the A final. Bousquet, the world-record holder, finished second in 21.36. Their times  —  the fastest ever on American soil  —  would have put them 1-2 in the event. The Olympic teammates Cullen Jones, who qualified fastest, and Garrett Weber-Gale tied for second in 21.55 in the A final, setting up a swim-off Saturday. Elizabeth Beisel, 16, qualified for her first world championships with a victory in the 400 individual medley. She finished in 4:36.31 and Julia Smit, already on the national team, was second. Rebecca Soni, the Olympic silver medalist, won the 100 breaststroke in an American-record time of 1:05.34.
