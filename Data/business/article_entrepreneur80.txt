Take a seat. Which Mr. Brill did, though in the conference room of his own offices in Manhattan. I’m the good cop. I maintain that Mr. Brill’s Registered Traveler program makes sense for frequent travelers, though I’ve expressed qualms about the hurdles put up by the Transportation Security Administration.  So far, those hurdles have prevented the program from offering much more than a special security checkpoint and a biometric identity  card. Mr. Brancatelli, the publisher of Joesentme.com , a business travel Web site, is the bad cop who has  called the program an idea “whose time has come and gone without actually having arrived.” Mr. Brill, the journalist, media entrepreneur and founder of Court TV, is a true believer, of course. His company, Verified Identity Pass Inc., opened a version of the program under the Clear brand name in Orlando, Fla., in July 2005, and has recently opened checkpoints in Indianapolis, Cincinnati and San Jose, Calif., as well as  Terminal 7 at Kennedy International Airport. Next month, Terminals 1 and 4 at Kennedy and Terminal B at Newark Liberty International Airport will be added.

One reason is that the Transportation Security Administration has taken longer than expected in approving various technologies that will offer members time-saving benefits, like not having to remove their shoes and coats.

Skeptics like Mr. Brancatelli have suggested he made a bad bet against an intractable bureaucracy. Mr. Brill disagreed.  “I’ve looked at this from the perspective of someone who had an idea to launch a cable channel featuring cameras in the courtroom when most states didn’t allow cameras in the courtroom,” Mr. Brill said of starting  Court TV in 1991. It was later sold to Time Warner, and described by Wired Magazine as “the law’s interface to the public.” In 2003, Mr. Brill wrote a book, “After: The Rebuilding and Defending of America in the Sept. 12 Era,” that addressed matters like threats and risks and how to confront them. He said that the Registered Traveler program then came to mind.  Photo         Credit Chris Gash    “I just kept saying to myself, ‘this is such a good idea, and it’s so logical that it ought to happen,’ ” he said. “So, I decided to do it.” He was aware, he said, that creating the program would be “a long haul that depends on a lot of different pieces falling into place, some of which are very difficult, like changing bureaucracies’ views of the world.” In Congressional testimony in November 2005, Mr. Brill said that “if the T.S.A. mapped a clear blueprint” offering obvious benefits at the checkpoints, “we and our competitors would likely be rolled out at 30 or 40 of the largest 50 airports within six months.” Since then, many news accounts critical of the slow rollout have omitted the “if” in Mr. Brill’s 2005 statement.

But, Mr. Brancatelli said: “If you were doing my job as a columnist, wouldn’t you say, ‘why doesn’t this guy see what I see?’ And what I see is a bureaucracy that doesn’t want you and will do anything it can to stop you.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   To which Mr. Brill responded, “Where does it say I don’t see that? Do I have any doubt that there are lots of people at T.S.A. who would just as soon see this program go away? No.” But, he said, that the 40,000 members are an influential “constituency” and that the signals he gets from top government security officials are that the new technology will be approved after thorough evaluation. The biggest hurdle so far came in Orlando, when Clear began using a long-awaited Secure Registered Traveler Kiosk developed by GE Security, which integrates explosives detection, shoe scanning and biometric identification. But the machines, which were expected to routinely clear most travelers’ shoes, instead rejected more than 50 percent for containing metal, thus negating one of the major advertised benefits. What Mr. Brill calls Version II of the kiosk technology is now being designed, under federal review, to differentiate “O.K. metal versus dangerous metal,” he said. If approved, “you could go from clearing 60 to 70 percent of the shoes to clearing 95 percent.” He said he expected Version II to be approved and to expand to other airports in a month or so. The Registered Traveler rollout, meanwhile,  slowly chugs along. Yesterday, Mr. Brill’s company announced that it expected to begin operations at the airport in Albany in about two months.
