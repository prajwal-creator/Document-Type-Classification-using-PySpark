The money contributed to the athletic facilities of one program was noted, but alumni and other contributions, financial and otherwise, were ignored. I am the direct beneficiary of such contributions, as an Angier B. Duke scholar. My colleagues at Duke, some of whom “tented,” include poets, professors, White House fellows, physicians and, yes, some Wall Street bankers. For many of us, basketball games were a chance to blow off steam from the exhausting rigor of university life. MELISSA A. WALKER Boston  To the Sports Editor: I applaud the Duke professor Charles T. Clotfelter for reminding us that universities are supposed to be for learning. Semiprofessional sports teams on campus distract from the educational mission. They degrade the intellectual level. They reinforce many students’ notion that college is four years of good times and rooting for the home team followed by the receipt of a credential. GREGORY PALERMO Edgartown, Mass.  To the Sports Editor: Duke professors may be envious of their coaching counterparts. But if the take-home pay for those in the biology department is outpacing that of their peers elsewhere, I suspect the professors are lustily screaming alongside their students at Cameron Indoor Stadium.

And I have to believe that life and finances at Duke are poorer without Krzyzewskiville.

But it does not take a Duke partisan to see that similar basketball scenes are now present at places as different from Duke, and from one another, as the University of Kansas and San Diego State. Are we to conclude that the Jayhawks and the Aztecs faithful, who can also do a pretty good imitation of “a mosh pit inside a jet engine during a hurricane,” or the similar contingents of fans at other colleges are also being prepared for jobs with big banks and law firms, service on corporate boards, and membership at country clubs? College students everywhere act nuts, and acting nuts about basketball, whatever it may be, is not a sign of elitism. LEN SIMON San Diego Old Enough to Be a Knick To the Sports Editor: Re “C’mon, Knicks: Go Bold. Go Old,” Feb. 22: The Knicks need to move forward and prepare for the future. Their team right now consists of several players who, by N.B.A. standards, could be described as geriatric. So it really made no sense why they chose to get rid of a young, talented player like Ronnie Brewer and pick up 35-year-old Kenyon Martin. But as long as we are making the argument that they should bring in some older talent, Shaquille O’Neal should definitely be in the conversation. The man played over 15 dominant seasons in big markets like Los Angeles and Miami, so New York seems like a rational next step. Even if he is 50 pounds overweight, you can’t teach height. GRIFFIN GLENN North Caldwell, N.J.   A version of this letter appears in print on March 3, 2013, on Page SP4 of the New York edition with the headline: Under Duke’s Big Tent.
