Here’s what we’re watching: • Facebook’s stock slides as lawmakers want answers on the latest controversy. • Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat following the Cambridge Analytica revelations. • Congress is racing to complete its spending bill. • U.S. companies warn President Trump about sweeping tariffs. Get this in your inbox every morning. Sign up here . Larry Ellison and Dr. David Agus unveil their hydroponic farming start-up. Larry Ellison is the founder of Oracle and the 10th-richest man on the planet, according to Forbes. Dr. David Agus is a best-selling author and physician whose clients included Steve Jobs and Sumner Redstone. Of all the companies the two could have started together, they’ve chosen an unusual approach: a hydroponic farming start-up focused on creating more healthful food.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       S ilicon Valley Start-up Plenty raised $200 million from SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund. Bowery Farming, whose vegetables are now sold in a few grocery stores in New York City, has collected money from the likes of Google’s venture arm and General Catalyst. Sensei is focused more on wellness. While the company ultimately plans to expand into an array of businesses, its initial focus is on hydroponic farming, using software and sensors to monitor growing conditions. (Its first farm is on Lanai, the Hawaiian island of which Mr. Ellison owns roughly 98 percent .) Sensei’s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre. “So far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,” Dr. Agus said in a statement. “To properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.” Its first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables. But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods. “For so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,” Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei’s president, said in a statement. “Now, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   — Michael de la Merced                Facebook’s slide drags down FANG stocks. Facebook’s stock had its worst day in about four years. Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles. The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world’s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry’s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models. Facebook’s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February. “We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,” said Brian Wieser , an analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group. Facebook’s woes showed signs of spreading, too. The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index’s 11 sectors. Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent. In all, Monday’s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.                Fund flows added fuel to the selloff. MoneyBeat’s Akane Otani reports that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds tracking U.S. technology stocks posted a record $2.6 billion in net inflows last week, according to data from fund tracker EPFR Global. That put year-to-date inflows at $47.5 billion. “The record-setting stream of money into stock funds has underlined how much the market has been driven by investor fervor for a handful of popular names , which some say makes stocks vulnerable to sudden reversals.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 336 points, or 1.35 percent, while the S.&P. 500, was off nearly 39 points, or 1.42 percent.  Photo        A senator demanded that Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a British lawmaker has called for him to testify in an inquiry into the “Brexit” referendum.   Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times    The latest test to Zuckerberg’s leadership. Is Mark Zuckerberg’s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company? The giant social media company is under the spotlight because a political data firm apparently misused information about more than 50 million Facebook users. Facebook is still facing questions about Russia-linked accounts that had significant reach within the United States through the social network. In both cases, Facebook has struggled to show the public that it can get in front of its problems. Information about the Russia-linked accounts came out piecemeal , and Facebook knew as early as 2015 that the political data firm had violated its data policies. Mr. Zuckerberg at first downplayed concerns about Facebook’s role in the 2016 presidential election (something he later said he regretted). His recent communications contain more high-minded deliberation than hard discussion of the company’s problems and how to deal with them. These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security. Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company’s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook’s profitability. Indeed, there’s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg’s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise. In the near term, though, it’s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook’s extraordinary profitability – its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue – will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If governments propose restrictions on using members’ data, Facebook’s business model would be tested. The company’s board, in theory, should press Mr. Zuckerberg for details on how he will deal with such shackles. But prominent board members like Marc L. Andreessen and Peter A. Thiel are skeptical of regulation. Facebook might be tempted to fight back. Lawmakers may hold the line, however, sensing that the public has real concerns about the company. And if Facebook’s responses look tardy and inadequate, the consequences could be harsh, as the fate of Wells Fargo shows . Mr. Zuckerberg, in his uniquely dominant position, is the one person who can make sure this doesn’t happen. — Peter Eavis Lawmakers want answers on Facebook’s latest controversy Lawmakers in the U.S. and Britain want Mark Zuckerberg to explain how Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm founded by Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer, harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles. “It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves,” tweeted Senator Amy Klobuchar , a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. What happened:  The NYT and The Observer of London reported how Cambridge had collected data from an outside researcher to better target Facebook users. Christopher Wylie, who oversaw Cambridge’s data collection until 2014, told the NYT of his former company, “For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.” Facebook argued that the incident wasn’t a data breach and that Cambridge had committed a violation. But former Federal Trade Commission officials told the WaPo that Facebook may have violated a privacy pact reached with the regulator. (The tech giant is reviewing whether one of its employees had been aware of the data leak .) More on Cambridge Analytica: Alexander Nix, the company’s chief, is facing scrutiny over business dealings with Russian interests . Mr. Wylie said that one Russian company, the oil giant Lukoil, appeared more interested in political message targeting than commercial uses. And Cambridge is reportedly trying to block the airing of a report by Channel 4, a British television channel, in which reporters went undercover at the firm. Critic’s corner Jeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes: “Facebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn’t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.”  Photo        A fleet of self-driving Uber cars in 2016.

Puskar/Associated Press    A self-driving Uber car kills a pedestrian. A woman in Tempe, Ariz., has died after being hit by a self-driving car operated by Uber , in what appears to be the first known death of a pedestrian struck by an autonomous vehicle on a public road.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman, who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk, the Tempe police said in a statement. The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p.m. The woman was not publicly identified. Uber said it had suspended testing of its self-driving cars in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. “Our hearts go out to the victim’s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,” an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement. The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver’s seat. This month, California said that, in April, it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel. — Daisuke Wakabayashi  Photo        Michael W.

Credit David Paul Morris/Bloomberg    Michael Ferro has stepped down as chairman of Tronc. The newspaper publisher announced Monday that Michael W. Ferro Jr., a Chicago entrepreneur and its biggest shareholder, has stepped down as the company’s chairman. The move came just weeks after Mr. Ferro helped negotiate the sale of Tronc’s crown jewel , The Los Angeles Times. Justin Dearborn, the company’s chief executive, will replace Mr. Ferro as chairman. “I am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation,” Mr. Ferro said in a statement. Mr. Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc. But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny. — Sydney Ember The LTSE takes a step to make companies think about the long term. The Long-Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long-term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX. The filing — which will commence the public part of the S.E.C.’s review of the rule changes at IEX — advances the LTSE’s aim of enshrining what it believes are best practices in running companies into corporate charters. If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE’s founder, Eric Ries. It also formalizes a tie-up between LTSE and IEX , the exchange best known as the subject of Michael Lewis’s “Flash Boys.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story  The All-New DealBook Newsletter  Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.

Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The context • Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. “Most of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,” he told me. “That frees up management to do what’s right.” • It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarter’s targets than longer-term goals. • LTSE’s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles. • LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors. The caveat It’s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public. “What we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,” Mr. Ries said. — Michael de la Merced  Photo         Credit Win Mcnamee/Getty Images    It’s budget time, and Congress is preparing to spend Friday is the deadline for lawmakers to pass a budget, and they are considering a plan that would cost more than $1 trillion .

Consider: • Mr. Jacobs would probably have to pay more than the $117 billion that Broadcom offered. • He only owns about 1 percent of the company. Mr. Dell owned 14 percent of his. • He would have to bring in significant equity partners, since there is no way he could finance a takeover with debt alone.
