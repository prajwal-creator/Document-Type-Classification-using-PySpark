McKennon Shea, a United Methodist minister, at the Duke University Chapel in Durham, N.C. The bride, 30, will continue to use her name professionally. She is a financial adviser, specializing in mergers and acquisitions, at Evercore Partners, an investment bank in New York. She graduated cum laude from Duke and received an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania. She is the daughter of Victoria Salazar and Alfonso Salazar of Whittier, Calif. The bride’s father is a service technician for gas appliances with the Southern California Gas Company in Los Angeles. Her mother is a secretary at the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office. The groom, 32, is a consultant at Accenture, the information technology and management consultancy, in New York. He also graduated from Duke. He is a son of Jo Willa Gramling Lopez of Gramling, S.C., and Otto B. Lopez of Bedminster, N.J. His mother is the executive director of the Children’s Advocacy Center of Spartanburg, Cherokee and Union Counties in Spartanburg, S.C., which is part of the National Children’s Alliance, a national organization in Huntsville, Ala., that seeks to help children who have been victims of abuse. She retired as the general counsel for global banking from Merrill Lynch in New York. His father, who also is retired, was a director of operations at Merrill Lynch and also worked in New York. He was in charge of the process that provided clients with tax forms. The couple met in October 2006 at a gathering of Duke graduates in New York. Ms. Salazar and Mr. Lopez had been students there at the same time, but had never met. Ms. Salazar found this puzzling.

She was dating someone else at the time, so she never called, and Mr. Lopez tried to put her out of his mind.

Mr. Lopez showed up, having missed the “ladies only” line in the message. When he got to the bar and saw Ms. Salazar he was delighted. As it turned out, no one else she knew had come and the two of them began talking. “Prince Charming came to rescue me sitting alone in the bar,” she said. “But I was still not romantically inclined.” They both enjoyed the game, which Duke won, and discovered that they had more in common — work and being the children of immigrants — than college. Ms. Salazar’s parents are from Mexico; Mr. Lopez’s father came from Cuba. They made plans to meet for the next Duke game and did so for the rest of the basketball season, whenever Mr. Lopez was not traveling for work. When the season ended, Ms. Salazar thought she would not see him until the next season. But on May 4, he called and asked if she wanted to get together the next day to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. Ms. Salazar said yes, assuming it would be the usual: a friendly time. Yet when they saw each other, both sensed it was something more. They shared their first kiss that night.
