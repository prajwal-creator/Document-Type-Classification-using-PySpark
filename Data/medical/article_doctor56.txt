But the most emotionally involving performance comes from Alessandro Nivola (kneeling, with Mr. Cooper) as a surgeon suffering a crisis of faith. Scott Ellis directs a cast that also includes an eccentric Patricia Clarkson (1:55). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, Manhattan, 212-239-6200, elephantmanbroadway.com.

Previews and Openings ‘Between Riverside and Crazy’ (in previews; opens on Feb. 11 ) Stephen Adly Guirgis’s rich play — about a man of many grudges in a rent-controlled apartment — resides somewhere south of cozy and north of dangerous. Stephen McKinley Henderson leads a cast in embodying characters who are utterly believable and not to be believed. Austin Pendleton directs this play, which is returning to the stage after a successful run at the Atlantic Theater Company last summer. Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, 212-246-4422, 2st.com. (Ben Brantley) ‘Big Love’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 23) A play with a body count to make most slasher flicks seem positively prim, Charles Mee’s rewriting of Aeschylus’s “The Danaids” finds 50 brides fleeing their grooms. But the grooms are in hot pursuit. Tina Landau directs for the Signature Theater, with a cast that includes Bobby Steggert and Rebecca Naomi Jones. Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Alexis Soloski) ‘Brooklynite’ (previews start on Friday; opens on Feb. 25) What power should a Brooklyn superhero have? Invisibility? Flight? The ability to rock a locally designed, sustainable cape? In this new musical inspired by the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company, a would-be superhero and a jaded crusader unite to save the borough. Written by Michael Mayer and Peter Lerman, the script is based on characters created by Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman. Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, 212-353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Soloski) ‘City Of’ (in previews; opens on Thursday) Last summer the Playwrights Realm brought us into the kitchen of an Upper East Side French restaurant. This time they’re taking us to France. In Anton Dudley’s play, directed by Stephen Brackett, four far-from-home Americans wander a Paris of gargoyles, absinthe and poetry. The cast features Colby Minifie, Steven Rattazzi and Suzanne Bertish. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, 212-279-4200, playwrightsrealm.org. (Soloski) ‘The Events’ (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Feb. 12) How do we make sense of inexplicable tragedy? How do we find the melody, the harmony? The Scottish playwright David Greig explores these questions, verbally and musically, in this piece, an Actors Touring Company Production and standout at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2013. Inspired in part by the mass murder in Norway in 2011, the play explores the effects of violence on a community as local choirs (a different one each night) offer accompaniment. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, 212-279-4200, nytw.org. (Soloski) ‘Everything You Touch’ (in previews; opens on Feb. 12) A new show by Sheila Callaghan? Whatever will you wear? This fashion-forward play, produced by Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, True Love Productions and The Theatre @ Boston Court and directed by Jessica Kubzansky, sashays between the 1970s and the present day. A contemporary woman menaced by three models finds her past entwined with a haughty couturier and his muse. Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, 866-811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Soloski) ‘Fashions for Men’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on March 1) If you could compare theaters to clothing boutiques, then think of the Mint Theater as a treasure trove of vintage looks. Its latest discovery: This Ferenc Molnár play from 1917 about the angelic owner of a haberdashery. Davis McCallum, who led the Mint’s “London Wall,” will direct in high style. 311 West 43rd Street, 866-811-4111, minttheater.org. (Soloski) ‘Fish in the Dark’ (previews start on Monday; opens on March 5) “I don’t even like the theater!,” Larry David of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” recently told David Letterman. But is that really the case, since he has written and is starring in this Broadway comedy, directed by Anna D. Shapiro? Details are scarce (all we know is that it’s about a family dealing with a death) and expectations incredibly high. But while Broadway is a big pond, Mr. David is a pretty sizable chunk of seafood. Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, 212-239-6200, fishinthedark.com. (Soloski) ‘Hamilton’ (in previews; opens on Feb. 17) Lin-Manuel Miranda descends from the Heights to the base of the New Jersey Palisades for his latest work. A hip-hop history of the United States’ hunkiest founding father (sorry, James Madison), the story follows Alexander Hamilton from his birth in the West Indies through his storied political career to his ignoble death below the Weehawken cliffs. Thomas Kail, also of “In the Heights,” directs a cast of two dozen, with Mr. Miranda as Hamilton. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, publictheater.org. (Soloski) ‘The Iceman Cometh’ (previews start on Thursday; opens on Feb. 12) And the audience doesn’t goeth for nearly five hours. Nathan Lane and Brian Dennehy star in this revival of Eugene O’Neill’s saloon-set drama, which had a critically acclaimed run in Chicago in 2012. The Goodman Theater and the director Robert Falls have transported their rendering of Harry Hope’s bar, which Charles Isherwood called a “sterling new production” of a “tough, loquacious, magnificent play,” to the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Harvey Theater. 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Soloski) ‘The Insurgents’ (previews start on Thursday; opens on Feb. 23) You have to be in a pretty dark place to look for guidance from Timothy McVeigh. In Lucy Thurber’s new play, produced by Labyrinth Theater Company, Cassie Beck stars as a troubled woman who communes with McVeigh, Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman and other figures. The director Jackson Gay oversees the theatrical insurrection. Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, 212-513-1080, labtheater.org. (Soloski) ‘Lady, Be Good’ (performances start on Wednesday) Oh, the things we do for love. And money. And a great song-and-dance number. In this George and Ira Gershwin musical from 1924, revived by Encores! and directed by Mark Brokaw, Danny Gardner and Patti Murin star as insolvent siblings trying to marry up. If the plot doesn’t fascinate, the rhythm will. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Soloski) ‘The Lion’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 8) The engaging singer-songwriter Benjamin Scheuer is the sole performer in this autobiographical show, which is being revived after a run last year at City Center’s Studio II. In his folk-pop songs, Mr. Scheuer reflects on his complicated relationship with his father, who inspired his love of music but also left more troubling legacies. Lynn Redgrave Theater at Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, cultureproject.org. (Charles Isherwood) ‘Little Children Dream of God’ (in previews; opens on Feb. 17) You wouldn’t think that much besides rats could survive so far below the street, but for eight seasons Roundabout Underground has presented early-career playwrights in its subterranean black-box space. Its latest offering, by Jeff Augustin, concerns a Haitian mother-to-be, Sula (Carra Patterson), seeking refuge in the United States. Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Soloski) ‘Lives of the Saints’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 24) David Ives has never really gone in for hagiography. His short plays prefer life’s losers and sad sacks to its miracle workers. So we’ll see how many halos he distributes in this new evening of short works, directed by John Rando and produced by Primary Stages. Actors available for canonization include Arnie Burton, Carson Elrod and Liv Rooth. The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, 646-223-3010, primarystages.org. (Soloski) ‘The Mystery of Love & Sex’ (previews start on Thursday; opens on March 2) The director Sam Gold and the playwright Bathsheba Doran, who collaborated on the 2011 show “Kin,” reunite for another study of relations and relationships. Gayle Rankin and Mamoudou Athie are playmates in the Deep South. But as they age and their families become involved, their games get a lot more complicated. Diane Lane and Tony Shalhoub also star. Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 212-239-6200, lct.org. (Soloski) ‘The Nether’ (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Feb. 24) You might think of theater as the original virtual reality, but Jennifer Haley’s play takes place in a more contemporary one, an online world that encourages its inhabitants to act out their most perverse fantasies. Merritt Wever plays a detective assigned to untangle this corner of the web. Anne Kauffman directs. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, 866-811-4111, mcctheater.org. (Soloski) ‘Pretty Filthy’ (previews start on Saturday; opens on Feb. 8) Now for some very adult entertainment: The documentary troupe the Civilians traipsed to the San Fernando Valley, interviewing — and occasionally assisting — various members of the porn industry as they went about their show business. The playwright Bess Wohl and the composer Michael Friedman have assembled a musical from their findings. Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, 866-811-4111, abronsartscenter.org. (Soloski) ‘Rasheeda Speaking’ (in previews; opens on Feb. 11) In Joel Drake Johnson’s play, two receptionists at a Chicago doctor’s office make coffee, tote pastry, schedule appointments and take part in an increasingly stark drama of prejudice and paranoia. Cynthia Nixon makes her directorial debut for the New Group with a cast that includes Tonya Pinkins and Dianne Wiest. Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-279-4200, thenewgroup.org. (Soloski) ‘Verité’ (previews start on Saturday; opens on Feb. 18) The comic playwright Nick Jones last appeared at Lincoln Center with “The Coward.” In this new piece, directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, the hero is feeling just a little more brave. Anna Camp (“True Blood”) plays a modern mommy who is encouraged by publishers to make her life a lot more exciting. Lincoln Center, Claire Tow Theater, 150 West 65 Street, 212-239-6200, lct.org/lct3. (Soloski) ‘The World of Extreme Happiness’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 24) In Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig’s play, a newborn in rural China is immediately thrust into a bucket of pig slop. But this inauspicious welcome doesn’t stop the ambitious Sunny (played by the reliably terrific Jennifer Lim) from aspiring to a brighter, cleaner future. Eric Ting directs this co-production of the Manhattan Theater Club and the Goodman Theater. City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Soloski) Broadway ‘Aladdin’ Casey Nicholaw (“The Book of Mormon”) directs and choreographs (and choreographs, and choreographs) the latest Disney musical, adapted from the 1992 animated movie. While the familiar formulas are not entirely abandoned, Mr. Nicholaw and the book writer, Chad Beguelin, stuff so much splashy, shticky business into this show that the more syrupy bits hardly register. James Monroe Iglehart stands out as the showboating, scene-stealing genie (2:20). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, 866-870-2717, aladdinthemusical.com. (Isherwood) ‘Cabaret’ Only a decade after it closed, Sam Mendes and Rob Marshall’s popular, audience-teasing reincarnation of this classic musical feels as if it never left us. Alan Cumming seems to be having the time of his life reprising the creepy, tragic M.C., a role he redefined for the ages. In her Broadway debut, Emma Stone is scintillating as an attention-addicted Sally Bowles (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley) ★ ‘Constellations’ Who knew that higher physics could be so sexy, so accessible — and so emotionally devastating? Nick Payne’s gorgeous two-character drama, starring a perfectly matched Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Wilson (directed by Michael Longhurst), may be the most sophisticated date play ever. The classic boy-meets-girl story receives the quantum multiverse treatment (that’s parallel universes to you), to heart-clutching effect (1:10). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, 212-239-6200, constellationsbroadway.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time’ Simon Stephens’s adaptation of Mark Haddon’s best-selling novel, about an autistic boy’s coming-of-age, is one of the most fully immersive works ever to wallop Broadway. Be prepared to have all your emotional and sensory buttons pushed. Marianne Elliott (“War Horse”) directs the excellent cast, led by Alex Sharp, and the dazzling technical team (2:25). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, 212-239-6200, curiousonbroadway.com. (Brantley) ‘A Delicate Balance’ Though embodied by the stellar likes of Glenn Close and John Lithgow, the angsty suburbanites at the center of Pam MacKinnon’s revival of Edward Albee’s existential drawing-room drama have the flattened dimensions of specimens under glass. The cast (with the welcome exceptions of Clare Higgins and Bob Balaban) seems to be giving us the play instead of living it (2:45). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, 212-329-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Disgraced’ Ayad Akhtar’s tense, turbulent Pulitzer Prize-winner about the clash between Islamic faith and modern culture comes roaring onto Broadway with a superb, mostly new cast under Kimberly Senior’s taut direction. Hari Dhillon gives a coiled, stealthy performance as the Pakistani-born, well-heeled and thoroughly assimilated New Yorker whose assumptions about his identity are shaken when his complacent life comes unraveled. Gretchen Mol is excellent as his artist wife, and Josh Radnor (“How I Met Your Mother”), Karen Pittman and Danny Ashok give fine support (1:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, disgracedonbroadway.com. (Isherwood) ‘The Elephant Man’ Bradley Cooper distorts himself with self-obliterating grace in this sturdy revival of Bernard Pomerance’s instructive, carefully arranged drama about a freak of nature in Victorian England. But the most emotionally involving performance comes from Alessandro Nivola as a surgeon suffering a crisis of faith. Scott Ellis directs a cast that also includes an eccentric Patricia Clarkson (1:55). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, elephantmanbroadway.com. (Brantley) ‘Hedwig and the Angry Inch’ John Cameron Mitchell plays an “internationally ignored song stylist” of uncertain gender in his and Stephen Trask’s 1998 rock musical about love and loss. Michael Mayer directed this mightily entertaining exercise in crowd control (1:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, 212-239-6200, hedwigbroadway.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Honeymoon in Vegas’ Andrew Bergman’s screwball musical asks New York to wake up and smell the mai tais. Directed by Gary Griffin, with a swinging score by Jason Robert Brown and a pricelessly deadpan star turn from Tony Danza, this production presents Sin City as a little hip, a little square, a little dangerous, a little kitschy and a lot of fun (2:30). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, 877-250-2929, honeymoonbroadway.com. (Brantley) ‘If/Then’ This new musical from Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey (“Next to Normal”) is a gleaming drawing board of a show, full of polished surfaces and clearly drawn lines. The shiny-voiced Idina Menzel portrays a conflicted urban planner pondering two different roads her life might have taken. The show feels less like a variation on a theme than a dogged reiteration of it (2:35). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, 877-250-2929, ifthenthemusical.com. (Brantley) ‘It’s Only a Play’ Names drop like hailstones in this revised revival of Terrence McNally’s comedy about the anxious opening night of a Broadway turkey. Celebrity performers (including Matthew Broderick and Stockard Channing) sling a lot of mud at other celebrities, sometimes hilariously. Jack O’Brien directs with gusto this fizzy, overlong work that eventually goes flat. Martin Short has joined the cast as a former stage star turned TV actor (2:30). Bernard Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, itsonlyaplay.com. (Brantley) ‘Les Misérables’ It’s back — again. Capitalizing on the popular movie, Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil’s musical, about the French fellow who steals a loaf of bread and lives to regret it, storms Broadway in a new production. Ramin Karimloo, as the long-suffering bread-stealer, and Will Swenson, as his relentless foe, give sterling performances (2:50). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) ★ ‘On the Town’ John Rando’s take on this merry mating dance of a musical from 1944, about sailors on shore leave, feels as fresh as first sunlight. With airborne choreography by Joshua Bergasse, the production presents a parallel-universe New York where hectic urban life acquires the grace of a storybook ballet. It’s a bustling, jostling cartoon that floats like a swan (2:35). Lyric Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, 800-982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley) ‘The River’ Playing a withholding man in a woodland cabin in Jez Butterworth’s cryptic tease of a play, Hugh Jackman squelches his natural urge to ingratiate and ascends to a new level as a stage actor. Comparable claims cannot be made for Mr. Butterworth’s willfully enigmatic drama, though it has been beautifully staged by Ian Rickson. Expect to leave hungry (1:25). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, 212-239-6200, theriveronbroadway.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘You Can’t Take It With You’ A lot of shows make you laugh. But Scott Ellis’s felicitous revival of Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman’s 1936 comedy about an improbably happy family has you beaming from curtain to curtain. The delicious assorted nuts onstage include James Earl Jones, Kristine Nielsen and the sly comic genius Annaleigh Ashford (2:20). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) Off Broadway ‘A Beautiful Day in November on the Banks of the Greatest of the Great Lakes’ The oddball title is an entirely apt one for Kate Benson’s quirky comedy about the havoc that holiday get-togethers can bring about. Set on Thanksgiving, and analyzed by two commentators watching from above, Ms. Benson’s stylized play is like a cross between “SportsCenter” and a dysfunctional-family drama (1:15). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood) ‘The Bullpen’ Joe Assadourian, who served 12 years in prison for attempted murder, wrote and stars in this very funny one-man show about the characters he met while awaiting his trial (1:05). Playroom Theater, 151 West 46th Street, 212-967-8278, stepinthebullpen.com. (Ken Jaworowski) ‘Da’ The Irish Rep revives Hugh Leonard’s semi-autobiographical comic drama from 1978, a memory play with a spectral turn. As the writer Charlie (an adept Ciaran O’Reilly) sorts through the effects of his dead adoptive father, he’s bothered by a fright of ghosts. There’s plenty of claptrap here, but less psychologizing and sentimentalizing than you might expect. Fine acting, too (2:00). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, 212-375-1110, dr2theatre.com. (Soloski) ★ ‘Every Brilliant Thing’ A charming alternative to “It’s a Wonderful Life” as a seasonal catharsis for those who get weepy in the winter, Duncan Macmillan’s monologue of a play, performed by Jonny Donahoe, describes a boy trying to come up with reasons to live for his suicidal mother. Directed by George Perrin, this ingenious production offers sentimentality without shame (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, 212-868-4444, barrowstreettheatre.com. (Brantley) ‘Everybody Gets Cake!’ The comedy troupe Parallel Exit, whose “Room 17B” at 59e59 Theaters in 2011 was hilarious, is back with a new collection of skits, invoking “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In” with a joke wall. The mix of comic styles leaves the show hard to latch on to, but it has some rewarding moments (1:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Neil Genzlinger) ★ ‘50 Shades! The Musical’ When it comes to potential for satire, E.L. James’s she-porn best seller, “50 Shades of Grey,” seems as easy a target as you could shake a sex toy at. That said, this exuberant takeoff handily delivers the goods, barreling along with a score steeped in show tunes, R&B, gospel and Gilbert and Sullivan, and lyrics packed with references to various practices and orifices. “This is real life; this isn’t a book,” says Ana, the show’s heroine, to her tycoon suitor. “If it was, it would be terrible.” It certainly would. But “50 Shades!” is a musical parody, and a very entertaining one (1:30). Elektra Theater, 300 West 43rd Street, Clinton, 212-352-3101, 50shadesthemusical.com. (Andy Webster) ‘Film Chinois’ This handsomely mounted production from the Pan Asian Repertory Theater, about international romantic and political intrigues in postwar Peking, has the stylings of film noir, but could use more of the coiled cynicism of the genre and fewer of its clichés (1:30). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, panasianrep.org. (Webster) ‘I’m Gonna Pray for You So Hard’ Reed Birney gives a biting performance as an egotistical playwright haranguing his daughter, an aspiring actress well played by Betty Gilpin, in Halley Feiffer’s rather punishing drama about the making (and unmaking) of artists, and family. The taut direction is by Trip Cullman (1:30). Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, 866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Isherwood) ‘iLuminate’ More spectacle than story, “iLuminate” offers technology as its most dazzling star. Conceived, produced and directed by Miral Kotb, a former software engineer, the show employs about a dozen talented, indefatigable young actor-dancers, encased in black suits wired with digitally controlled lights. Performing in total darkness to a score combining hip-hop, jazz and classical influences, they portray the tale of an artist whose magic paintbrush is stolen for evil ends. Much of the action is like a neon comic book, but it does have its magic moments (:55). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, iluminate.com. (Laurel Graeber) ★ ‘Into the Woods’ The Fiasco Theater’s truly enchanting production makes the best case ever for Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s twisting revision of fairy tales à la Grimm. By stripping the show of lavish and literal-minded flourishes, the 11-member ensemble brings out this musical’s full emotional and psychological weight, putting the emphasis on the storytelling as a collective and transporting process (2:40). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley) ★ ‘Let the Right One In’ This exquisitely sad and witty import from the National Theater of Scotland, based on a Swedish horror movie and novel, wrings your heart while scaring the mortal stuffing out of you. John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett have lyrically staged this work, with the uncanny Rebecca Benson as a feral, bloodsucking playmate to a bullied boy mired miserably in adolescence, Cristian Ortega (2:15). St. Ann’s Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, 718-254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Brantley) ‘Nevermore: The Imaginary Life and Mysterious Death of Edgar Allan Poe’ Beautifully stylish and excessively bleak, the new musical by Jonathan Christenson takes the sad facts of Poe’s life and makes them gloomier still. The text, largely sung-through, has a storybook feel. The recorded music borrows from the creepier side of cabaret. But this is a more morose affair. Sepulchral, really. It begins upon a midnight dreary and never lets up (2:20). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, nevermoreshow.com. (Soloski) ★ ‘Rock Bottom’ The fearless, funny Bridget Everett bares it all, and then some, in this cabaret-style show, returning to Joe’s Pub after a short run there in the fall. Sex and booze, and Ms. Everett’s tumultuous experience with both, are prominent themes in this R-rated evening, directed by Scott Wittman and featuring ribald songs by Ms. Everett, Mr. Wittman and his writing partner Marc Shaiman, both of “Hairspray,” as well as Adam Horovitz and Matt Ray (1:35). Joe’s Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, joespub.com. (Isherwood) ‘Sex Tips for Straight Women From a Gay Man’ Matt Murphy’s one-act is a blend of a bachelorette party at Chippendales and the embarrassing midnight show at some tourist trap in Pigalle. It has a talented cast, but it is no “Queer Eye” (1:20). 777 Theater, 777 Eighth Avenue, at 47th Street, 888-841-4111, sextipsplay.com. (Gates) ‘Wiesenthal’ This interesting though occasionally long-winded one-man show (written by and starring Tom Dugan) looks at the life of the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal (1:30). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, wiesenthaltheplay.com. (Jaworowski) ‘Winners’ Maggie Bofill’s domestic comedy is overlong, overindulgent and overstressed, with little sense of stakes or of scale. Still, David Gelles and Arielle Goldman do fine work as the Mackey clan’s kids, and Stephanie Hsu and Curran Connor deserve at least a couple of treats for their work as the clan’s talking pets. Sit. Stay. Encore (2:00)! Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, 866-811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Soloski) ‘The Woodsman’ A reimagining of L. Frank Baum’s world, James Ortiz’s movement piece with puppets tells the Tin Man’s back story — how a regular human came to be a rusting pile of metal in need of a heart. With music by Edward W. Hardy, this largely wordless production by Strangemen & Co. has much to recommend it, and one significant flaw: The storytelling isn’t as clear as it needs to be (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Laura Collins-Hughes) Off Off Broadway ‘Mrs. Mayfield’s Fifth-Grade Class of ’93 20-Year Reunion’ This site-specific, immersive performance, which takes place in a tiny fifth-floor tenement apartment, casts its audience as fellow reunion guests. The plot is clichéd and so are many of the characters. The acting and ad-libbing are variable. But you’d be surprised how little of this matters. Sweet and boisterous, “Mrs. Mayfield’s” feels like an adventure and an event (1:30). Location revealed only to ticket buyers; 646-504-2073, capslocktheatre.com. (Soloski) ‘My Son the Waiter: A Jewish Tragedy’ Brad Zimmerman’s solo show about almost three decades of working in restaurants while not becoming a famous actor and his Jewish mother’s shame is low-key, half-familiar, half-mordant and pretty delicious (1:30). Stage 72, 158 West 72nd Street, Manhattan, 212-868-4444, mysonthewaiter.com. (Gates) Extravaganzas ‘Fuerza Bruta: Wayra’ The latest bit of sensory-overload brand extension from the creators of “De la Guarda” is a shiny, ever-shifting kinetic spectacle bent on disorientation. A high-volume, augmented remix of “Fuerzabruta,” this energetic show is rife with not-especially-impressive acrobatics, throbbing music, many-colored lights and high winds from machines set at storm speed (1:20). Daryl Roth Theater, 20 Union Square East, at 15th Street, 212-239-6200, fuerzabrutanyc.com. (Collins-Hughes) ‘Queen of the Night’ The latest and most lavish of this city’s immersive theater experiments includes cocktails, a meal and a circus-style floor show, in addition to any number of possible intimate, eroticism-tinged (but PG-13) encounters with the comely young cast members. The show is not for those prone to social anxiety, but it’s full of gaudy spectacle, with a fin-de-Bloomberg-era vibe (2:45).
