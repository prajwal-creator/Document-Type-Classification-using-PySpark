Monroe’s first homer of the season was his third hit of the game and third career grand slam. Iván Rodríguez opened the 12th with a single off Kurt Birkins (0-1), the eighth Baltimore pitcher. With two outs, Magglio Ordóñez reached on an infield hit and Carlos Guillén walked before Monroe got his clutch hit on a 1-1 pitch. Wilfredo Ledezma (1-0) allowed one hit in two innings for the win. Detroit starter Justin Verlander gave up three hits in seven scoreless innings. He walked three, hit a batter and struck out five. He has not given up an earned run in 13 innings this season but is 0-0 after two starts.

It was the second game in a three-game series that was moved from Cleveland to Milwaukee after snow showers wiped out the Indians’ four-game series against the Seattle Mariners over the weekend, leaving unplayable conditions at Jacobs Field.

The Athletics scored all of their runs in the first inning, then Chicago’s pitchers shut down the struggling Oakland offense the rest of the way. DEVIL RAYS 6, RANGERS 5 Carlos Peña and Ben Zobrist helped Tampa Bay to a rare road victory. Zobrist hit a solo homer in the first and Peña homered in a four-run third inning for Tampa Bay, just 5-36 on the road since June 30. Michael Young homered twice for the Rangers, who had won four of their previous five games. BLUE JAYS 7, ROYALS 4 Troy Glaus homered and reached base four times, and Aaron Hill had three hits and three runs batted in for host Toronto. Gustavo Chacín (1-0) allowed three runs and five hits in five-plus innings as the Blue Jays won for the fourth time in five games. B. J. Ryan pitched a perfect ninth for his third save in four chances.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

CARDINALS 3, PIRATES 2 Chris Duncan homered off Salomon Torres in the ninth inning to give visiting St. Louis a three-game sweep. The Cardinals are 36-15 against the Pirates since 2004 and have won 31 of their past 40 against their National League Central rivals, but they had not swept a three-game series in PNC Park since 2004.

At 7-1, the Braves are off to their best start since 1995, when they won their only World Series title in Atlanta. Washington fell to 1-8, the franchise’s worst start since the Montreal Expos had the same record through nine games in 1998. The Nationals have been outscored by 61-21 and have yet to score in the first three innings of a game. REDS 3, DIAMONDBACKS 1 Matt Belisle gave up three hits and one run over 6 innings for visiting Cincinnati. BREWERS SWEEP MARLINS Prince Fielder singled in the go-ahead run in the 13th inning, the seventh time he reached base, and visiting Milwaukee beat Florida, 3-2, in the completion of the first suspended game caused by a rules change by Major League Baseball. The game was suspended with the score tied at 2-2 after 10 innings and three rain delays Tuesday night that totaled 1 hour 42 minutes. Before this year, it would have become an official tie game and would have been replayed from the start. But under the new rules, it was picked up where the teams left off. In the second game, Dave Bush (1-1) allowed one run and 10 hits in six innings, and Francisco Cordero pitched the ninth for his third save, second of the day as the Brewers won, 5-2. Sergio Mitre (0-2) allowed four runs and 10 hits in six innings.
