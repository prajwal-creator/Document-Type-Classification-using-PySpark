She receives it from other runners, but not from her family. After her comeback effort in the New York City Marathon yesterday, in which she improved her outlook for the 2004 Olympic marathon trial for women in St. Louis on April 4, Pawalek, 29, of Jacksonville, Fla., hoped she would no longer be considered, as she said, ''the black sheep of my family.'' ''Everybody in my family is against my running,'' she said. ''My mother is Vietnamese, and when we came to the United States, she said it was the land of opportunity and I should be a doctor or a lawyer. She could not believe that I chose athletics as a career.'' Pawalek, who placed seventh in the 2000 Olympic trial marathon and has battled injuries since, ran New York in a designated pacing group led by Deena Drossin Kastor, the American record holder (2 hours 21 minutes 16 seconds). Kastor was enlisted by race officials to help four women run 2:39:59 or better, the ''A'' standard for entry into next year's trial. Women who meet that standard, which can be achieved in any sanctioned marathon, have their expenses paid.

In a second pacing group organized by the race, seven women, led by the 2003 national marathon champion, Sara Wells, attempted the ''B'' standard.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       With temperatures in the 60's and humidity reaching 80 percent, Pawalek was the only one of the 11 women from both groups to post a qualifying time. She had hoped to break 2:40 and was on pace with a halfway split of 1:19:50. But after Drossin finished her pacing assignment at 15.5 miles, Pawalek ran the rest of the race by herself and finished in 2:45:20 for 22nd place among the women, and she was the fifth American woman to finish. Pawalek ran 2:44:06 at New York in 2001 to earn a 2004 trials qualifying time, on the first day of the qualifying period, which will end March 3. She is one of 99 women who have qualified nationwide in a bid for three spots. Among those seeking the ''B'' standard in the Wells pace group, the top finisher was 23-year-old Laura Bloedorn of Rochester, in her marathon debut. A former N.C.A.A. Division III all-American in the 10,000 meters at Carlton College, Bloedorn ran 2:54:43 for 31st place. Pawalek was also a top college runner, winning the N.C.A.A. Division II 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the University of North Florida in 1996. Soon after, Pawalek went into road racing, not medicine or law, and was rebuked by her mother, Linda Nguyen. ''Running doesn't fit into her culture,'' Pawalek said.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address.

The family left Vietnam for the United States in 1975, settling in Wisconsin, when Kim was 1 year old and her sister, Mary, now a nurse, was a newborn. ''We had to get out of Vietnam fast,'' Pawalek said. ''The Communists were bombing Saigon and we barely got away.'' Pawalek's parents divorced when she was 12, and she moved with her mother to Florida. She ran the sprints on the high school track squad before finding her potential in distance running. ''I'm a high-mileage runner,'' she said. ''I like to train 100 miles a week.'' For New York, Pawalek felt very fit and started out in Kastor's shadow. ''Deena was breaking the wind, and I was drafting behind her,'' said Pawalek, whose career best is 2:37:56, run in Minneapolis in 1999. ''She kept saying, 'Relax, we're on pace.' It was a great gesture.'' If Pawalek can regain her form, she could become a contender for an Olympic marathon berth in April. Barely five minutes after finishing, she looked fresh. ''The way I feel right now, it was like jogging,'' she said. Pawalek said she felt her pace was slowed by anti-inflammatory medicine that caused her heart to race. Some subpar efforts, affected by recurrent sciatic nerve injuries, caused her sponsors to drop her. While her mother still needs convincing, Pawalek has support from a 1996 Olympic marathoner, Keith Brantly, who lives with Pawalek and coaches her. But Brantly and Pawalek do not train together. ''Keith hates the pitter-patter of my feet,'' she said. That's not a beat that has endeared her to her mother. Pawalek still hopes she will come to St. Louis to watch her in the Olympic trial. ''That remains to be seen,'' Pawalek said.

She is Kim Pawelek, not Pawalek.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
