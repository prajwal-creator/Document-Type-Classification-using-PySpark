Credit John Gichigi/Getty Images     Marion Jones failed a drug test at the United States track and field championships in June, according to three people briefed on the test results. Only Jones’s A sample has been tested, and if her B sample also tests positive for drugs, Jones would face a two-year suspension. She has been dogged by speculation about drug use for several years, but she had never tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs and had repeatedly denied using them. The people briefed on the results said the substance found in Jones’s urine sample was the blood-booster EPO, which is normally used by endurance athletes, not by sprinters like Jones. The people were granted anonymity because antidoping rules prohibit the release of results until both samples are tested. The news comes weeks after Justin Gatlin, who shares the world record and is the reigning Olympic champion in the 100 meters, admitted that he tested positive for testosterone in April, and the Tour de France winner Floyd Landis was found to have synthetic testosterone in his urine. The results of their A samples were confirmed by positive B samples.

Her agent, Charles Wells, told the meet director only that Jones’s departure was for personal reasons.

But Richard Nichols, one of Jones’s lawyers, said in a statement to Reuters, “It is unfortunate that the integrity and the confidentiality of the testing process may have been breached, but Marion Jones has always been clear, she has never taken performance-enhancing substances, not now, not ever.” He added, “She is always prepared to do whatever it takes to demonstrate that she has never taken performance-enhancing substances.” The positive test on Jones’s A sample has been reported to track and field’s international federation, the I.A.A.F., and USA Track & Field, according to those who were briefed on the results. The test was administered by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, which will also be in charge of the testing of the B sample. “Even if we do have a possible case, we would not have a statement until after the B sample is tested,” Pierre Weiss, the general secretary for the I.A.A.F., said in an interview from the federation’s meeting in Beijing. “The athlete has that right, and there should only be two weeks between the A and the B sample.” I.A.A.F. rules, however, say that the federation is to be notified after the A sample comes up positive and that the athlete should not be allowed to compete until the case is settled.

Officials of USA Track & Field and the United States Olympic Committee also declined to comment. Jones was implicated in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative steroid investigation, but she was never charged. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that her former husband, the shot-putter C. J. Hunter, told the grand jury investigating Balco that Jones had used drugs. Jones also had a relationship with the sprinter Tim Montgomery, who has been barred as a result of grand jury testimony about drug use. Jones and Montgomery have a son.

She was the toast of the track world in 2000 when she won five medals at the Sydney Olympics, including gold medals in the 100 and the 200 meters. But she qualified for only the long jump at the 2004 Athens Games. And in the 4x100 relay Jones and Lauryn Williams botched a handoff, and the United States team did not win a medal. Injuries curtailed her 2005 season, as did several meet directors, including the one in Zurich; they refused to invite her to compete because of the drug suspicions. Jones was making a successful comeback this year. After only a few races, including one at a meet on Randalls Island, Jones won the 100 at the national championships in Indianapolis. She also raced at several European meets this summer, lowering her time in the 100 to 10.91 seconds, her best in nearly five years, at a meet in July in Rome. POWELL TIES WORLD RECORD Asafa Powell of Jamaica equaled the 100-meter world record he shares with Justin Gatlin, 9.77 seconds, at the Weltklasse Golden League meet last night in Zurich. He set the world record June 14, 2005, in Athens. He has tied it twice this year, the first time in June in Gateshead, Britain. Gatlin gained a share of the record in May in Qatar. “If I’m going to continue to run 9.77 for the rest of career, it’s not a bother to me,” Powell said. The United States sprinters Tyson Gay a personal best of (9.84) and Leonard Scott (9.97) finished second and third. (AP)   Joshua Robinson contributed reporting for this article.  Correction: Aug. 23, 2006   A sports article on Saturday about a positive drug test by Marion Jones at the United States track and field championships misstated the only event in which she qualified at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. It was the long jump, not the 4x100-meter relay. (She was chosen as a member of the relay team, an event for which there are no qualifying trials.)
