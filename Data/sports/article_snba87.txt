Fifty players have declared themselves free agents in the first four days of the 15-day filing period. Pat Tabler of the Mets, Gary Carter of San Francisco and Danny Jackson of the World Series champion Cincinnati Reds also filed yesterday. The ranking statistics, compiled by the Elias Sports Bureau and based on statistics from the last two seasons, determine which of the free agents require compensation if they move to new teams. The Oakland Athletics, for example, received five selections before the third round of last June's amateur draft as a result of losing Dave Parker, Storm Davis and Tony Phillips as free agents last year. The Athletics knew that when they traded for McGee on Aug. 29 they faced losing him as a free agent, but they also knew they had a chance of getting two high draft choices if he were a Type A free agent. In the ranking group of American League designated hitters, first basemen and outfielders, McGee is 28th. The first 35 players, or the top 30 percent of the group, are classed as Type A.

Barry Larkin of Cincinnati is rated No. 1, with Smith now third. Cal Ripken Jr. of Baltimore had been the No. 1 shortstop in the American League in five of the previous six rankings, but he fell to third behind Alan Trammell of Detroit and Tony Fernandez of Toronto. Don Mattingly, the Yankees' first baseman, suffered one of the most significant falls. Mattingly was No. 1 in 1985-86-87. However, he slipped to second in 1988 and was tied for second last year. This time he has plummeted to seventh, just a notch ahead of Cecil Fielder of Detroit, who wasn't even in the major leagues last year.

Ranked 34th, he is a Type B free agent, meaning compensation for him would be one draft choice instead of two selections. John Franco, the Mets reliever, cannot be a free agent, but he also was ranked surprisingly low, 14th, two notches below a teammate, Alejandro Pena. Eckersley Tops Relievers Dennis Eckersley of Oakland -- no surprise -- was the No. 1 reliever in the American League for the third straight year while Rob Dibble of Cincinnati was top-ranked in the National. The No. 1 starting pitchers were Dave Stewart of Oakland and Doug Drabek of Pittsburgh. Carlton Fisk of the Chicago White Sox was the top-ranked A.L. catcher for the third straight year, and Mike Greenwell of Boston was the No. 1 outfielder for the second year in a row. Wade Boggs of Boston, despite the lowest batting of his career (.302), regained the No. 1 spot among third basemen, bumping Kelly Gruber of Toronto. Crossroads for Evans Dwight Evans of Boston tied with Parker, now with Milwaukee, as the highest-ranked designated hitter, but Evans learned yesterday he has a new status. The Red Sox decided not to pick up their option on his contract for 1991, buying out the option for $200,000 instead of giving him a $1.3 million salary. The Red Sox issued a statement from Evans, but it not say if the veteran, who turns 39 next week, planned to seek a playing role elsewhere. Evans is eligible to be a free agent and falls in the Type A class, but the Red Sox will apparently release him, meaning he would be an unrestricted free agent, able to sign with a new team with no compensation required.

Boone holds the major league record for games caught (2,225).    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
