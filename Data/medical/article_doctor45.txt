I ask my patients about sexual habits and encourage safe sex because I know that it protects against infection. Doctors ask about gun habits and encourage gun safety because we know that it protects against injury and death. One study found that gun safety improved in 64 percent of patients counseled by their doctors. In clinic, I see patients who lost a loved one to gun violence or who have post-traumatic stress from witnessing or being a victim of gun violence. Some judges say that asking a question about gun safety is a form of treatment. As a doctor, I believe that asking this question is part of my sworn duty. Many of my patients wish that a doctor had asked them sooner about gun safety. WILLIAM B. JORDAN Bronx, Aug, 4, 2014  The writer is president-elect of the National Physicians Alliance.
