The new administration of six men is headed by Robert Helmick, the incumbent, who ran unopposed. Helmick, a lawyer from Des Moines, succeeded Jack Kelly as president upon Kelly's death three weeks after taking office in 1985. Steinbrenner's election had been expected.  The U.S.O.C. did not reveal the vote totals, but several sources said Steinbrenner finished third, behind Michael Lenard, a 1984 Olympian in team handball and now a lawyer in Los Angeles, and William Tutt, a Colorado businessman who had served two previous terms as vice president, starting in 1980. The fourth-place finisher was the only woman in contention for any office, Willye B. White, a five-time Olympian in track and field. Besides Helmick, two others ran unopposed: Charles Foster, a former president of the United States Figure Skating Association, who became secretary, and LeRoy Walker, a former president of The Athletics Congress, the governing body for track and field, who became treasurer.

Helmick Appoints Adviser  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Evie Dennis, an outgoing vice president, said she was upset that the nominating committee had not put forth any women. She said she had been given assurances her name would be placed in nomination. ''All men,'' she said. ''I think it's terrible.'' Shortly after the election, Helmick named Dennis to serve as a special adviser to him. Steinbrenner, the 58-year-old principal owner of the Yankees and a part-owner of the Chicago Bulls basketball team, had increased his visibility within the organization over the last five years, first as as a member of the executive board, representing the public sector, and more recently as the chairman of a committee charged with finding ways to improve the U.S.O.C.'s efficiency and American athletes' performance. Report Due Sunday The committee report, a year-long undertaking, is scheduled to be presented Sunday. Steinbrenner said he was ''very excited'' over his election and looked forward to working with what he described as ''the most dedicated people I have found anywhere.'' He expressed regret that no woman had attained office.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address.

He impressed Helmick, then a vice president, almost immediately by resolving a conflict involving the Junior Olympics and the Amateur Athletic Union. The manner in which Steinbrenner handled the matter surprised Helmick. His perception of Steinbrenner had been shaped, in part, by reports of his sometimes rancorous activities with the Yankees. ''You do certain things certain ways,'' Steinbrenner said. ''Different rhymes for different times. I run the Yankees one way, but this is a little different. This is motherhood, a national thing. You operate the way you have to operate.'' Guidelines for Future By last February, during the winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Helmick demonstrated the degree to which he had been impressed by Steinbrenner's work on the Junior Olympic matter: He named him to serve as chairman of an overview committee whose work is being viewed by many U.S.O.C. officials, including Helmick, as the structural guidelines for the future. Meanwhile, other U.S.O.C. officials were also began to embrace Steinbrenner as Helmick had. In their early deliberations, the 10 members of the nominating committee considered Steinbrenner as a possible successor to Howard Miller, the treasurer. Later, committee members included him on a short list of 15 potential vice presidents that was ultimately pared to the three recommendations who prevailed.   ATHLETES OF THE YEAR NAMED Florence Griffith Joyner, the sprinter who won four medals at the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, and set three world records last year, and Matt Biondi, who won seven Olympic medals in swimming, were honored tonight as the United States Olympic Committee's man and woman of the year.
