Arthur Masuaku, Kostas Mitroglou and Imbrahim Afellay scored for Olympiakos. In the other game in Group A, Carlos Tévez scored twice, his first Champions League goals in five years, to lead Italy’s Juventus to a 2-0 victory at home against Malmo of Sweden. Borussia Dortmund strikers Ciro Immobile and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored the goals in a 2-0 victory against visiting Arsenal. Galatasaray drew, 1-1, at home against Anderlecht in the other Group D game. Steven Gerrard converted a penalty in the third minute of stoppage time as host Liverpool defeated Ludogorets of Hungary, 2-1, after a frantic finish. Dani Abalo’s goal for Ludogorets in the opening seconds of injury time had canceled out Mario Balotelli’s 82nd-minute goal — his first for Liverpool. But goalkeeper Milan Borjan took down the substitute Fabio Borini moments later, and Gerrard slotted home the spot kick. In the other Group B game, host Real Madrid opened its title defense with a 5-1 rout of Basel of Switzerland. In Group C, Hulk and Axel Witsel scored to give Zenit St. Petersburg a 2-0 away win in Lisbon against Benfica, which was playing with 10 men, and host Monaco beat Bayer Leverkusen, 1-0. ■ Clint Dempsey and Obafemi Martins led the Seattle Sounders to their fourth U.S. Open Cup title, scoring in overtime in a 3-1 victory over the Philadelphia Union. Dempsey scored in the 101st minute on left-footed blast off Martins’s feed. Martins scored on a breakaway in the 114th minute.
