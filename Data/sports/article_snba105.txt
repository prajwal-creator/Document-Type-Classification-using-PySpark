A BIT HESITANTLY, A dozen Northwestern University players took to the court on their first day of organized practice for the coming Big Ten college basketball season. It was also the first day they would work with a new head coach. In gray slacks and an ''NU''-purple sweater, Bill Foster strode confidently onto the shiny floor and blew a whistle sharply. ''All right!'' he yelled, ''Let's go!'' From nowhere, assistants emerged, with whistles and loud voices. ''Come on! Move!'' they shouted. The young men plunged into rigorous drills and exercises: skipping, dribbling, shooting, passing and running - sideways, forward, backward. Assistants stood with stopwatches and clipboards. When one player tumbled to the floor during a scrimmage, a coach yelled, ''How long you gonna lay there? There's a game going on.''

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       High up in the rafters, two cameras silently recorded every move below. For the fifth time in a quarter-century, and on five different campuses, Bill Foster was starting to rebuild another battered basketball program - which includes everything from recruiting to overseeing practice sessions and coaching during games - an intricate, exhausting process this troubleshooter clearly enjoys. At Rutgers, Utah, Duke and South Carolina, Foster, a 56-year-old self-described basketball junkie who likes country and western music, had installed his outgoing, aggressive, quick style of play and turned losers into winners. The Pennsylvania native was the first coach to win at least 20 games a season at four different Division I schools, those ranked by the National Collegiate Athletic Association as giving the most athletic scholarships. He says, ''Each job was a step up. Each time you're a success somewhere, you're sought more by others elsewhere. I didn't apply for those jobs.'' What makes Foster stand out even more is that, while compiling nearly a .600 career winning percentage over 26 years and some 700 games, he has also stressed academics. A college coach who gives his players one day off a week, always a weekday so they can consult with professors? A coach who does this and still wins consistently enough to command respect and financial support for his program from alumni and from the sale of television and radio rights to games? Television and ticket income from high-profile, multimillion-dollar sports programs, such as basketball and football, can pay for all other school sports. Last year, Big Ten schools, including the nine that did not go to the Rose Bowl, divided up $5.8 million from that single contest. The four finalists in the last N.C.A.A. basketball tournament took home $892,000 each. And on Jan. 2, the Fiesta Bowl football teams - Penn State and the University of Miami - each received $2.4 million for their three-hour, prime-time clash, which was viewed by millions of car buyers and beer drinkers. No surprise, then, that during their last two or three years of high school, star teen-age athletes are wooed by colleges and universities dangling trips, visits, promises of television exposure, a free higher education and, who knows, maybe even a professional athletic career after graduation. The rub is that, in some college sports programs, less than half the athletes actually graduate. A national debate over these developments has simmered for years. Now concern for restoring a balance seems to be mounting in many quarters, including the N.C.A.A., which this year imposed tougher academic requirements for incoming freshmen to be eligible for intercollegiate sports. N O CHALLENGE FOR Coach Foster has ever been greater than forging a winner out of Northwestern's basketball team, which has never been one. It isn't rebuilding; it's starting from scratch. And he must do it within the Big Ten, the nation's oldest collegiate athletic conference and arguably the country's most competitive in basketball, having produced three of the 10 top-ranked teams in a late-season poll this year. Northwestern, with campuses in suburban Evanston and downtown Chicago, has long been respected for its academic standards. And although the school fielded some powerful football teams in the 1940's and 1960's, the 136-year-old institution is a chronic target of jokes as a perpetual bigtime sports loser - and the holder of the all-time college-football losing streak of 34 games.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Last season, Northwestern's basketball team lost 20 games and won only eight, including a forfeit. Worse, in last year's 18 Big Ten Conference games, Northwestern won only twice. Until Foster's arrival, the school had lost 36 of its last 40 Big Ten games. With less than a month to play in this rebuilding season, the Wildcats had won 6 of 23 games, with a 1-12 won-lost conference record. Foremost among the reasons for this poor showing is that Northwestern is the smallest school in a Midwestern conference of very large state universities. Northwestern's undergraduate student body of 7,500, for instance, is barely one-third the size of its intrastate rival, Illinois. And with the cost of one year at Northwestern, the Big Ten's only private university, passing $16,000 this year, athletic scholarships cost the school far more than they do state-run competitors. ''We do not insist that all student athletes be potential Nobel laureates,'' says Northwestern's president, Arnold R. Weber, ''but we do insist that there is more than a reasonable probability that they will benefit from our educational offerings and that they will graduate.'' More than 90 percent of the school's athletes do receive a diploma. In basketball and football, the graduation rate is 100 percent. ''We're committed to trying to build a winning program here,'' says Dr. Weber, ''but you've got to be forever on the alert for potential abuses.'' A strong faculty committee oversees the university's athletic program, setting and regulating practice times, forbidding games during or near exam week, setting academic requirements for athletic eligibility higher than the N.C.A.A.'s, thus insuring compliance with that body's regulations regarding recruiting, often the source of publicized violations elsewhere. According to David Berst of the N.C.A.A.'s division of enforcement, in that division's 35-year history, Northwestern is one of only several Division I schools in the country never to have incurred a penalty for rules violations. Entrance requirements are set by the admissions office, not the athletic director. According to Doug Single, Northwestern's athletic director, the mean grade-point average for entering football players is only a little less than that for all entering freshmen. G IVEN ITS ACA-demic excellence and its athletic mediocrity, Northwestern explored the possibility a few years ago of entering the Ivy League. ''But let's face it,'' said Dr. Weber, ''we're a major Midwestern institution and it generates a lot more interest to play Indiana than, say, Brown or Cornell.'' The Ivy League's enthusiasm was not exactly overwhelming either, especially when even a rebuilding Northwestern football team can thump Princeton, as it did last fall, 37-0. Much of Northwestern's athletic rebuilding efforts in recent times have centered on the two most visible collegiate sports, football and basketball. An integral part of that rebuilding was the selection by athletic director Single of Bill Foster last spring. ''Bill knows we want to win as much as anyone in the conference,'' said Single, who played football and helped administer athletics at Stanford University, another school noted for academic emphasis, ''but we are simply not going to do it at the expense of attracting student-athletes who don't belong in this academic institution.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Since Northwestern is a private institution, it need not reveal the expense of luring Foster. But Single has said that Foster's university income is on a par with other Big Ten coaches, which would put it in the $65,000- to $100,000-a-year range. Most big-time coaches, though, pick up a generous sum from shoe endorsements, television shows and camps. Before Foster actually picked up the reins, a close associate described how the Wildcats' new coach could be expected to proceed. ''The first thing he'll do,'' said Bob Wenzel, basketball coach at Jacksonville (Fla.) University, ''is name an all-new staff who know about winning.'' Wenzel played for Foster at Rutgers, although not on the new coach's first team, which won 5 and lost 17 in 1963. The second season, it went 12-12. The third, 17-7, and the fourth, 22-7. Then, Wenzel was Foster's assistant coach at Utah, where in three years the team's record went from 13-12 to 22-8. He then worked for Foster at Duke, where, under the coach's direction, the team went from 13-13 the first year to 27-7 the fourth, finishing second in the N.C.A.A. tournament, and with Foster being named coach of the year in 1978. ''Next,'' Wenzel predicted, ''he'll get very involved with the recruiting and the campus community. He's a workaholic with infectious enthusiasm. He'll speak to any group, using a lot of self-deprecating humor and urging them to see the games. He'll get to know the faculty. He'll pass out all kinds of articles giving pointers to the players, and above all stressing pride and self-confidence. He'll get to know every high school coach he can find. He'll talk with recruits and their parents about the importance of a college degree, his college's degree, and he'll bring a film of team highlights. ''His recruits will be good players and good kids, the wholesome type. He likes the intelligent ones because they learn more, faster. He'll make the team run a lot and hustle and believe that they can finally win. And even in his first year, Bill's players will upset some teams no one thought they could beat. He's perfect for Northwestern. Oh, and he'll make sure the student cheering section is right behind his bench.'' The first thing Foster did at Northwestern (after acquiring a purple sweater and a purple watch) was recruit a new staff, right down to the secretaries, who were told to answer the phone enthusiastically, ''Wildcat basketball!'' As assistant coaches, he named Jim Brewer, a former player on the championship United States Olympic and Los Angeles Laker teams; Bill Donlon, an experienced coaching assistant from Providence College's winning program, and Paul Swanson, former assistant coach at the University of Northern Iowa. Last summer, Foster sent out a stream of letters to his 13 players, all on athletic scholarships; the letters were accompanied by sports articles, statistics to beat next year and inspirational quotes from the motivational tapes the coach carries in his car. Example: ''Good things cometh to he who waiteth if he worketh like heck while he waiteth.'' He also met with Single. ''Bill wanted the student cheering section moved down behind the bench,'' said the athletic director. Suddenly, Northwestern announced that student ticket prices were being reduced and shuttle buses would run from campus to the distant gym. ''Yes, I was pleased to hear they did that,'' said Foster. The 6-foot-3 Foster, all garrulous and interested, turned up at numerous high school basketball camps all spring and summer. ''We never saw anyone from Northwestern much before,'' said one surprised suburban Chicago coach. Then Foster announced that Northwestern would run its own camp for high school players next summer.

Besides the schedule, the cards carry a little blurb about Foster's coaching record and a picture of a wildcat and Foster under the heading: ''A Different Breed of Cat.'' Foster is always inviting everyone to the games. ''We're going to have buses this year,'' he said, ''In fact, I'll be driving one of them.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It's possible. Foster is a detail man who wants to make every minute count, sometimes twice. If he's exercising on a rowing machine at home, his wife, Shirley, knows a nearby tape machine will be on also, showing past games of schools Foster's team will face soon. If he has five minutes between office appointments, Foster will be on the phone to chat with a sports reporter somewhere, most likely as he simultaneously watches another tape. He wanted a special videotape made for recruiting visits, something that showed Northwestern's beautiful lakefront campus and some women on it, some exciting game footage with rock music, and talk about the curriculum and value of Northwestern's degree. The coach made sure the narration included a pointed reference to how demanding Northwestern University is academically. Some wondered if that might frighten some potential recruits. ''I want people who like to be challenged,'' Foster replied. Early on, Foster phoned other basketball coaches just to chat and get their impressions of past Wildcat teams. One common thought: Northwestern was not fast, didn't seem to like to run. Soon afterward, Foster's assistants and players got a new rigorous - and required - physical conditioning program involving timed runs of one, two and three miles. Those players who don't meet minimum requirements run again, at night and on weekends. Right off, the players picked up on the coach's personal concern, even before Mrs. Foster baked her family-famous lasagna for a preseason team dinner. ''He's very demanding,'' said Shon Morris, a 6-10 junior, ''You always know what he wants and where you stand. But he's very fair.'' Foster or his staff usually have two private coaching sessions each week with each player. They picked up on another concern, too. ''Well, hello, scholar,'' said the coach on one of his evening strolls around campus, ''Going to the library?'' Don Polite, a 6-6 freshman forward, pointed to his armload of books and nodded. ''Good man,'' said Foster, ''Don't let me keep you.'' A CTUAL RECRUIT-ing began last spring, when Foster's new staff pored over lists of the best 3,000 or so high school players, then began contacting coaches and guidance counselors checking academic and disciplinary records. While the pool of talent is large, the pool of talent with good academic records is not. Doug Single estimates that only 15 to 20 of the top 100 high school basketball players meet Northwestern's admission requirements. And competition for those few good students is increasing. This year, a new N.C.A.A. rule, Proposal 48, sets minimum grades for a high school core curriculum as well as minimum scores on college entrance examinations that must be met before college freshmen can play for their new schools. At least three Big Ten schools have lost players for one year who did not meet that qualification, and Foster and Dr. Weber say it has caused more colleges to look more closely at players with good grades, as Northwestern had long been doing.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   This year, one of them was Don Brotz, a 6-5 forward from Long Beach, Calif., who averaged 21 points per game and generally ranked among the nation's top 200 players. He was one of more than two-dozen prospects visited by Foster and numerous other coaches in the hectic six-week autumn recruiting season permitted under N.C.A.A. rules. Brotz's coach had already been phoned and written. Foster was impressed with Brotz. ''I look at the I.Q.,'' he says, ''and then I look at the E.Q., the Energy Quotient. How hard does he want to work? He works hard.'' Foster told Brotz and his mother about Northwestern, the basketball program, the academics and himself. ''I sell a deferred benefit,'' said the coach. ''The degree with an unlimited future.'' The recruit already knew Foster's reputation for rebuilding, and part of Northwestern's appeal was that there was more opportunity to play a significant role there as a freshman than at other schools. In the 10-day November signing period, Brotz opted for Northwestern, Foster's first recruiting coup. Another name was Larry Gorman, a 6-8 forward-center from suburban Chicago and considered among the top 100 high school players. Sixteen different college coaches visited his home. Fifteen of them were excited, enthusiastic and certain he would be a college star. Gorman called them ''hyper.'' The 16th coach was enthusiastic, but calm. He said he could only promise Larry ''a great education and an opportunity to play if you really work for it.'' That was Bill Foster. ''I didn't know anything about Northwestern,'' said the high school senior. ''I had never thought of going there. I only have a B-minus average.'' Gorman visited three university campuses -Akron, Iowa State and Northwestern, despite feeling intimidated by its academic reputation. When Gorman announced that he would sign with Iowa State, the other schools -and Iowa State - turned their attention elsewhere. Not Foster. ''Yes,'' the coach inquired, ''but did he actually sign yet?'' The answer was no. Soon the player's phone rang. It was a graduate of Gorman's high school now at Northwestern. He just wanted to assure his friend that he could make it academically there, if he worked hard. And a few days later, impressed by the continued interest from Northwestern, Gorman signed with the Wildcats. ''It was like Coach Foster was challenging me to become better,'' said the new recruit. ''He said I'd have to work hard, in school and later in life.'' These two players' names will now be used to encourage three more talented prospects to commit to Northwestern during this coming spring's signing period.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''Recruiting goes slowly at first,'' Foster told a small crowd of Northwestern students at an informal dorm meeting one evening. ''You're only recruiting a small percentage of the top players. But a certain percentage of them are looking to combine athletics and academics. And if you can find that fit a few times, you start winning more and then it's bandwagon time, folks. That's when it's fun. I'm looking forward to the day we have crowd-control problems at Northwestern basketball games.'' Foster's enthusiasm and his characteristic up-tempo, aggressive playing, with a pro-style running game and pressing defenses, have excited Northwestern, where ticket sales are up sharply. To broaden the exposure, he invited more than a hundred high school coaches to watch his team work out. Foster also plans intersquad scrimmages at area high schools. ''It's public relations,'' he explains. It also boosts his players' egos, previously overlooked. Then on Oct. 15, the first day of N.C.A.A. practice, a strange thing happened in Northwestern's gym. A local television news crew showed up to film the practice of the worst team in the Big Ten -and to interview its famous coach. An even stranger thing happened in Northwestern's first game under Coach Foster, an energetic exhibition matchup against Marathon Oil, an amateur squad. With an unusual display of energy and confidence, Northwestern won. Had the coach told the players anything special before the game? ''I just said that we are building a winning tradition,'' said Foster, ''and it starts right here, today.'' Some players have started to believe. In fact, their uncharacteristic aggressiveness won half of their first 10 games, including a stunning upset of previously unbeaten Marquette. The new Northwestern coach is realistic about suddenly turning a contender around in the competitive Big Ten. Indeed, he lost seven conference games before beating Michigan State. ''The problem is,'' he says with a well-timed pause, ''there are nine other teams. We're not the quickest guys around. Sometimes, we're just overmatched. We'll need some breaks. We'll be tested every game. And sometimes, you've got to be a pretty good cheerleader.'' He is reminded of the 1982 game, when his South Carolina team was playing a tough Purdue outfit and Coach Foster suffered a heart attack that eventually led to quadruple bypass surgery. The determined, now healthy coach stayed on the sidelines with his team until the final buzzer that painful night. What, someone asked him, was the eventual outcome of that difficult contest? ''Uh,'' says Coach Foster, pretending to try to remember, ''we won.''   Andrew H. Malcolm is chief of the Chicago bureau of The New York Times.
