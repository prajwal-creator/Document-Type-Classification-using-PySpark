But perhaps not since that unabashed duffer Dwight D. Eisenhower has there been such a golfing President as Bill Clinton. By the end of his three-week vacation last week, Mr. Clinton had logged more than 70 hours on the greens, including several sandwiched between the commemoration of World War II in Hawaii and budget politicking in California. Between two days of appearances in Monterey and Fresno, he lived along the seaside links of Pebble Beach. Hillary Rodham Clinton seemed conflicted about Mr. Clinton's addiction. For his 49th birthday, she indulged him with a surprise present: Johnny Miller, the golf pro, to round out a foursome. But on the Clintons' last evening vacationing in Wyoming, the First Lady sounded a tad like a golf widow. At a ceremony at the Jackson Hole Golf and Tennis Club, Mrs. Clinton called it appropriate "to end as we are tonight, on this sacred spot on a putting green." Mr. Clinton, reddening, said with a grin, "That's the last time I'm going to introduce you."  Transported Indeed   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But Mrs. Clinton sailed on serenely. "Thankfully, we were able to be here in a place that inspired me," she said, "and that led me to be transported into the realm of golf, which, you know, I've tried mightily to achieve but never in fact have done so."  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As far back as college, Mr. Clinton was known as a middling hacker (he usually shoots in the mid-80's). And when he became President, he avoided Camp David because he couldn't find nearby links. Erskine B. Bowles, a deputy chief of staff and frequent golf partner of Mr. Clinton's, said practicing putts helps the President concentrate. "The President will go out there by himself and just think and reflect and organize his thoughts," he said. At the White House, where the Eisenhower putting green next to the Rose Garden was recently renovated, aides have become accustomed to seeing Mr. Clinton on the South Lawn taking chip shots toward the putting green. One summer afternoon, members of the National Security Council followed him out to the putting green to finish a discussion of Bosnia. Like all things involving the leader of the free world, even a round of golf is not so simple, even though no one is likely to object to the President's habit of taking mulligans. And so elaborate rituals have evolved for his golfing excursions. The military aide to the President can sometimes be seen depositing the case that contains the nuclear codes in a golf cart to follow Mr. Clinton from tee to tee. Secret Service agents, casually dressed but unmistakable in their earpieces, stalk the greens. Journalists sometimes get transported in an absurd-looking golf cart motorcade. Luckily for a nation that has had to adjust to seeing the President in jogging shorts, he doesn't favor plus fours. Of course, the sporting life of the President is always replete with symbolism. President Eisenhower's golf obsession portrayed him, at least to his critics, as a member of the complacent bourgeoisie. John F. Kennedy's windswept sails captured the dashing spirit of the New Frontier. Ronald Reagan on horseback looked the formidable American hero, like John Wayne. And George Bush's frenetic schedule of athletics served only to burnish the patrician image he wanted to erase. A Regular Guy So it was that Mr. Clinton's jogging seemed emblematic of the "I-can-live-forever" confidence of the baby boomers. But he has been running less recently because of his allergies. And with an election approaching, maybe his passion for golf will make him look like more of a regular guy. "Golf is the typical suburban game," said Hank Morris, a Democratic political consultant. "Those are the swing voters, not just because they swing a golf club but because they swing back and forth and decide elections."    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
