And therein lies the basis of a growing business, specialty medical clinics for travelers. Seven or eight years ago there were no more than two dozen United States clinics in the International Society of Travel Medicine. Today there are about 300. As a record 52.5 million passengers from the United States flew abroad last year (up from 42 million in 1990), the need for protection for private travelers has soared. At Lahey Hitchcock's travel clinic, Dr. Winnie Ooi, a specialist in tropical medicine, said the number of patients doubled in two years. Dr. Bradley A. Connor, a gastroenterologist and a founding member of the International Society of Travel Medicine, said that business at his Park Avenue office has almost quadrupled in just the past year. Similarly large increases are reported across the country.

''We just can't keep up with the demand.''  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       And increasingly, corporations are sending their outbound employees to these clinics to prevent or treat infectious diseases. Alpha Industries, for one, used to send such employees to a local doctor for immunizations. But now Alpha, a semiconductor manufacturer in Woburn, Mass., is sending them to the Travel and Tropical Clinic at Lahey Hitchcock Medical Center in nearby Burlington. ''Our previous doctor didn't have the hepatitis-B vaccine,'' said Dolores Amirault, Alpha's benefits manager. ''These days, employees need to be sure they have the full range of immunizations.'' Specialists in the field say they are unable to estimate how big the business of travel medicine clinics is, because it is new and many doctors and hospitals treat it as a sideline. Fees at the clinics appear to be in line with those charged by general practitioners. Consultations with Dr. Ooi, for example, usually range from $55 to $70, vaccines from $16 (immune serum globulin) to $158 (rabies IM). The more common hepatitis-A vaccine costs $77. Still, the proliferation of the clinics has raised warning flags. Not every clinic that puts ''travel'' in its name is necessarily reputable, said Dr. Jerome Greenbaum, director of the Kaiser-Permanente Travel Clinic in San Francisco. ''Some are in business to make money giving shots.'' Prof. Mark A. Neckes, chairman of the marketing department at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I., concurs. But before departing for teaching stints in Malaysia, he received advice and treatment at the Travel Medicine Clinic at Miriam Hospital in Providence -- ''the kind of preparation,'' he said, ''that everybody should have who plans to travel to countries where there are serious health risks.''

College students whose parents spent spring break on Florida or Texas beaches are now heading for the jungles of Central America, and many exchange students top off an academic year abroad with far-flung vacations.

Cahill, a professor of tropical medicine at New York University Medical School, ''it's like going back five centuries -- in the way people live, in the food they eat and the water they drink. Those are the travelers most in need of finding out what precautions to take before they go and while they're there.'' Dr. Maria D. Mileno, the director of Miriam Hospital's travel medicine clinic and an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Brown University, tries to familiarize students who will be studying abroad with health risks. ''I tell the kids that rather than drink water that hasn't been boiled,'' she said, ''tell the family you're living with a white lie -- say you have a bowel disorder.'' Need for Protection Soars However broadening, such travels put people increasingly at risk -- not only from accidents and intestinal bugs but from resurgent malaria, yellow fever, cholera, dengue fever, African sleeping sickness and schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease often contracted from contaminated rivers and lakes. Dr. Connor once warned a patient about swimming in fresh water in Africa, because of the risk of getting schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease also known as bilharzia, or snail fever, but he swam anyway. ''Six months later he blacked out while driving in Florida,'' Dr. Connor said. ''After surgery and antibiotics, he still had to be on antiseizure medicine for the next two years.'' Add to the above the recent scares about Ebola virus, mad cow disease, bird flu and, most recently, Rift Valley Fever in Kenya, and it is easy to understand why business is booming at travel medicine clinics -- even if, as is the case with some of those diseases, there are no vaccines and doctors can only explain the risks and counsel caution. Some diseases are as much the result of bad judgment as of bad luck. ''We had a patient in her 70's who was traveling to the Taj Mahal,'' said Ms. Ward of the Scripps Clinic. ''Her bus stopped where there was a traveling carnival that had a bear with no teeth. When the woman posed with the bear it glommed onto her arm, breaking the skin and infecting it with green slime, so she had to have rabies shots.'' To help avoid the more predictable risks, Lahey Hitchcock and other travel medicine clinics administer vaccines and write prescriptions when necessary, and advise patients about everything from coping with jet lag to minimizing their exposure to the flies, mosquitoes and other insects, snails, rodents and unhygienic practices that transmit or cause disease. Reminders are visible throughout Doctor Ooi's examination room on the fourth floor of Lahey Hitchcock's department of internal medicine. Maps of South Asia and South America share wall space with a colored poster of the many malarial regions of southern Africa. Flanking them are bulletins from the World Health Organization in Geneva and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta warning of dengue in Trinidad and Tobago, tick-borne encephalitis in Saudi Arabia, cholera in Kenya and hemorrhagic dengue in Costa Rica.

''One youngster who came through our clinic phoned about a month ago after he got back from India,'' Ms. Ward of Scripps said. ''After he bought and ate food sold on the street, he got sick and had to get antibiotic shots over there. When I told him he should never eat food sold on the street, he said, 'I can't promise that I won't do it again.' And I said, 'Then I can't promise you won't need antibiotics again.'
