The man, John Paggioli, said in his complaint against the school, Poly Prep Country Day School in Bay Ridge, that the coach, Phil Foglietta, molested him on and off school grounds on many occasions between 1970 and 1974, when he attended the school. Lawyers for the school have filed a motion to dismiss the case because the statute of limitations on the sexual abuse charges expired long ago, a deterrent to similar lawsuits against other defendants in the past. But lawyers representing Mr. Paggioli in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn are trying a novel strategy to counter that argument. The suit's allegations are based not on the abuse itself but on what it says were the efforts of school officials to misrepresent and cover up what Mr. Foglietta did. According to the suit, the Bay Ridge school had long known about accusations from other students against Mr. Foglietta, a revered football coach who died in 1998. At a hearing yesterday on the motion to dismiss the suit, Mr. Paggioli's lawyer, Marc J. Fliedner, said the school could not cite the statute of limitations to fight the suit because its fraud, misrepresentations and deception had prevented his client from making a timely accusation.

Mr. Paggioli struggled for years with mental illness and addiction with no memory of the abuse, he said, until 2000 when the memories came back. Information about the other accusations could have helped him in his own treatment and recovery, the lawsuit charges.

"It is to bring a cause of action for the concealment that caused him additional pain, well beyond that which he would have experienced" from the abuse alone. But Jeffrey I. Kohn, a lawyer for the school, disagreed, saying that the relevance of the statute of limitations was well established. "If you look at some recent cases in the past year against a number of other institutions, including churches, nonprofits, schools, the New York law is very, very clear that any kind of claim of repressed memory for so many years" does not supersede the statute of limitations, he said. "There really is no legal remedy at this point."  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address.

Harman, about his abuse after he recalled it in 2000, he did not learn that other former students had made accusations similar to his own until 2002, when Mr. Harman wrote a letter to alumni and parents that suggested officials had only recently learned of the accusations and that only two students had come forward. But according to Mr. Paggioli's documents, Mr. Harman told him that Mr. Foglietta, who was portrayed as a respected faculty member when he left the school after 25 years in 1991, had actually been fired, suggesting that officials had long known about the accusations and that there were more than two reports they considered credible. Among Mr. Paggioli's court papers is a statement from another former student, John Marino, who attended Poly between 1972 and 1976 and contacted Mr. Paggioli and his lawyer after reading news articles about his suit. Mr. Marino said that Mr. Foglietta beat him, and that he saw the coach engage in sexual acts with boys, sometimes in a green Impala parked a block from the school. His statement said that he told his parents, who informed the headmaster at the time, William M. Williams, and Harlow Parker, the director of athletics, both of whom are named in the suit. But school officials portrayed Mr. Marino as an agitator, his statement said, dismissing his claims and taking no action to prevent further abuse. Mr. Kohn said yesterday that he was focused only on the statute of limitations issue and not on the merits of the suit, although he added that the school would deny the allegations if the case went ahead. A ruling is expected in January.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
