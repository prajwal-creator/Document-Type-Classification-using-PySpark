As Thursday dawned, that cry echoed across the land as an astounded citizenry gazed at what it had wrought. Inflation is dead, economists say? Ha! What about gift inflation? You simply can't buy less stuff than you did last year -- not in America, land of the wide-open wallet. (Shame on you for even thinking such a thought!) There are only so many different kinds of stuff, though, so the stuff makers have to constantly dream up new, even more outlandish goodies. You probably didn't know, for instance, that your dog was pining for a set of ''doggie bandannas'' -- one for each of various holidays. So on the day after, when there's stuff under your every foot, the shopping ordeal must be followed by a truly cruel and unusual ordeal: schlepping to the stores, again, to return unwanted stuff. By some estimates, 10 percent of gifts are returned. No one has been brave enough to estimate how many gifts are put in attics ''for now.'' YEAR-END BONUSES It's a Wonderful Life (Really) Talk about split personalities! We let out a collective cheer when Alastair Sim, as Scrooge, dances a jig to his new-found charitable urges. We weep in joy when Jimmy Stewart, as George Bailey, is bailed out by his neighbors. Yet in real life, Scrooge Inc. -- better known as corporate America -- writes $90 million checks to people like Michael Ovitz, while sending the Bob Cratchits nothing but greeting cards embossed with cloying poetry. Exceptions crop up, though, and here's a whopper. A California company called Kingston Technology got a $1 billion windfall recently, and, sticking to a commitment to give 10 percent of profits to employees, it's putting $100 million into bonuses for all. Part of that will be deferred, but that still leaves $75,000 for an average worker. And it's no fable. APPLE COMPUTER Return of a Wandering Genius Any self-respecting culture has its legends, epic stories you simply don't mess with, and the computer industry is no exception. One biggie: the tale of Steve Jobs, the blazing visionary who ignited a revolution at Apple Computer, then blasted off in new directions as Apple hit corporate middle age. Could Mr. Jobs return to Apple? Absurd. It would be like Robin Hood becoming chief financial officer at Nottingham Arrows Inc. Scrap that legend, though: Apple, in search of a new operating system, just bought Next Software -- run by, yes, Mr. Jobs. And Apple is clearly in need of any second childhood its founding father might help create. HEALTH CARE Last, Heal Thy Bottom Line Ever since H.M.O.'s appeared, a debate has raged over whether health care can be treated like any other industry. The question, basically, is whether the ''bottom line'' has a dollar sign on it or a beating heart. In the first rush to profits, some managed-care plans offered bonuses to doctors for keeping the cost of services down, but worries quickly grew that patients were being denied needed care just so the numbers would look good. The Federal Government has decided that such an approach is unacceptable, last week adopting a policy limiting those bonuses. The new policy applies only to Medicare and Medicaid, but it is expected to set a standard for the industry.

''It's great,'' they'd say, sounding as if they'd just stepped out of one of those fuzzy ''best places to live'' magazine articles. But then, a look of true agony distorting their faces, they'd add: ''If I could only find a decent bagel.'' It's a good line, but like many good lines, it just isn't true any more. In case you hadn't noticed, bagels are everywhere. Einstein/Noah has grown to 300 stores, Bruegger's to 450. Kellogg just paid a mint for Lender's Bagels, and Dunkin' Donuts added bagels this summer. According to the American Bagel Association -- yes, there is such a thing -- bagel sales have grown fivefold in just three years. And one research firm -- yes, they're watching you -- says bagels figure in 3.5 percent of breakfasts at home.

Those two little words have such a comforting, safe-as-houses ring to them, don't they? ''Play it safe,'' you hear. ''Put it in mutual funds.'' Or: ''Invest for retirement -- in mutual funds.'' This country seems to be turning into one giant mutual fund. According to a recent survey, 37 percent of households invest in mutual funds, up from 31 percent two years ago. In 1988, just 10 percent of 401(k) money was in mutual funds; that mushroomed to 39 percent last year. Is this a giant, and quite shaky, house of cards? That's what some people are warning. Because if this stock market ever decides to take a breather, and investors who are hooked on 12 to 15 percent returns, year after year, face the unthinkable -- fund losses -- it might all come crashing down. Or, of course, it might not. LABOR RELATIONS Let Them Eat Popcorn In most strikes, issues like free popcorn and free breakfasts would never come up. But strikes by the United Auto Workers against Caterpillar have seemed more the rule than the exception lately, with the most recent one ending a year ago after 17 months. So the little things add up. Over the years, Caterpillar gave nonstriking workers all sorts of goodies, from unlimited ice cream and popcorn to flu shots. And last week the National Labor Relations Board said that this discriminated against striking workers, and that they had to be compensated. No estimate was given of the value of these perks, though presumably 17 months' worth of ice cream and popcorn will not be plunked onto workers' porches -- and it's too late for last year's flu shot. But whatever the amount, Caterpillar complained that the labor board was going to ''ridiculous lengths to support the U.A.W.'s harassment tactics against Caterpillar.''

Stay Tuned Ask most younger working people about Social Security and you'll get a cynical snicker and some comment like ''I'll never see a penny of it.'' Never fear: Even as we speak, a high-level Federal panel is on the case. (All Federal panels are ''high-level''; ''low-level'' panels are as rare as Fed Ex letters that aren't ''Urgent.'') In fact, the panel has been on the case for two and a half long years, groping for ways to pull more money out of the hat when the thing goes bust in 15 or 20 years. The debate seems to be this: Do we tinker with the system but leave it pretty much intact, or do we transform it into a public-private hybrid, forcing people to save more themselves? The radical approach has drawn fire from those who say it would worsen the split between ''haves'' and ''have nots.'' But here's the amazing news: the panel is about to issue its report, possibly as early as tomorrow. In the meantime, keep worrying.
