Now, the findings of recent investigations into the validity of traditional herbal remedies indicate that our ancestors had the right idea, if not the best way to administer it. Two psychologists have reported in the British medical journal, The Lancet, that capsules of powdered ginger root were twice as effective as Dramamine in warding off motion sickness. The study, conducted by Daniel B. Mowrey of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and Dennis E. Clayson of Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, involved 36 college students who said they were highly susceptible to motion sickness. About 20 minutes before the actual test, each was given either Dramamine (100 milligrams), two capsules of powdered ginger (940 milligrams in all), or two capsules of powdered chickweed, which served as a placebo control in the study. Then the students were spun in a motorized chair for up to six minutes while their symptoms of motion sickness were recorded.  The rotation was stopped if the student vomited or asked to stop. None who had taken the placebo or the Dramamine lasted the whole six minutes, whereas half who had taken ginger stayed the full time.  The study showed that it took roughly twice as long for those who took the ginger to become as sick as those who took Dramamine. The chickweed gave no apparent benefit. The researchers emphasized that ginger root must be taken in capsules to avoid severe irritating effects. Capsules of powdered ginger root can be purchased in health-food stores, Dr. Clayson said. He recommended taking two or three capsules to prevent motion sickness. Dr. Mowrey said his studies have also shown that the herb can counter the diarrhea and vomiting of gastrointestinal ''flu.'' The effective dosage seems to vary from person to person, with some taking as many as 10 or 12 capsules an hour. Unlike Dramamine, the ginger root produces no sedation or other effects on the central nervous system. The herb appears to act entirely in the gastrointestinal tract, absorbing toxins and restoring normal gastric activity, Dr. Mowrey said. Excessive doses, however, may irritate the upper digestive tract.    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
