The court divided 5 to 4 on a question that is growing in importance as governments spin off various functions to the private sector: where to draw the line between truly private organizations and ''state actors,'' to which the full range of constitutional commands applies. At issue in the case was a private high school's First Amendment lawsuit against the group, the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association, challenging a recruiting regulation as an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. Since the Constitution places limits on the behavior only of government, not of private entities, the suit could proceed only if the association was a ''state actor.'' Writing for the majority today, Justice David H. Souter said there was no one formula for separating public from private. But in this case, he said, ''the nominally private character of the association is overborne by the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and workings, and there is no substantial reason to claim unfairness in applying constitutional standards to it.''

Justice Thomas said the doctrine ''was developed to reach only those actions that are truly attributable to the state'' and ''not to subject private citizens to the control of federal courts.''  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The majority opinion, Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association, No. 99-901, was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist signed the dissenting opinion, as did Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. The debate over when to attribute governmental functions to a nominally private organization is an old one at the court. During the 1950's and 60's, for example, state and local governments in the South tried to avoid racial integration by turning over to private organizations public sites like parks and swimming pools, and even the function of nominating candidates for political office. Justice Souter today cited a 1966 decision, Evans v. Newton, in which the Supreme Court held that private trustees to which the City of Macon, Ga., had transferred a park were state actors who could not escape the reach of the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection. The issue has come up more recently in the context of athletics. In 1988, the court rejected the claim that the National Collegiate Athletic Association was a state actor but suggested that interscholastic athletic associations operating completely within one state might be. After that ruling, athletes and member schools began to bring various kinds of constitutional lawsuits against state athletic associations. Every federal appeals court to consider the question had found state athletic associations to be state actors, with the sole exception of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati, which rejected the claim in the case today. In its 1999 decision, the Sixth Circuit overturned an earlier ruling by the Federal District Court in Nashville that the Tennessee association had violated the First Amendment rights of Brentwood Academy, a football powerhouse that had been found in violation of the association's recruiting rules, which barred coaches from communicating with prospective students.

As the state-action issue began to be litigated, the formal designation was dropped and the association's role, while substantively still the same, became informal. ''The most one can say on the evidence is that the state board once freely acknowledged the association's official character but now does it by winks and nods,'' Justice Souter said today.

Justice Souter noted that public schools made up 84 percent of the association's membership and that public school officials ''do not merely control but overwhelmingly perform'' the association's most important functions. There were also these developments today as the court returned from a monthlong recess: Wolf Protection Without comment, the court turned down a constitutional challenge to an Endangered Species Act regulation intended to protect endangered red wolves. The justices' action saved Theodore B. Olson, the lawyer for two North Carolina landowners and two North Carolina counties that were challenging the regulation, from a potentially awkward situation. President Bush nominated Mr. Olson last week to be solicitor general, the government's top lawyer in the Supreme Court, and the solicitor general's office had already filed a brief at the court defending the same regulation that Mr. Olson was attacking. At issue in the case, Gibbs v. Norton, No. 00-844, was a regulation issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1987 to prohibit people from injuring red wolves found on their property. These wolves, considered among the most endangered mammals in North America, have been bred in captivity under a federal program and released to the wild in five North Carolina counties. The lawsuit argued that the regulation exceeded the federal government's power to regulate interstate commerce because the prohibited conduct was private, noncommercial and intrastate. Plant Patents The court agreed to decide whether plant seeds may be patented under federal law. The case, J. E. M. AG Supply Inc. v. Pioneer-Hi-Bred International Inc., No. 99-1996, is likely to attract considerable attention, because the Supreme Court rarely takes patent cases. In a landmark case in 1980, the court ruled that federal patent law protected bioengineered bacteria. The new case concerns patents on 17 varieties of corn held by Pioneer Hi-Bred, a subsidiary of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company and the world's largest producer of seed corn. Pioneer Hi-Bred sued J.E.M. AG Supply for patent infringement for selling its seed corn without authorization. In a countersuit, J.E.M. contended that the patents were invalid, arguing that federal law did not provide for patents on sexually reproduced plants, as opposed to those that are produced by grafting or budding from a single parent.
