Credit Jon Tonks for The New York Times       The Fugitive  His feet froze solid. An avalanche buried him up to his neck. Villagers risked death to hide him. How Jan Baalsrud escaped the Nazis and became a Norwegian folk hero.   By ROBERT KOLKER MARCH 16, 2016          T he young soldier was frightened and freezing. He’d just swum 70 yards through frigid water, fleeing the burning wreckage of an exploded boat. Climbing ashore, he heard gunfire, glanced backward and saw his friend on the ground, blood rushing from his head. Farther away, others in his unit were being rounded up or killed by the Germans. He was sure he would be next. He ran. He heard more gunfire. He spotted a gully, a long, lightning-shaped sliver in the snowy hillside, and climbed into it, taking cover behind a large rock. As he watched four soldiers climbing toward him, he took stock. He was alone, trapped in enemy-controlled territory. His soaked uniform was crystallizing, hardening into a shell of ice. He had just one boot, having lost the other in the water. He had no map, no food, no water and no plan. He did, however, have a gun: a small Colt, still snapped in its holster. From behind the rock, he saw the soldiers getting closer, within range. He aimed and pulled the trigger. The gun jammed. He kept trying; it kept jamming. He yanked out the magazine and tossed out the first two rounds. Then he fired again, twice. One soldier threw up his arms and dropped to the ground, dead; another fell wounded. The others drew back, buying him time. He turned up toward the hill, planted one bootless foot in the snow and ran.

Their fishing boat, the Brattholm, carried a secret cargo of bombs and explosive devices. Baalsrud was a 25-year-old son of an instrument maker who escaped his country after the German invasion in 1940 and returned three years later as a saboteur. He joined Linge Company, a group of young Norwegians who trained with the Allies in special ops and then sailed back on stealth missions, across the North Sea from Shetland, Scotland, and into occupied Norway, using the maze of fjords as cover. Their mission that March was to establish a presence near the northern port city Tromso, where they would sabotage anything the Germans were using to fortify the Axis troops on the Russian front. Baalsrud’s assignment was to swim underwater and fasten some of the explosive devices — limpets, or magnetic bombs — to seaplanes in order to sink them.

Stranded at "Hotel Savoy"  5. Amputates toes in Skaidijonni Cave  6. Crosses to safety               Small efforts like these, put together, made history. Winston Churchill had always maintained that control of the North Sea would be essential to any Allied victory. This particular effort, however, was a complete failure. Someone in the next village alerted the Germans within a day of the team’s arrival. When Baalsrud spotted German ships moving into the cove, he knew the mission was finished. Their only option was to scuttle the boat. The men lit a fuse, waiting until the last minute to jump before the Brattholm exploded. Baalsrud swam ashore, shot the two German soldiers and then ran, staggered, hobbled, skied and sledded for nine weeks through Norway’s frozen fjords, the target of a nationwide manhunt.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story        What happened over those nine weeks remains one of the wildest, most unfathomable survival stories of World War II. Baalsrud’s feet froze solid. An avalanche buried him up to his neck. He wandered in a snowstorm for three days. He was entombed alive in snow for another four days and abandoned under open skies for five more. Alone for two more weeks in a cave, he used a knife to amputate several of his own frostbitten toes to stop the spread of gangrene. He spent the last several weeks tied on a stretcher, near death, as teams of Norwegian villagers dragged him up and down hills and snowy mountains. By the end, Baalsrud was less a hero than a package in need of safe delivery, out of Nazi hands. For decades, his escape made him into a Norwegian national folk hero, even as the man himself remained frustratingly opaque, almost unknowable. Norway has a mild reputation, now, as a beneficent social democracy, so rich with oil that it’s almost unseemly, its finances largely walled off from the calamities within the European Union. The war and the occupation aren’t prominent parts of the national identity the way they once were; and yet up in the fjords, there are signposts marked with a red letter B that are left unexplained to hikers. They mark a path that begins more than 350 miles inside the Arctic Circle, in the cove called Toftefjord. From there, the route zigzags south 80 miles, up and down mountains and across rivers, concluding at last at the border Norway shares with Sweden and Finland. It remains all but impassable in winter. Two Norwegian commandoes tried it just two years ago; when a storm came, they had to be airlifted out. But in warmer weather, anyone can walk the trail, or most of it. I arrived in Toftefjord on a bright, cool late-summer morning, the sun above the clouds casting stark shadows on still water. It’s a silent, tiny bay, bordered on three sides by stark moss-green outcroppings. The motorboat captain had a location saved on his GPS, and he guided the boat there. His little dog, a brown mutt, ran to the bow, his nose poking over the edge, aiming down. I looked, too. A few feet beneath us, at the bottom of the bay, still lay some of the wreckage of the Brattholm. The captain cut the motor. The quiet was unnerving but not unusual in the fjords, where a tranquil sense of isolation easily coexists with all the intense, momentous visual drama around you: brilliant green and turquoise rivers, as smooth as glass, reflecting the sun so that you can barely see; craggy, sharp-angled, purple-capped mountains erupting straight out of those rivers at right angles. Everywhere you turn and everywhere you look, you’re in both the middle of nowhere and the center of the universe.

Credit Jon Tonks for The New York Times    Guiding us through the fjords was Tore Haug, a distinguished-looking 74-year-old sports-medicine doctor and former commercial pilot who may be one of the last living authorities on Baalsrud’s escape. He met me in Oslo, and together we took a two-hour flight to Tromso, where we got a car and drove along the fjords to the ferry to Rebbenesoya, the island where Toftefjord is. Haug is Baalsrud’s second cousin, but he met the man only once, as a boy; he remembers Baalsrud refusing to talk with his relatives about his wartime experiences. Like his famous relative, Haug is reserved. On our drive, he allowed that he might be drawn to the story less because of the blood connection than because of a certain awe that some men his age often come to feel about those who fought in the war. ‘‘These guys were unspoiled in ’43,’’ Haug told me softly as the motorboat reached the shore. ‘‘Most young people, they don’t know the story.’’ Haug is among the many Norwegians of his generation who grew up on the tale of Baalsrud’s escape. ‘‘We Die Alone,’’ the first book-length account, published in 1955 by the British journalist David Howarth, became an instant classic in Norway. Two years later, a movie based on the book, ‘‘Ni Liv’’ (‘‘Nine Lives’’), was nominated for an Oscar for best foreign film. Not satisfied with these versions of the story, Haug spent several years working on a book of his own. In 2001, he and a co-author, Astrid Karlsen Scott, published ‘‘Defiant Courage,’’ a day-by-day reconstruction of Baalsrud’s story that exhaustively praises the people of the fjords who smuggled him past German patrols, ministered to his frostbitten feet and hid him in lofts, barns and sheds. ‘‘My intention was to honor all his helpers,’’ Haug told me, ‘‘because that was what Jan wanted.’’   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   One of the first of those helpers was waiting for us in Toftefjord, on the porch of a modest green cottage, a short walk from the shore. Dagmar Idrupsen is one of the last people still living who saw Baalsrud during his escape. She was 10 when Baalsrud tore through Toftefjord. When I spoke with her, she was 82 and peppy, if a little bashful. Inside on her kitchen table was an array of food that she had spent the morning preparing for her visitors: hard-boiled eggs and dark goat cheese, jam and bread and cured sausages. To Dagmar and her family, Baalsrud’s escape represents the moment idyllic childhood and World War II collided in the middle of her kitchen. She remembered the sound of machine-gun fire outside her window. She remembered her mother weeping, certain that they needed to surrender or else they would all be killed. Fleeing up the hill, the family heard an explosion — Baalsrud, scuttling the Brattholm — that sent flaming debris flying up in their direction, seemingly following their path. They kept running, to the shore on the east side of the island, and shouted for help. Dagmar’s aunt sent a small boat to fetch them to her own place across the fjord. That was where, later that night, Dagmar’s sister and cousin left the house in the dark and came back with the blue-eyed stranger. Baalsrud was handsome, as Dagmar recalled, her face reddening at the memory. He was also ice-cold and soaking wet, his Norwegian commando uniform frozen solid. He had been bold enough to swim in the same icy waters that they had crossed by boat. He had been running from the same gunfire. Dagmar saw the man’s gun — the snub-nosed Colt — and a shiver of fear ran through her.

Credit Jon Tonks for The New York Times    Everyone in the room understood the danger he was putting them in. If the Germans ever caught this man, he would be tortured, then killed. But the family promised to help him. He seemed grateful and relieved; his sensitivity, along with his courtesy and bravado, was what so many others would remember about him in the decades to come. But this is what Dagmar remembered most: Before he left, the handsome stranger leaned down, looked her squarely in the eye and declared, with stone-cold certainty, that if she ever told a soul that she’d seen him, everyone she loved would almost certainly be killed. Baalsrud knew the fate of Norway didn’t hinge on whether he made it out of the country alive. He wasn’t holding secret information that could win the war; he had no special value to the military. Howarth, in ‘‘We Die Alone,’’ proposed what would, for Baalsrud, be the essential question: ‘‘Was he right, as a soldier, to let women and children put their lives in such terrible danger?’’ Baalsrud settled on a method for minimizing the risks he presented to every new person he met: Never tell anyone who else he saw along the way and never confirm where he would be going next. He headed south, knocking on doors when he was out of strength or in danger of freezing to death, never knowing if the people on the other side of the door would turn him in. None of them did, as Haug and Karlsen Scott recount in their book, and many did more than just offer shelter. There was the midwife who offered to hide him upstairs, disguising him as a woman in labor. (He did not accept the offer.) There was the man who warded off a neighbor known to be on the German payroll who came by while Baalsrud was inside. There was a young girl who was the first to get a close look at Baalsrud’s frostbitten feet and tried to bandage them as best she could. There was the fisherman who outfitted Baalsrud with new boots and a pair of skis. There was the father, still mourning the loss of his young son, who rowed Baalsrud in a dinghy through rocky waters in the middle of the night, avoiding German sentries, to deposit him on another shore. On skis, Baalsrud thought, the rest of the trip would be easy. He even boldly whizzed past a group of German soldiers on their way to breakfast, vanishing from view before they thought to wonder who he was. Then came a blizzard. His eyes frozen shut, gasping for air, he became so disoriented he couldn’t tell if he was ascending or descending. He devised a technique to keep from falling: He threw a snowball, and if he didn’t hear it hit the ground, he went in the other direction. Without realizing it, he was climbing Jaeggevarre, an almost 3,000-foot mountain. But he was all right, more or less, until the avalanche. Baalsrud tumbled some 300 feet down into the valley, destroying his skis and losing his poles and satchel. When he awoke, he was still snow-blind. By his third day wandering alone, he was hallucinating, hearing the voices of the men of the Brattholm he had left behind.  Photo        Are and Kjellaug Gronvoll outside the barn where their family hid Baalsrud in the hayloft.   Credit Jon Tonks for The New York Times    On the fourth day, he found his way to lower ground and a small village called Furuflaten. He saw a house and stumbled inside. This turned out to be Baalsrud’s great stroke of luck. The house belonged to the sister of Marius Gronvoll, an active member of the resistance. A building nearby was a German military headquarters; he just as easily could have barged in there, and his story would have ended.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Instead, in a remarkably coordinated effort, many in the village came together to help harbor the fugitive and get him on his way, all without the Germans noticing. The Gronvoll family stashed Baalsrud in their barn for four days as he tried to recuperate. According to Haug and Karlsen Scott, two German soldiers searched the barn once but walked out before checking the loft where Baalsrud was hiding behind a bed of hay. Slowly, the Gronvolls brought Baalsrud back to life. But the frostbite had taken hold, and Baalsrud was no longer able to walk on his own. Marius recruited three others to help put Baalsrud on a stretcher, sneak him past the Germans into a rowboat and take him across the fjord, pretending to fish the whole time. When the terrain on the other side proved too steep to negotiate with a stretcher, Marius hid Baalsrud in a small shed and returned to Furuflaten, where he convinced a local schoolteacher with carpentry skills to make a sled — no small feat, considering the school was where all the soldiers congregated. The teacher made it in pieces, and it was assembled on the other side of the fjord. Today, Furuflaten is still very small, with about 250 people. Along the main road is a little museum devoted to Baalsrud — really just an alcove inside a community center, a wooden barn-style building with a stage for assemblies and community theater. It’s open only a few days a week, and there is no sign outside to tell anyone that it exists. There are Baalsrud’s wooden skis, recovered by a local resident in the bottom of the valley in the summer of 1943 and hidden until the end of the war. There is Baalsrud’s gun, the snub-nosed Colt, which Baalsrud’s brother had given to a museum near Oslo before it was transported back to Furuflaten. There are four little dioramas, each depicting a scene in Baalsrud’s escape in an almost twee Wes Anderson fashion. And there is a replica of the sled that transported Baalsrud, with a mannequin of Baalsrud himself lying on top. A few feet away is a stuffed fox, with a paper sign hanging around its neck. The message, in Norwegian: ‘‘I saw him, but I didn’t say anything.’’ This is a museum devoted to the successful keeping of a secret. The Gronvoll family’s barn, where Baalsrud, snow-blind and lame, recovered after the avalanche, is still standing just up the road. After the war, Marius married a young woman named Agnete Lanes, who had helped him tend to Baalsrud. They had seven children, three of whom met me at the barn: two sons, Are and Dag, and a daughter, Kjellaug. They are all at least 50 now, decades older than their parents were when Baalsrud came into their lives. Kjellaug still lives in Furuflaten, working as a nurse in a neighboring town. Dag works in the pharmaceutical industry in Tromso. Are, who has an uncanny resemblance to the pictures I saw of his father, works in the local fish-feed industry. Staying silent about helping Baalsrud, keeping the secret, took a toll on the Gronvoll family. In a very real sense, it fractured them. ‘‘My father had two sisters,’’ Are said, ‘‘and he sent them away’’ for the duration of the war. ‘‘If the Germans found out what happened, at least his sisters would survive.’’ Their heroism, like Baalsrud’s, was of an ambiguous kind, and Howarth’s question occurred to me again. Even years after the war — despite the book, the movie and the indomitable legend — some of his neighbors, Are said, still thought of Marius and his family as troublemakers, the ones who had endangered their community, who put everyone at risk.  Slide Show    From Furuflaten, Marius and his three friends had rowed Baalsrud across the fjord to a hamlet called Revdal. A few dozen yards from the shore is a small shed, about 6 by 9 feet, where they left him on a wooden platform, unable to walk, but within reach of food, water, a knife and a bottle of homemade hard liquor. Baalsrud joked to them that it was every bit as nice as the Hotel Savoy. Marius came to visit and meant to come back again, but a storm delayed him for another five days. This was when Baalsrud’s journey took its grimmest turn yet. Sometime during those days, Baalsrud took the knife and cut into several of his toes, hoping to bleed out the frostbite-caused infection that he feared would spread up his legs. He also amputated one of his big toes. On the drive to Revdal, Haug told me that he wanted me to experience the ‘‘Hotel Savoy’’ alone — to leave me there for several minutes in silence so that I could imagine what it must have been like to stay in there, day after day, expecting Marius and his friends to come, but them never coming, to be experiencing incredible pain from gangrene, to start to think that this would be the place where he would die. When we arrived, we almost missed the place: The Hotel Savoy is almost an afterthought, sitting along the side of a highway, unmarked. The little hut that is there now is a replica; the original one was burned down by some kids several years ago. Haug opened the door for me. Inside the hut was a wooden platform, like the one Baalsrud was lying on when, half-mad with agony, he took a knife to his own feet. ‘‘No one else knew about him,’’ Haug said. ‘‘He wondered, if Marius is caught, who should help him?’’ Baalsrud sterilized the knife in the flame of the lamp, then washed his feet with liquor and took a swig before cutting.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Haug shut the door. Slivers of light beamed through the cracks. All I could hear was the howling of the wind, blasting between the planks of wood. A minute or two later, I was more than ready to leave. Glad for air, I walked with Haug below the high ridge where Marius and his friends, once they did come back, painstakingly pulled Baalsrud, still strapped to a sled, up to another hiding spot, 2,700 feet higher than the Hotel Savoy, where they had to leave him again. At the top of the ridge, Haug said, there was a large boulder, nicknamed the Gentleman’s Stone, about 15 feet high, 18 feet wide and flat on one side, as if it had been cut with a knife. This was where Baalsrud lay for nine more days, buried in a cave of snow most of the time, waiting for help to return. Even the most devoted and informed people about the story have had difficulty determining which boulder it is. ‘‘My stone is the right one,’’ Haug said proudly.  Photo        The Hotel Savoy.   Credit Jon Tonks for The New York Times    When the next group of helpers finally found Baalsrud, they still couldn’t take him all the way to Sweden. Instead, they traveled a bit and then set up another shelter for him while they went to find more help. Even now, it’s a 90-minute walk from the nearest village. Again, there is nothing marking the spot, just a steep mountainside with a little overhang, but open to the elements. This is where Baalsrud’s story loses all recognizable shape. He spent five days under the open sky, growing confused, despondent and finally hopeless. At one moment in Howarth’s book, Baalsrud puts a gun to his head, but the trigger had frozen, and he didn’t have the strength to pull it; in Haug’s, he merely tells his rescuers they would be better off if they just left him there to die. A team of helpers finally found him again, taking him farther south to the Skaidijonni valley, where he would spend another 17 days in a cave, awaiting another team to transport him across the Swedish border. During his weeks there, Baalsrud completed the amputation of the rest of his toes. Meanwhile, a local farmer named Nils Nilsen had skied 40 miles to Sweden and 40 back to round up more help for Baalsrud. By the time a group of Sami, Norway’s indigenous people, came to take him across the border, Baalsrud weighed just 80 pounds. The Sami harnessed the sled to a team of reindeer and, racing through a corner of Nazi-aligned Finland, they finally crossed over into neutral Sweden by way of a frozen lake, with the Germans following close behind. It took six months in a hospital in Sweden for Baalsrud to climb back from the brink, overcoming the loss of his toes, putting weight back on, regaining his eyesight. He went to Scotland and, after learning to walk again, helped to train Allied soldiers in marksmanship. At the end of the war, he returned to Norway to witness his country’s liberation firsthand. Then he returned to his old life, outside Oslo. ‘‘I had forgotten the whole story, or rather I had tried to forget it all,’’ Baalsrud said in a radio interview years later, ‘‘and it was completely forgotten when David Howarth came.’’ Howarth, a journalist and Royal Navy officer, wrote ‘‘We Die Alone’’ based largely on the Norwegian military report on the escape that Baalsrud filed during his recovery and interviews with Baalsrud himself. A lyrical writer with a great feel for suspense, Howarth strained to understand Baalsrud — not just his astounding resilience but also his essential melancholy. The books are but one reflection of how Baalsrud’s story has aged into an inspiring parable about the character of all Norwegians: their resilience, their selflessness, their devotion to community. ‘‘He became the symbol and the hope for the resistance,’’ said Harald Zwart, a prominent Dutch-Norwegian film director who works in Hollywood (he made the ‘‘Karate Kid’’ remake and ‘‘The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones’’) and is currently shooting a long-planned remake of Baalsrud’s story as a snowy version of ‘‘The Fugitive.’’ ‘‘They needed to keep him alive in order to keep the dream of freedom alive. He grew to be bigger than himself.’’ Baalsrud himself rejected that myth, time and again. After consulting on the production of ‘‘Ni Liv,’’ Baalsrud returned to the life he had started with his wife, Evie, an American from a wealthy family. Their daughter, Liv, told Haug that her father never wanted to talk about what had happened in the fjords. ‘‘Jan was also depressed after the war; I heard from his brother,’’ Haug said.  Photo        The Gentleman’s Stone, where Baalsrud lay for nine days.   Credit Jon Tonks for The New York Times    The folk hero would not return to the fjords again until 1987. The Gronvoll children, now all grown, invited me for lunch in their home in Furuflaten, where Baalsrud made his final visit. Marius and Agnete’s daughter Kjellaug served rolls with cheese and jam, then cake, then coffee. A few framed black-and-white photos of Baalsrud’s earlier visit in the 1950s, during production of ‘‘Ni Liv,’’ hung on the wall of the parlor. The later visit was less triumphant, more poignant.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Baalsrud was visibly frail. Marius was no longer alive, but Agnete was. ‘‘When Jan was here, she didn’t want journalists inside,’’ Kjellaug said. ‘‘She wanted to have Jan alone in here, just with her.’’ When Baalsrud left, Agnete was bereft. ‘‘She said afterward that he was in such bad shape that it would have been better if he was dead than still alive,’’ her son Dag said. Back home, Baalsrud fell and fractured his hip, and X-rays revealed a cancerous tumor that had already metastasized. An ambulance plane took him to Oslo University Hospital, but it was too late. Before he died on Dec. 30, 1988, he was moved to a rehabilitation center near Oslo that his own donations and support had helped to create. His last wish was to be buried in the fjords, in the village of Mandal, alongside the grave of Aslak Fossvoll, a Norwegian resistance leader who visited Baalsrud in the cave at Skaidijonni, only to die of diphtheria four weeks after Baalsrud made it safely to Sweden. Even at the end, Baalsrud’s thoughts were never far from the capriciousness of fate: Who lives and who dies, who survives and who doesn’t, who is most deserving of honor and praise. That visit to Furuflaten was the only time Marius and Agnete’s children met the man who so profoundly shaped the lives of their family. Their son Are remembered standing with Baalsrud outside their house, next to the barn where he once hid for days. Together, he and the old man stared out at the valley where, 44 years earlier, he had staggered, snow-blind, after an avalanche, making his way to the safety of Marius’s farm. Are, just a teenager, had to ask the great man a question: Of all the homes in the valley, how did he find his way here?   ‘‘I don’t know,’’ he said. But then the old soldier grinned grimly, gritting his teeth, and glanced at Are. ‘‘I can tell you something, youngest son of Marius,’’ he said. ‘‘Next time it’s war, it’s not me coming down this ice. It’s you.’’   Correction: April 3, 2016   An article on March 20 about Jan Baalsrud, a member of the Norwegian resistance in World War II, misstated the age of Tore Haug, an authority on Baalsrud.
