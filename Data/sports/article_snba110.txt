The boycott is, of course, a major problem, but there is far more than that to worry about. The Olympic movement and the International Olympic Committee, or I.O.C., must rapidly come to grips with a host of key matters that simply will not go away: the absurd contradictions in determining amateur eligibility, the role of athletes themselves in charting the future of the games, the long-overdue enlargement of opportunities for women. Regrettably, the I.O.C. is out to lunch. The most pressing question is whether the Olympic movement can survive repeated invasions by governments that want to make participation an adjunct of foreign policy. Hitler's exaltation of Aryan superiority at the 1936 Games in Berlin seems mild in comparison with more recent acts: the Palestinian terrorist attack at Munich in 1972, the 1980 American-led withdrawal to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and now the Soviet boycott of the Los Angeles Games. The purpose of the Olympic movement is to provide competition among the world's athletes and thus to advance international understanding. But those noble objectives are seriously compromised when governments try to use the Olympics to score points for their foreign policies. The Olympics don't belong to world governments. They belong to the world's athletes. It's impossible to eliminate government involvement. But we should seize every opportunity to reduce it to a minimum.

The United States Olympic Committee has proposed this idea to its counterpart in the Soviet Union - indeed, our committee opposed President Jimmy Carter's decision to withdraw from the 1980 Moscow Olympics, although once he made the decision we felt obliged to stand behind him. Whether there is any breathing room at all between the Soviet Olympic Committee and the Soviet Foreign Ministry is yet to be seen, but we think a noncancellation pact would put a far greater burden on governments that try to wrap their foreign policy in the Olympic flag.

The member nations would be asked to commit themselves to participate in the games at these sites regardless of future political considerations. An advance commitment would make it far more difficult to withdraw at the last minute, particularly if the I.O.C. imposed a substantial withdrawal penalty.  The logic for having more than one ''permanent'' site is self-evident. If the Games were tied to one country, the entire Olympic movement would be hostage to that country's politics in every Olympic year. There are no permanently neutral sites in this contentious world and it is extremely naive to assume otherwise.  Putting the games on a sound financial basis is another imperative. Currently, 80 percent of the Olympic budget is derived, one way or the other, from the United States, particularly the sale of broadcast rights. Various I.O.C. leaders frequently make indignant speeches condemning ''commercialization'' of amateur athletics, but they rarely complain about the burgeoning cost of the vast international athletic bureaucracies that eagerly consume so much of the proceeds. It is time they understood that the huge deficits that would come from banning ''commercialization'' would promptly doom the Olympic movement. The Los Angeles Games promise to be a spectacular model for private-sector support of the movement, and the I.O.C. should incorporate the successful aspects of the Los Angeles experience into a long-range program of support.  But while the Olympic movement burns, the I.O.C. fiddles. There is, in fact, a Commission on the Olympic Movement in the I.O.C. structure, but at a recent meeting it chose to ignore the Games' long-term future and instead focused singly and simple- mindedly on the implications of the 1984 Soviet-led boycott. The world's athletes deserve a lot better than this.  Take the question of who is and is not an ''amateur''. The Olympics, everyone believes, are for amateurs. Anyone who believes this proposition believes also in the tooth fairy. For years, the various international sports federations have generated elaborate criteria attempting to divide amateurs from professionals. Jim Thorpe was stripped of his 1912 Olympic medals when it was discovered that he had been paid to play in a few semipro baseball games. Decisions are still made every week on whether an individual athlete has forfeited amateur status. Things have reached the point where no one can identify any real principle underlying these decisions. The result is a crazy quilt of hypocrisy and fraud.  Consider the case of Antoine Carr. A standout basketball player, Mr. Carr was drafted by the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association. He chose, however, to play for a team in the Italian Basketball League, which paid him a reported $200,000 a year. Does this make him a professional? Surprise! Because the International Amateur Basketball Federation chooses to believe that the Italian league is an amateur league, Carr remained eligible for our Olympic team, while Isiah Thomas, who did sign to play with the Pistons, became an ineligible professional. Consider the case of Ron Brown. This world-class sprinter, a fine football player, was drafted No. 1 by the Cleveland Browns in 1983. But he wanted his chance to run in the 1984 Olympics, so he stayed out of football for a year. Merely signing with the Browns - even if he never set foot upon the field - would have made him a professional. Brown appealed to the International Olympic Committee for permission to sign a contract, providing he did not actually play for the Browns before the Olympics. Absolutely not, said the I.O.C. Merely signing the paper makes you a pro, even though football is not even an Olympic sport.  Anyone for tennis? Under I.O.C. rules, any tennis player under the age of 21 may qualify. This means that college amateurs, if they are a day over 21, cannot play in the Olympics even though they have never taken a penny. It also means that professionals like Jimmy Arias and Mats Wilander, both under 2l, are eligible, even though they are earning half a million dollars a year!  The examples go on and on. There are hockey players and skiers and bike racers and skaters who are making big bucks through all kinds of ingenious devices. Phil Mahre, the American skier, has been quoted as saying that the top 50 competitors in international skiing make at least $50,000 a year. In short, hundreds of the world's best athletes are being forced to engage in sophisticated cheating to preserve their amateur status.

Will that support continue as the public becomes aware of the sophistries being used to separate ''amateurs'' from ''professionals''? Absolutely not, and it would be a tragedy for the I.O.C. and the sports federations to continue to pretend there is no problem here. The United States committee has asked the I.O.C. to adopt new, clear, understandable principles on eligibility. In condensed form, they are: 1. An Olympic athlete loses eligibility only if he or she is paid for competing in that particular sport. An athlete can be an amateur in one sport and a professional in another. 2. Signing a professional contract is not grounds for loss of amateur status in that sport, so long as payment is not received for signing and the athlete has not yet actually performed under contract.  3. Endorsing a commercial product, earning publication royalties or making a public appearance for money are not grounds for disqualification so long as the money is not received for an actual athletic performance. These principles will make it possible to reach clear decisions in almost all the eligibility questions likely to come up. They recognize the economic facts of life and the necessity of support for athletes who incur sizable financial burdens for training and traveling. And they promise to bring honesty back into an area where its absence is rapidly becoming an international scandal. So far, the I.O.C. has shown virtually no interest in coming to grips with policies that inescapably entice young athletes into a web of dissimulation and dishonesty. When I again tried to bring this problem, among others, onto center stage at an I.O.C. meeting, I was condescendingly accused of ''lecturing'' by the former I.O.C. president, Lord Killanin, who claims to have heard the same point for the past 30 years. Explaining something sensible to Lord Killanin is akin to explaining something to a cauliflower. The advantage of the cauliflower is that if all else fails, you can always cover it with melted cheese and eat it. B Copyright c 1984 William E. Simon   William E.
