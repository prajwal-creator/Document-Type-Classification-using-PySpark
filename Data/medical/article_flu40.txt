Like an ungainly serpent, it negotiated its bulk through the studied quaintness of Kennebunkport, Maine, clogging the narrow artery of Route 9. The inhabitants of Kenne- bunkport, where the Bush family have long kept their summer home, had grown more or less accustomed to such spectacles. For that matter, the sight of a caravan departing town for Interstate 95, southbound to New Hampshire, was unsurprising to those who followed presidential politics. George Herbert Walker Bush had literally been down this road before—once as a virtual unknown, then as a frontrunner, and a third time as a president seeking reelection. But this was another era, another Bush. This was an altogether different beast. Not counting state police escorts, the motorcade consisted of eight vehicles. Five of them—two vans and three buses—conveyed nearly two hundred reporters from around the world, supervised by an assortment of fresh-faced young Texans and veterans from the first Bush administration. Two other vans ferried an armada of political aides: gurus, money counters, truth spinners, image makers, stagecrafters, and a young man and young woman each assigned to the personal care of the candidate and his wife. The eighth vehicle—driven by a member of Texas's elite law-enforcement corps, the Rangers—contained four passengers: fifty-two-year-old Governor George W. Bush; his wife, Laura; Bush's cousin by marriage, Craig Stapleton of Greenwich, Connecticut; and the governor's alter ego, muse, and message disciplinarian, Karen Hughes. The oceanside town awaiting the motorcade, New Castle, normally counted its populace as eight hundred. Fully two hours in advance of the fleet's arrival, another six hundred New Hampshirites had begun to congregate along the Commons—some holding miniature flags, others carrying postcard invitations from the Bush campaign orga-   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   nization. A makeshift cityscape of camera crews and satellite dishes lined the beach. The town's four cops were joined outside by five ringers from the state police—the nine of them no doubt a fitting squadron for a lilac-festival parade or a snowmobile pileup. Today, they might as well have been scarecrows.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       A heavy fog presided that morning. When the caravan at last arrived on Wentworth Road, thirty minutes behind schedule, it did so amid an uproar of disembodied hysteria. The sedan doors swung open—a peeling back of the curtains as Act One of the 2000 primary season began and its lead actor took the stage. George W. Bush stepped out into the tidal wave of hands and screams. For perhaps a second, it might have appeared that he didn't warrant such a gathering. Though Bush cut a nimble figure in his fine summer suit, he lacked the toothy ebullience of a Reagan or a Kennedy, the eager charm of a Clinton. This candidate—and New Hampshirites had met scores of candidates—seemed unexceptional in dimension and bearing. Normal, really, in every way. How to explain, then, the sonic force of his presence as he waded among them? How his strong hand grabbed yours and pulled you into his airspace so that the tanned and slightly bemused (kinda weird, isn't this?) face was right in yours. Unaffected, big-brotherly, oddly confidential as his keen blue eyes locked in on yours. This guy liked—no, loved (but didn't quite crave) the crush of flesh. The New Hampshirites had seen them all. They'd seen another Bush, too. Decent fellow. This one was different. A Bush, but not simply that. In New Hampshire, like nowhere else in America, they got close, and they could tell. A few strides behind Bush, left in his wake, was his wife. Her eyes betrayed a flicker of frailty as the crowd closed in on her. But then Laura Bush composed herself. And she, like her husband, had something. Not rambunctious at all in the way of George W., but in her oppositeness the two seemed of an intimate piece. "We're very excited to be here"—over and over she said it, unable to find other words and unwilling to fumble through them as her husband might. Still, you could see why he loved her, and why he depended on her, and why she would be, if not a force, then in her own way an asset. The Bushes mounted a stage. Standing beside them, the preppy scion / Senator Judd Gregg bellowed, "So we are ready to ROLL!"—and then unscrolled a parchment, eight feet of it, lapping across the stage: some 250 names, effectively the New Hampshire political universe, all pledged to the cause of George W. Bush. Under a white tent, the candidate took questions from the media. Someone asked about immigration. He answered in Spanish. Someone asked him about a litmus test for judicial appointees. There would be none, said the governor. Someone asked him about his famously ambiguous youthful indiscretions. Bush confidently demurred: "There is a game in Washington. It's called 'gotcha.' It's the game where they float a rumor and make the candidate prove a negative. And I'm not playing the game, Jack." Later that morning, at the New Castle public library, Bush sat next to a little boy and asked him how he was doing. "Awesome," the boy replied.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   "I'm awesome, too," said George W. Bush. That week, a New Hampshire poll indicated that Bush's popularity surpassed that of all nine of his Republican opponents combined. You could not be faulted for believing that this was, as the press often put it, a juggernaut—a bloodless, ever-calculating, unerring victory machine. By the end of the 1999–2000 election cycle, the Bush campaign would raise more money ($193 million) and spend more ($186 million) than any other in American history, by a long shot. Its elaborate campaign organization—a corporate/populist hybrid devised by Karl Rove and Ken Mehlman, replete with "metrics" and "viral marketing," a lexicon never before uttered in a presidential race—drove a stake into the flabby old model of hierarchies and smoke-filled rooms. And, as sheer merchandise, no political commodity could trump George W. Bush: son of a president, governor of a big state, ferociously disciplined yet engaging, a self-styled "different kind of Republican" but nonetheless with the full backing of his party, and with Rove and Karen Hughes—geniuses in their craft—to guide him at every turn. You could track the juggernaut's progress from that first day in New Castle and find little during that summer of 1999 to challenge your belief in its invulnerability. The Bush monstrosity returned to New Hampshire a month later, on the Fourth of July. Other Republican presidential candidates attended the local parades. But among the aspirants, only George W. Bush walked astride a gauntlet of local heavyweights, all but carried on their shoulders. And then in a third, almost mythical moment, on July 31, the Bush couple arrived by an antique wooden boat across the silky waters of Lake Winnipesaukee to the shores of Wolfeboro, passing under a bridge crammed with sign-waving fanatics. No fog besmirched the postcard this time. The advance men had slotted a half hour for mingling, but the candidate was feeling Wolfeboro's love—he was sweating and gabbing—and nobody wanted this to end. And so the entourage was late that afternoon arriving at a block party in the well-heeled town of Dover, where mounted police galloped forth to block off Quail Drive and the Bush Winnebago nearly mowed down a swarm of goggle-eyed children on bicycles. While the governor joshed and flipped burgers in a large backyard tent, two Texas Rangers wearing supersize belt buckles stood inside the house, transfixed by the spectacle of a stuffed and mounted indigenous moose's head . . . the absolute biggest goddamned thing they'd ever seen. But as you took in the sight of these two tough legends gaping like choirboys at a dead animal on a wall, you realized what you were seeing—namely, that this Bush machine was not a machine at all. It was, at best, an army: prone to mortal wounds, fallible in judgment, flailing its way through an ungovernable war. And looking closer, beneath all that polished machinery, you could plainly see that this army's general, George W. Bush, sported no battle scars . . . and that for all his fine leadership portfolio, he did not really know what political combat was. A competitor—he was that. He loved to smoke a jogging mate right before the finish line. He sulked after the Texas legislature denied him his property tax reform initiative. But Bush was neither by temperament nor by upbringing a warrior. Indeed, he disdained the bullying image of conservatism—"It's mean," was his view—and publicly sparred with the troglodytes in both the state and national Republican Party. By marketing himself as a Compassionate Conservative, George W. Bush was all but encouraging Americans to view him as a softie. Oh, he promoted something called the Responsibility Era as his big idea: a tough-love tonic to the Boomers' Era of (as he never tired of saying on the stump) "If it feels good, do it, and if you've got a problem, blame somebody else." Every presidential aspirant, after George Herbert Walker Bush made the flip comment in 1992 about his lack of a "Vision Thing," needed one, and this was his. But Bush didn't communicate through ideas. (That was Rove's way.) He tended to act by impulse, without apology, calling himself a "doer," "decider," "provoker," "charger," and "not a very good psychoanalyst guy." Trusting one's gut was a good thing; gazing in the same anatomical area, at one's navel, struck him as an indulgence of the weak willed. And yet, in George W. Bush's masculine world, there was no shame in exhibiting sensitivity. He was, in addition to the above, a self-confessed "cryer." For all his gut checking, he spoke far more often of what was "in my heart." Presence? Bush had it in abundance. At the same time, there was a thorough absence of grandiosity to the man—unless you counted his claim to be "a uniter, not a divider" . . . which, given his record of bipartisan accomplishment in Texas, not only had the force of truth behind it but bespoke an appealing modesty: I'm here to bring us all together, not to hog the spotlight. Whether or not he really was "a different kind of Republican," Bush was a different kind of candidate, one who had not coveted from birth the most powerful position in the known universe. Where one expected to find ego, one instead encountered a brotherly . . . was it sweetness? Whatever it was, to a nation fatigued by the bruising Clinton psychodramas, the affable compassion of George W. Bush was surely a welcome antidote.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   This, at least, was the calculation of Karen, Rove, and Bush himself. Of course, they would play to win. But for all his competitive instincts, Bush harbored no lifelong yearning for this particular competition. And wasn't that—along with his terrierlike hair, his untutored posture, his goofy faces, and his daily disfiguring of the English language—proof that he was anything but a political animal? Wouldn't they see, and love, that he was real? A compassionate general, evincing not so much as an ember of the warrior's fire in the belly—this was an advantage, wasn't it? The bigness was the first problem. After the triumphant swing through Wolfeboro and Dover that same July 31, the Bush caravan figured to round off the day with a visit to North Conway. This small town with a charming drugstore on Main Street was a veritable slice of Americana, eye candy for the evening news. The governor climbed out of the Winnebago and was immediately engulfed. Barricades, the media hordes, cops, and advance men hollering and shoving . . . Bush got as far as across the street from the pharmacy, couldn't penetrate any farther. He could only wave sheepishly at the drugstore employees, shake a few hundred outstretched hands, and then retreat to the Winnebago. New Hampshire was about smallness. Being the last bastion of that quaint idyll, retail politics, New Hampshire cherished—demanded—being won over, as they loved to say, "one voter at a time." Elsewhere in America, the motorcade itself was the show, the roaring sirens and the gleaming limos and the chiseled broadcasters no less crucial to the experience than the candidate himself. New Hampshirites didn't give a damn about all that. They wanted face time. They wanted to be wooed. Therein lay the tension. Because the Bush campaign wasn't about charming the folks of the Granite State, strictly speaking. It was about George W. Bush becoming president of the United States. And this meant several things. It meant, for a fellow with only four years' worth of statewide governing experience, looking presidential—vaguely imperial, heavily endorsed, above the fray of the also-rans. And indeed, that was Rove's directive to advance chief Brian Montgomery when the latter was staging events: "Make it look presidential." Sweeping backdrops, all TV cameras poised to capture the candidate at iconic angles . . . and for God's sake, tell the damn Ranger security force not to wear their goddamn cowboy hats! It meant playing things safe. Like a hockey season, wrote the campaign's pollster, Matthew Dowd, in an early 1999 memo, referring to these early primaries. The regular season's sole practical function is to prepare the team for the playoffs—without sustaining injuries or exposing weaknesses. So, no showing the whole playbook. No improvising. And no freaking out the voters with radical notions following the Clinton era of Peace & Prosperity. As Rove would proclaim with cherubic meta-irony, "We're the candidate of reasonable, cautious, prudent reform." (Or as Stuart Stevens, the bon vivant ad guy, would more smirkily put it: "Things have never been better. Vote for change.") And it meant winning 270 electoral votes. "We're running a fifty-state campaign"—even Karen couldn't maintain the gusto every time she chanted Team Bush's mantra. But yes, a candidate with an obscene war chest could afford to spread the field and look down the road to November 7, 2000. For the cash-poor opposition in the summer of 1999, America was a nation of five states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Michigan, and Arizona. And so they courted the early-primary voters with a hard-luck boy's fevered desperation . . . while the prince and presumptive nominee, anything but desperate, did not.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Of course, this strategy ran the risk of offending the flinty yet somewhat spoiled citizens of the First Primary State. But New Hampshire's fetish for giant killing was hardly a secret. Rove certainly knew it—and, courtesy of Bill Clinton and frontrunners past, knew this as well: A giant could survive New Hampshire . . . provided (as in Clinton's case) the wounds were only of the flesh. Sitting in the van, appraising his new state adviser, Tom Rath—who had come on board only after his first choice, Lamar Alexander, had given up the race—Bush chose his words carefully. "I understand you know box scores better than anyone else around here," he said. "How many hits did Harold Baines get last night?" "Two," said Rath. "You stay right here with me, Rathbone." He dispensed nicknames the way his attentive young bodyman, Logan Walters, whipped out the canister of hand spray after a round of gripping and grinning. "Hey, Barbarini!" to field director Barbara Russell. "Things okay, Robbyboy?" to state cochair Robb Thomson. Local admaker Pat Griffin was Griffey, U.S. Congressman Charlie Bass the Bassmaster. . . . In this way, the Texan closed the distance and his Granite State hired hands instantly became towel-snapping teammates. To some, this might have seemed a hollow gesture, or even condescending. (Back at the Governor's Mansion in Austin, Bush had received the highly respected Ohio congressman and presidential hopeful John Kasich with a booming, "Johnnyboy!" Kasich wondered where the hell Bush got off reducing national figures to mascots.) Yet these politicos, hardly virgins—Reagan, Bush I, Dole, Alexander, and Gramm were among their past clients—felt a strange tingle in the presence of George W. They loved the guy. Loved the realness: pounding back the Cheetos, farting on the plane, gossiping about the sexual exploits of the traveling press. He was unfailingly kind to the B-teamers. Hated to keep anyone waiting—always on time. (Actually, almost always early. What was that about?) Stepping into his hotel room in the morning, they'd find him reading his Bible over breakfast. He revered his wife, was noticeably less jagged when Laura was traveling with him. And it was kind of sweet, his unabashed longing to be back home in Texas, and that feather pillow from the mansion he carried with him . . . a factoid that the press jumped on like starved hyenas. New Hampshire, too, would love this guy. Of this the local deputies were convinced. But how to get him out there . . . how to let the people see George W. Bush the way they saw him . . . letting Bush be Bush—but at the same time, letting New Hampshire be New Hampshire . . . His New Hampshire staff was having a hard time getting the Texans to understand the hokey imperatives of a campaign here. People craved yard signs, buttons, corny slogans, and garish T-shirts. Judd Gregg's pale-eyed chief of staff, Joel Maiola, loved churning this stuff out. Bush sheriff's badges, Bush baseball cards. Later in winter, T-shirts trumpeting the Reason for Freezin' campaign. And buttons sporting three big W's: Win With W. (The Texans vetoed that last one. Molly Ivins, the left's feline Will Rogers, had taken to calling Bush Dubya, an indelible slander. So no using the middle initial—EVER!)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The Texans, for their part, were having a hard time getting the local aides to understand: There was a strategy, and it would be followed. Period. Must Stay on Message. Overseeing this was the towering woman with the practical swimmer's hairdo, Karen Hughes. When Karen said of Message Discipline, "I don't know much, but this is one thing I think I'm good at," the governor's communications director was semi-nicely saying, Fall in line, pal. Karen knew Message and she knew Bush. Of New Hampshire and national campaigns she was thoroughly ignorant. Someone—the local gurus blamed Karen; she blamed them—had failed to warn Bush about Boston News 7's Andy Hiller, a Harvard-bred trickster who finagled quality time with the candidate on November 1, 1999. Hiller began innocently enough, asking if the governor believed himself to be weak on foreign policy. "No. I've got a clear vision of where I want to lead America," came the reply—forceful but general, a sign that his answers to the next questions would be disastrous. "Can you name the president of Chechnya?" "No. Can you?" "Can you name the president of Taiwan?" "Yeah. Lee. Wait a minute—is this Fifty Questions?" "No. It's four questions of four leaders of four hot spots." The leader of Pakistan? "The new Pakistani general. Just been elected—he's not been elected," Bush corrected himself. "The guy took over office. . . . It appears he's going to bring stability to the country, and I think that's good news for the subcontinent." Hiller interrupted the filibuster: "And you can name him?" "General—I can name the general . . ." "And it's . . ." "General," Bush concluded miserably. Finally: How about the prime minister of India? "Uh . . . no." His competitive juices seething, Bush countered with a question he no doubt wished Hiller had asked: "Can you name the foreign minister of Mexico?" With an undertaker's half-smile, Hiller replied, "No, sir, but I would say to that, I'm not running for president."   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   As soon as Hiller was done, Karen accosted him. He needed, it was his duty as a supposedly objective journalist, to administer the very same quiz to all the other candidates. Hiller was unsympathetic. Breathlessly, Karen phoned Josh Bolten back at 301 Congress in Austin. "Do you know the answers to any of those?" she demanded. "Well, Musharraf," replied Bolten. (He'd lived with a Pakistani guy once.) Karen hung up, started fielding the press calls. "Even our policy director didn't know the answers!" she began. ("Great, Karen," muttered Bolten when this spin job got back to him. "Now we all look like idiots.") Once composed, Karen summoned the Message: Her boss was "seeking to be the leader of the free world, not a Jeopardy! contestant." Too little too late. And so tonight it might be a good idea to give the governor some time alone. The great thing about him? Tomorrow, he would let it go. Which was not the same thing as forgetting. For weeks thereafter, they'd hear it from Bush, at the beginning of this or that briefing: "Okay, you guys are supposed to be so smart. Who's the president of Trinidad?" *    *    * Karen wasn't like other communications directors. She wasn't like Gore's Chris Lehane, only too happy to dish with the press over cocktails. Not that she wasn't fond of a nice chardonnay, and of . . . well, some of the reporters. (She'd been one herself, after all.) But Karen was, to use her word, an "advocate." The press didn't seem to get this. The cause she advocated was not that of warm and fuzzy media relations. It was that of George W. Bush: her friend, whose moods and preferences she could anticipate with Doppler accuracy. Though she was blessed with a gratifying life of family and faith back home in Austin, there was in fact no other cause for Karen. She would not be re-upping with some other campaign should the governor somehow lose. Though she had done time in the early 1990s flacking for the Texas Republican Party, Karen wasn't Rove—she wasn't a political animal. In this way, she was very real . . . just as in her thorough understanding of the needs of a man not her husband, she was rather unreal. The governor needed downtime. He needed naps and he needed to jog. The governor needed loyalty more than expertise. Karen, Rove, Logan Walters; Israel "Izzy" Hernandez, the first Walters, now a valued utility player who knew no politics other than Bushworld; Mark "M-Cat" McKinnon, a lifelong Democrat admaker who'd sworn off politics until a dinner with the governor in 1997 left him hopelessly smitten; Dan Bartlett, whose entire adult life had been spent in the service of Rove and Bush; the young press aides, smooth Gordon Johndroe and Mindy "Xena Warrior Princess" Tucker (so nicknamed for the way the Amazonian redhead personally blockaded gubernatorial opponent Garry Mauro when he tried to crash a Bush press conference) . . . All Texans, all talented—but it was their belief in him, their omnipresence in his corner, and their desire never to let him down that the governor most needed. The governor needed to know the point of things. Not the details. Just: What is the particular purpose in this fourth stop on our schedule today, who's thought this through, what is the strategy behind going into another one of these diners, and if there isn't one why the HELL are we doing it—KARL!   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Bush's local ambassador, Senator Judd Gregg, understood this about him. We're going to Merrill Lynch and Fidelity, Gregg would patiently explain, because business offices are fast becoming the town halls of the twenty-first century. Which struck the Texans as a load of horseshit—the governor standing in an insurance company cafeteria in front of a thousand people in suits, all the pageantry of an Amish funeral . . . but Gregg had a point, if not much of one. (Actually, Gregg's unspoken point was this: If you showed up in New Hampshire more often, we wouldn't have to jam a thousand voters into every event. If you were willing to let him get up close and personal with the voters, you'd have more pageantry than you knew what to do with. If you were actually running to win the New Hampshire primary, rather than running not to lose the election . . .) The governor needed not to be made a fool of. He could laugh at himself, but only if the joke was of his instigation. One evening in Bedford, Bush mingled with well-heeled contributers at the $3.1 million home of Dean Kamen, the dark-eyed eccentric whose inventions included the Segway. Kamen had been a generous supporter, and, being a politician, it was the governor's tendency to indulge such benefactors. The schedule had been murder, however. Last night he'd been in Iowa. Tomorrow there would be a debate. The inventor seemed unaware of this. He seemed intent on touring Bush through every corner of his fifteen-thousand-square-foot abode. Checking out his swimming pool . . . his softball field . . . his closet . . . his helicopter hangar . . . It was getting close to nine-thirty, past the candidate's bedtime, when Kamen said, "I want you to sit in this wheelchair." The contraption was another of Kamen's inventions. It could literally climb stairs. Ingenious, but, well heck, look at the time . . . Against his better judgment, Bush sat. Kamen moved the control switch. The wheelchair bucked, its two front wheels in midair. Bush's eyes went wide with panic. Then the chair, with the governor in it, clunked its way up Kamen's staircase. When Bush got out of the chair, he fixed the night's handler, Tom Rath, with a look that could have curdled plutonium. But just in case Rathbone hadn't gotten the message, the governor delivered it aloud, as soon as they had thanked their host and returned to the car: "Don't ever do that to me again." The ride back to the hotel was very quiet. The governor needed there to be no surprises. This was, of course, a tricky matter for Karen and the others to arrange in a fifty-state campaign. And besides, New Hampshirites longed for the unscripted encounter. They would stand before Bush while he unspooled all the cornpone canned jokes that went over so well in Iowa. . . . Scowls. So he'd start riffing on Social Security . . . and the people in the audience took notes! And then he'd catch himself, go back to the script. . . . More scowls. The local staff said he needed to do radio shows, so Bush did radio shows. During one call-in program on a Keene station, a fellow grilled Bush on abortion. The governor recited his pro-life stance. The next caller grilled him further. "I've said all I'm going to say on that," Bush pushed back, "my position's clear. I'd like to talk about education, some of the other things we've done in Texas. . . ." But because the press had been all over Bush about abortion and whether he would apply a Roe v. Wade litmus test to judicial nominees, the radio grilling continued, and Bush was unable to get back on message. In frustration, the governor flung the phone at a local aide. "You got any more bright ideas, smart guy?" he snapped.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   For the most part, however—and this was what made the whole business of avoiding surprises particularly dicey—Bush often excelled when he was flying blind. Sure, there would be errors, some more gruesome than others. ("Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?") And the press would titter, while ordinary folks would nod and say, Ol' George, he's one of us. The local gurus marveled at Bush's "eternal handshake," but it wasn't a question of stamina or stunts—it was just a natural skill: Up close, the man could flat win you over. But the governor didn't want that. He wanted predictability. Surprises put him on edge. And so it fell to the advance men, after handing out flyers and knocking on doors and calling businesses on behalf of the soon-to-be-coming-to-your-town frontrunner George W. Bush, to answer the inevitable query: "Is he going to stand there and take our questions?" And the reply was: "No, he's not going to." When the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce expressed its indignation, which the local aides duly reported to Austin—This is insane, he's in New Hampshire, for Christ's sake—deputy campaign manager Maria Cino relented, but only barely. If the governor got tripped up, she warned darkly, there would be hell to pay. Meekly, the aides got back to the folks in Londonderry and asked, Uh, could you submit your questions in advance? Later, the Texans gave slightly more ground. The governor would take questions. . . . Except, here are what the questions will be. On orders, the New Hampshire staff began to plant questioners in the audience. The deck stacking unsettled even some of the Texans who so believed in their boss. Why was it necessary, they wondered quietly among themselves, to embed loudly cheering Texans at every event? Couldn't their guy inspire the crowd on his own? If a twice-elected governor couldn't handle a few impromptu questions, the odd heckler . . . should he really be running for president? Was this any way to audition for leader of the free world? But in point of fact, there was one other thing the governor needed. He needed to win. Bush did not like to lose. Couldn't stand even thinking about it, or hearing his aides ratchet down the expectations. Which is why, while slouching in a chair and examining a speech draft, he would growl, "What's this 'if I'm elected'?" Herein lay the most bedeviling conundrum, however: Though the victory strategy was to play it safe, George W. Bush could not win by playing it safe. It was basic to the man: He needed the adrenaline rush of competition. Without the whiff of defeat in his nostrils, he tended to lose focus, seeming to forget what distinguished him from all the other fortunate sons.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   And Bush didn't detect that alarming whiff in New Hampshire. Quite the opposite, really. By August 1999, according to a Wall Street Journal poll, 59 percent of the respondents preferred the governor as the Republican nominee for the presidency. Somewhere far down the list was a senator from Arizona by the name of John McCain, with 3 percentage points. ""Boys," said the senator, "remember the words of Chairman Mao: It's always darkest before it's totally black." Husky cascades of laughter—the jaunty melody of a candidate with absolutely nothing to lose. That was the soundtrack to John McCain's Straight Talk Express. It was what he'd promised aides like Mike Dennehy and Roy Fletcher—really, the only thing he had promised: "We might not win, but we're going to have a hell of a lot of fun." A novel pledge, if ultimately naïve. Broke, sleep deprived, ignored by the press, and in the end snubbed by the voting public . . . underdog campaigns were typically about as fun as smallpox. And yet here they were, trundling across the Granite State like Ken Kesey's busload of giggly acid testers—at that point in time, the happiest campers in American politics. At the back of the bus, the candidate sat in a maroon swivel chair. A burly sixty-three-year-old fellow with thinning silver hair and ruddy cheeks who could make even a good suit look ill tailored, his appearance did nothing to warrant attention until you noticed how natural he was basking in it. Usually at his side hunched an unkempt figure straight out of a Grateful Dead jam session, strategist Mike Murphy . . . though at other times the second chair would be occupied by one of McCain's other archbishops, like the dour John "Sunny" Weaver or Mark Salter, the senator's quiet but intense wordsmith. The other half-dozen or so seats at the back of the bus would be filled by reporters. For eight, ten, fourteen hours, they fired questions at the candidate. And the candidate would answer—on the record, off the cuff, all day long, until finally the reporters had to excuse themselves so that they could go file their stories. Back in 1997, when the seeds for his candidacy were first planted, the concept was to present McCain as the Honest John antidote to Slick Willie Clinton. And throughout the campaign, the senator's most consistent applause line was, "My friends, I'm going to beat Al Gore like a drum." Still, reporters who'd been fed a spartan diet of Message Discipline could not help but regard this banquet of verbiage as clear and welcome evidence of the Anti-Bush. "McCain's base"—that's what the press became for the senator. Where Bush seemed most comfortable bantering with reporters about sports or the perils of child rearing, McCain welcomed multihour exchanges on tax cuts, campaign finance reform, Social Security, and the like. Not all the senator's positions were deeply felt. Though staunchly anti-abortion, he seemed uncomfortable when asked what he would do if his daughter were pregnant. His health care reforms were so poorly thought through that his press aides kept stammering out freshly modified numbers to exasperated reporters. And, on occasion, word would filter up to the front of the bus: He's, uh, putting his foot in his mouth. At which point Weaver would stalk down the aisle. "Senator? Hate to interrupt. Cindy's on the phone for you."  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Aboard the bus, Weaver and Salter openly discussed ad scripts, almost defiant in their confidence that the press would keep mum. But was this gentleman's agreement necessarily a bad thing? Warhorses   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   like Curtis Wilkie from the Boston Globe enthused that this was what it used to be like, back when movies cost a dollar and candidates didn't have handlers. . . . The Boys on the Bus revisited! Yet it felt postmodern rather than retro, this high-wire insurgency . . . which was why the dispatches from the Straight Talk Express began to take on a life of their own, throughout New Hampshire and beyond. The first of John McCain's 114 town hall meetings convened in April 1999 at an American Legion hall in Manchester, before a crowd of thirteen. They were veterans—the only natural McCain constituency that the Bush Machine hadn't tapped into—and they had been lured by flyers promising free ice cream. For the next two months, McCain's ice cream socials drew anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five brothers-in-arms. Somewhat to their surprise, the attendees found a candidate who wasn't terribly interested in speechifying. The senator would clear his throat for a couple of minutes, then ask the small audiences to say what was on their minds. The main question at that point was: Who the hell is John McCain, and what if anything does he stand for? Beyond Arizona and the Beltway, two things were known of him: He'd been a prisoner of war in Hanoi, and he'd been implicated in a savings-and-loan scandal a decade or so ago. Nothing about that heavy-cheeked face and reedy tenor hinted of the rousing drama the three-term senator would bring to an otherwise paint-by-numbers campaign season. McCain's maverick raison d'être was to cleanse the befouled campaign process, bringing the PACs and lobbyists to heel with serious reform so that well-intentioned public servants could concentrate on the nation's business rather than that of their sponsors. As a charter member of the Keating Five (the five senators compromised to varying degrees by savings-and-loan operator Charles Keating), McCain knew whereof he spoke. The repenting-sinner aspect was an especially deft touch, imbuing the senator with added authority while indemnifying him against charges of sanctimony. He chose not to overplay the war hero persona. At the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, the senator was just about to take the stage to give his speech supporting the reelection of President George H. W. Bush when a youthful-looking fellow grabbed him by the arm. You've gotta hammer Clinton on the draft dodging, the man said. Sorry, McCain replied to George W. Bush. That's not my thing. In early June 1999, a McCain event at the Derry VFW hall drew fifty-five locals, not all of them veterans. Some of the questions were nutty, and McCain's pugnaciousness was on free display. Later that month, a hundred elected representatives showed up to a free face-feed across from the statehouse. A buzz had commenced, and it grew exponentially in August, with the release of McCain's memoir, Faith of My Fathers. When Random House held McCain to the contractually stipulated three weeks of book promoting, the candidate's lieutenants feared that this would pose a fatal disruption in an already precarious campaign. They thought different after seeing two thousand book buyers standing in line at a Barnes & Noble in Atlanta.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Still, the McCain insurgency was a pauper's operation. While the frontrunner amassed and lavished fortunes throughout America, McCain's moneyman, Rick Davis, deposited a hard-earned $3 million in the bank, the interest from which was intended to be their budget for New Hampshire. The Bush campaign employed two full-time opposition researchers. McCain relied on AskJeeves.com. Bush had the Texas Rangers for security. McCain's detail consisted of a large fellow named Bob who ordinarily worked at a dry cleaner's and who carried with him a gym bag that may or may not have contained a firearm. Comparisons to the frontrunner's apparatus were irresistible. McCain did nothing to discourage them. By all rights, the Texan should have been the outsider, the eighteen-year veteran of Capitol Hill the emblem of the status quo. But Bush had all the money, all the endorsements, and none of the outsider's romanticism. Not that McCain himself didn't try to woo the kingmakers. Not that his gurus, when calling think tanks like the Heritage Foundation to request policy expertise, were altogether thrilled to hear the reply, "Sorry. We're committed to Bush." Goliath's role having already been taken, McCain deftly resorted to the slingshot. As Weaver would tell his subordinates, "We've got two things going for us: a better candidate, and a faster operation." By seven each morning, deputy press secretary Todd Harris would be disseminating talking points to morning radio shows, well before the local Bush offices were even lit up. Running rings around the front- runner became the favorite event in Team McCain's decathlon. Bush is doing two events today? Hell, let's do ten! A more obliging foil could scarcely be imagined. Bush's equivalent to the Straight Talk Express was his press plane, emblazoned Air Access but dubbed by its sullen inhabitants "No Access." McCain's boys simply referred to it as the Stalag—a continuing play on the metaphor peddled by Murphy: "We're the French Resistance. They're the German army." Even the senator, while professing a thorough distaste for negative campaigning, delighted in coy observations such as "Some would tell you" or "Others in this campaign"—and no one took these to be putdowns of Orrin Hatch. Officially, of course, he and his subordinates insisted that they had no beef of any kind with the governor. Respected the man, respected the operation, fully intended to obey Reagan's Eleventh Commandment about not speaking ill of a fellow Republican, etc. It was far from that simple. McCain's ranks included various individuals who had, at least implicitly, been snubbed by the Bush Machine. Particularly bad blood ran between Rove and his fellow Texan John Weaver, owing to some ancient Hatfield-McCoy dispute going back to when the two were among the few Republican consultants in a vast state that nonetheless seemed not big enough for them both. But above all, if this was to be a crusade, a certain moral superiority had to be mustered. And so McCain's boys took few pains to conceal their disdain—to "scratch the man who would be king, see if he bleeds to death," as Murphy so delicately put it. The day that the New York Times' Frank Bruni reported on Bush's feather pillow—"Don't you all bring your own pillows?" the governor was quoted as asking the press—was a day that found Weaver howling with laughter on the Straight Talk Express. And the day that Rick Berke, also of the Times, obliged Todd Harris's suggestion that the reporter look into a possible rift between Bush's New Hampshire operation and its Austin office, resulting in a page-one Sunday story . . . well, the boys on the bus said what they always said when outrageous good fortune plopped into their maverick laps: "What a fucking caper!" Bush's New Hampshire staff could feel the ship listing as the weather turned cold. With it came a creeping seasickness familiar to those deckhands who'd sunk with the elder Bush in 1980 and with Bob Dole in 1996. They could see it in the numbers, hear it on the evening news: New Hampshire was in full swoon, and not for George W. Bush. The temptation was to blame it all on Joe Allbaugh—Pinky, as Bush called him, though the campaign manager preferred to be known as The Enforcer, since it fit his gym coach's scowl and drill sergeant's flattop. (Before this image makeover, the Oklahoman had sported a ponytail.) Allbaugh showed a predilection for tough love. Though tasked chiefly with keeping Rove on a short leash, The Enforcer was never too busy to humble the lowly—as when he presided over a seminar for unpaid interns and held up a business card with his burly digits, growling, "Everything I have to say to you can fit on this. Every one of you is replaceable—doesn't matter who you are, I've got a hundred résumés sitting on my desk." With particular relish, it seemed to the local aides, Allbaugh said no to the uppity first-primary minions. No to a request for one more day for Bush in New Hampshire. No   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   to a request for yard signs. No to a request for name badges. No to a request for soap and toilet paper for the Concord office. They wanted to blame Allbaugh, or mother-knows-best Karen, or the ad guys like McKinnon whose wizardry was nowhere in evidence in the blasé spots that showed Bush and Laura sitting on a couch in Crawford. And while certainly no one wanted to blame Laura, it peeved them when she wowed the Concord Rotary Club on October 12 with her pastoral charms—and then, in the manner of her husband, departed the event without taking a single question. Alas, there was little doubt as to where the fault truly lay by late September, when George W. Bush informed his staff that he had no interest in attending the first presidential primary debate in New Hampshire on October 28. Big mistake—they'll take it as a slight, they're gonna call us arrogant. . . . Bush didn't care. He hated debates. He hated them for the same reasons that he hated press conferences and voter Q&A's. They were all about preening, a transparent exercise in gotcha, a chance for some bit player to seize the stage and disrupt the governor's Message. And anyway, these Republican primary debates weren't even debates. How could they be? At one time, Bush had ten rivals scrapping for the daily sound bite. By October 1999, five contenders of low to middling promise—Lamar Alexander, Dan Quayle, Elizabeth Dole, Bob Smith, and Pat Buchanan—had given up the ghost. But that still left McCain, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes, Gary Bauer, and Senator Orrin Hatch vying for the role of not-Bush. Why spend an hour onstage brawling for the microphone with mud wrestlers like Bauer and Keyes? Because that's part of it—showing them you're not afraid, that you don't need a script. It's just, you can't not show up. . . . The governor's aides pushed back: It's too soon, there's no upside, he needs to stay above the fray, fifty-state campaign. . . . Privately thinking: He could lose the debate. After days of internal bickering, the Bush camp issued its regrets: Alas, the governor would be in Dallas that evening, watching his wife, Laura, receive an award at her alma mater, Southern Methodist University. "I'm sorry I'm not there," Bush said on TV that day, not terribly convincingly.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In the days that followed, he would be sorrier. By early November, John McCain had vaulted ahead of Bush, 37–35, in the Time/CNN poll. Karen announced that despite the campaign's earlier refusal to participate in any debates before January, the governor would in fact show up at the next such event, on December 2 in Manchester. His performance that night was not what it needed to be. Virtually every one of Bush's answers included a reminder that he was "the governor of the second biggest state" and "the twelfth biggest economy in the world." More than once, he ran out of things to talk about and so concluded his answers early—a sensible, even admirable gesture, had George W. Bush not already been under suspicion of having little to say for himself. Winter brought unaccustomed misery. On the icy roads, the Texas Rangers wrecked three cars. The right-wing Manchester Union-Leader, never adoring of Bushes, spat out particular venom in its endorsement of Steve Forbes: "Bush is a nice guy but an empty suit with no philosophical underpinning." A half-dozen prominent supporters proudly announced their defection to the McCain camp, while several others quietly followed suit. The Judd Gregg eight-foot Roll Call of Endorsees, unraveled by Gregg only five months ago in New Castle, was now a fast-shriveling parchment. And even as Liddy Dole dropped out of the race and threw her support behind Bush—"a proven leader with optimism and faith," she drawled with, it seemed, distinctly vice-presidential vigor—the evidence was clear that her supporters were heading in the opposite direction, toward the senator from Arizona. Nothing worked, except to opposite effect. On January 24, Bush took the Iowa caucus. But what he termed a "record-shattering victory" was only a 41–30 triumph over the dreary Forbes—with McCain, who had eschewed Iowa altogether, getting five points anyway. On the Friday before primary day, the former New Hampshire governor and Bush 41 chief of staff John Sununu at last lumbered out of his indecision and declared himself a supporter of the Texas governor. As to the lateness of the endorsement, there were two theories: Either Sununu was hoping to be cast as the gallant difference-maker, or he was exacting a pound of flesh for having been fired as the elder Bush's chief nine years earlier. (Sununu's former deputy, Andy Card, had done the actual firing, but George W. had long bragged that he himself had dropped the hammer on his dad's behalf.) The reason, whichever it might be, was all about John Sununu, and the event—staged, for reasons only Judd Gregg could explain, at the offices of an insurance company—fell flat. Desperate for a momentum swing, and after much internal hand-wringing, the gurus did what they'd sworn not to do: They brought in Bush's father. "How's he doing?" George Herbert Walker Bush asked Tom Rath as they stared out into the impressive crowd assembled at the Milford Athletic Club on Saturday, January 29. "Well, he's pretty sick," said Rathbone. Which was true—the governor was fighting off the flu—but was not really what the ex- president meant. The father then turned to Pat Griffin. "Can we pull this off?" he asked. "I think it can still happen," replied Griffey. But he could see worry in the old man's face. After all: If things really were fine, then what the hell was Dad doing here?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The governor was summoned to the microphone. A thousand rapt attendees, waiting all day to hear the candidate speak. But Bush felt like crap, had nothing in the tank. Three minutes of We're gonna win on Tuesday, and he gave things over to George Herbert Walker Bush. Who spoke from the heart, his eyes tearing with pride, a quavering defiance in his voice: "This boy—this son of ours—is not going to let you down. . . ." And if you stood amid the audience, your heart melted with theirs. But if you sat in the rafters with the media—heard the chortles, saw the cell phones flip open—you knew that Daddy's boy was screwed. Monday, the day before the primary, the fateful Final Push, began in Manchester at a pancake flip-off. A competition, Bush's thing. "Watch this," the governor called out, and, flipping a pancake well above his head, he affected a centerfielder's nonchalance as he caught it with his spatula. "I'm gonna do it again," he declared to no one in particular. A flick of the wrist, the edible disk soaring . . . then neatly thudding onto Bush's spatula. Gary Bauer attempted the feat, and promptly fell off the riser. Bush won the flip-off hands down. Then the frontrunner's motorcade headed for the town of Exeter, where the candidate and his wife would mingle with the natives at a diner called the Loaf & Ladle, and afterward spend an hour walking door to door, the cameras capturing the Texas governor in full command of retail politics as he and his charming wife implored the good people of Exeter to join the Bushes in ushering in an era of Compassionate Conservatism and Personal Responsibility. That was the plan. That is what was on the schedule. But along the way, Bush's director of travel logistics, Brad Blakeman, got word from his boys on the ground that a gaggle of union protesters bused in from Massachusetts were standing in front of the Loaf & Ladle, holding up signs. Blakeman, Judd Gregg, and Joe Allbaugh huddled for about a millisecond. They knew well that nothing so rankled George W. Bush as being heckled. "We're turning around," Blakeman muttered into the radio.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But to where? The campaign now had two hours to kill. Joel Maiola made a call, then informed the other staffers: Madden's Family Restaurant in Derry would be happy to receive the governor. Which turned out to be the case—except that the proprietor had neglected to inform Maiola that the diner was virtually empty. For fully an hour the candidate and his entourage sat stewing in the booths, listening to the clock tick. Pat Griffin came up with the bright idea: "Why don't we go sledding at Ragdon Farm?" Advance reported back: The popular Amherst slope was packed with kids and their parents making merry in the snow. A New Hampshire moment, take off the coat and tie, put on the windbreaker—yeah! The locals had been pining for just such a photo op. The Texans thought this had to be a joke. You're saying the governor should spend his final campaign day . . . SLEDDING? "Sure, let's do it," Bush grinned. Upward of a thousand people were crawling across the slope that crisp afternoon when the caravan settled in along the highway. State troopers converged, their bellows parried by the irresistible force of Texas Rangers plowing a swath for the governor, his wife, his parents, and his daughters. At the top of the hill, a couple of kids were led to the candidate. Bush introduced himself, shook their hands. Then he challenged them to a race. Mounting his sled, the governor took off downhill. The snow had hardened into a carpet of ice. Bush zoomed ahead of his two fellow sledders, losing as well his daughters and the advance team, jubilant even as he grimaced against the cold. Reporters in pursuit fell on their asses. The Rangers, positioned near the bottom of the slope, watched Bush fly past them and then stumbled after their boss in their cowboy boots. Bush rose from his sled. Sure enough, he had been the first one down. "Let's go again!" he exulted . . . then was reminded, in the gentlest possible words, that in sixteen hours, people would be standing in line to vote on whether George W. Bush—fine downhill sledder and pancake flipper though he may be—had what it took to be president of the United States of America. The Bush campaign wrapped up the day's activity at a candlepin bowling alley in Nashua. That evening, Americans in the Granite State and beyond took in the televised spectacle of the two leading Republican presidential contenders. There was John McCain, the master of the town hall, being mobbed in Peterborough, delirious followers hanging from the balcony like schoolboys; McCain the war hero at a rally in Portsmouth, serenaded by the horn of a mighty naval vessel. And there was George W. Bush, the president's son, sledding and bowling. "You ready to win tonight?" the governor called out early the next morning, February 1, 2000, to one of his advance guys, who thought, Not a freaking chance. Bush wanted to believe it. Rove tried to believe it. The New Hampshire lieutenants like Maiola could not, even in their wildest delusions, believe it, figuring nonetheless that the margin of defeat would be 4, perhaps 5. . . . The first exit polls came in around noon. Studying them, McCain's strategist John Weaver murmured, "They can't be true." Hearing them from Rove over Chinese food, Mark McKinnon replied, "Oh, shit." Receiving them by phone, Joel Maiola turned to Pat Griffin and informed him, "We're getting killed." Wolfeboro, six months ago the site of the Bush couple's Tolkien-like arrival by boat at a shoreline swelling with worshippers . . . had swung to McCain by a margin of 21. Both sides figured the numbers had to be off. Which they were. The next wave of numbers came in: McCain by 19. "Are you sure?" That was Bush, sitting in his suite at the Merrimack Residence Inn, the expression on his face matching his words. Karl Rove had been the deliverer, a task no sane man would have relished. Rove indicated that yes, he was sure. Bush was at a loss for words. His ordinary reflex action, lashing out at his two favorite targets, Rove (because he usually had it coming) and his bodyman Logan Walters (who never did, but who just always happened to be handy)—What the hell do you mean, why wasn't this done, give me a goddamn straight answer—did not fit the present circumstances. No. A complete and total humiliation . . . he couldn't point fingers. He couldn't hide, any more than he could quit. He sat there in the suite for a while with his wife—watching, sort of, the Weather Channel. It was Laura who first spoke up. And when she did, people tended to listen, since the former librarian largely kept to her parallel universe. Never scheduling herself into policy meetings, always deferring—or simply shutting it all out, as when five staffers and the Bushes crammed into a tiny plane for an event in Albuquerque, and in the middle of a gin rummy game heavy on profane trash-talking, there sat the First Lady of Texas with her face in a book. "You got defined," she now told her husband. Her tone wasn't sympathetic. "And you need to make up your mind whether or not you're going to go down there and tell people who you are. Instead of letting people define you." Bush didn't argue with her. He preferred the Merrimack hotel for its environs, which were better suited for jogging than the downtown alternatives. Today, however, it was freezing, and in any event the governor needed to sweat somewhere out of public view. The Rangers drove him to a strip-mall gym. Huffing on a treadmill in his sweats, the plainclothes emblem of middle-age stress—Bush gave himself that hour to pity and punish and reconstruct himself. Then he showered and instructed his Rangers to take him back to the hotel. There he marshaled his Texans—Rove, Karen Hughes with her teenage son, Robert, McKinnon, Blakeman, a few others—and explained to them what all of this meant. "We're going to lose today," Bush told them. "Look, if anybody wants to blame someone, blame me. I don't want anybody blaming anyone in New Hampshire. These people did a good job for us. We're gonna need them in the general." He said to Karen, "Draft a statement. I want it to be a celebratory statement." Surveying the pallor of their expressions, Bush was more emphatic: "This thing ain't over. We're gonna fight, okay? Don't let 'em smell defeat when you walk out there. People are gonna read your body language." The governor was still working on his. In his suite at the Nashua Crowne Plaza, John McCain stood beside a window, rehearsing the victory speech Mark Salter had written for him. Weaver and Salter entered the room, handed him the 5:00 p.m. exit polls. McCain had left that final rally in Peterborough last night confident that he would win. Five points, eight points. But these crazy numbers . . . Studying them, the senator said quietly, "This has . . . implications." "Uh . . . like you might be president?" ventured Salter. McCain smiled. He turned his gaze toward the window for a moment. Then he looked back down at his speech. Later, McCain's press secretary Todd Harris received a call from a friendly reporter in the Bush camp. The Bush people, she told Harris, were asking around for a line to McCain. He passed on the number of the senator's pollster, Bill McInturff, whose phone then rang. "Rove's on the phone," McInturff announced. "Tell him consultants don't concede," scoffed Weaver. A second call came through. It was the governor. Cindy McCain was crying as her husband took the phone. Sharing this historic moment with Cindy and McCain's inner circle were, fittingly, a handful of thoroughly embedded reporters like Jake Tapper and Tucker Carlson, along with a clutch of liquored-up veterans. In times of crushing malaise or irrational exuberance, McCain and his fellow POWs fell back on an old sailor's admonition: Steady strain, boys. Steady strain. Accordingly, the rope line of his emotions stayed just slightly taut as he listened to the governor—his expression less that of a victor than of a man on the phone with his insurance agent. "Okay, George. Okay. See you in South Carolina. Thank you, George. Okay. Goodbye, George." Doing what she did best, Karen spent the afternoon spinning a rhetorical web of gold in her draft of the concession speech: The road to the Republican nomination is a long road. Mine will go through all fifty states, and I intend it to end at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. . . . Doing what he did best, Rove placed a conference call to the South Carolina offices before the news had hit the wires: "The governor's taken responsibility for it. We made some mistakes, but we're gonna regroup. And you're gonna help us do it." Doing what he did best that night at Saint Anselm College's not-Victory Party, Joe Allbaugh took note of the spread of food that no one had mustered the appetite to devour and thereupon chewed out a young staffer for her profligate spending. And doing what had been bred in his bones, George W. Bush, having been dealt a 50–32 drubbing, wound down that miserable evening in a state of Bushian graciousness as he spoke to the local faithful one by one: "You're a good man." "You guys worked your asses off. We're gonna pull this together." "I'm gonna learn, I'm gonna get better." "You go out and buy yourself a red dress and come to Washington, because we're gonna win." What a guy—he knew just the right things to say. It meant so much to them. But did it mean anything else?  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
