Tim Abromaitis had 25 points, Tyrone Nash scored 18 and Notre Dame rallied from a 12-point halftime deficit for an 89-83 double-overtime victory over Georgia on Thursday night in the opening round of the Old Spice Classic in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. “What a Thanksgiving for Notre Dame fans,” Notre Dame Coach Mike Brey said. “They probably threw up some turkey around the country. I’m really proud of our group. Fifth game of the season, to be up against the wall and find a way to fight it out and get a win. Something for us to really build on.” The Irish (5-0) held the Bulldogs scoreless for more than six minutes in the second half, using a 14-0 run  to force overtime. Travis Leslie had 23 points and Trey Thompkins finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds  for Georgia (3-1). Thompkins, Georgia’s leading scorer and rebounder last season, missed the first three games with a high ankle sprain.
