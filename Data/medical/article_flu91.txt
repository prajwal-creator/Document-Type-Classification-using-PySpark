Randy Jones of the Mets did not particularly need any reminder that fame can be brief. Twice a 20-game winner, once the winner of the Cy Young Award as the best pitcher in the National League, he is 32 years old and fighting for his job. Like the Pirates, he had not won much since 1979. He did not win today, either. But he pitched five good innings against the Pirates, who capitalized on two wild pickoff throws, by Jones and Jesse Orosco, for a 4-0 victory. It was the sixth loss in nine exhibition games for the Mets, who managed only two hits Thursday against the St. Louis Cardinals and only three today. Not only that, but George Foster and Scott Holman came down with the flu, Orosco surrendered six hits in two innings, and most of the jobs on the team were still open with only 16 days left in spring training. Few Positions Are Set   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''I know I've got Hubie Brooks set at third base,'' said Manager George Bamberger, ''and Dave Kingman at first, and John Stearns as the catcher and Foster in left field. But everything else is wide open. Everybody on the pitching staff has got to win a job, including Randy Jones.''  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Jones, making his second start of the spring, probably helped himself in his struggle to survive. Since becoming a star with the San Diego Padres, he has suffered repeated injuries and, in the last two years, won only six games and lost 21. After joining the Mets one year ago, he won one game, lost eight and completed none. ''For the last couple of years,'' he said before pitching today, ''I've been thinking about my injuries and a lot of things. I lost full concentration. I lost the tunnel vision you need to home plate.  Am I trying to impress the manager? Sure, and I'm also trying to impress myself.'' In his debut last week, Jones worked four innings in lots of traffic: five hits and two walks. He started badly this afternoon, too, walking Omar Moreno and letting Lee Lacy beat out a bunt. Then he tried to pick Lacy off first base, threw the ball into the runner and Moreno scored. Later, Bill Madlock made the score 2-0 on a single to shortstop. But Jones struck out the side and escaped major trouble.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address.

He also struck out Moreno with the bases loaded in the fourth and got 12 of his 15 outs either by strikeouts or infield grounders. Jones Adds a Screwball ''I'm getting there,'' he said afterward. ''Late last season, when I was in the doghouse, I started learning how to throw a screwball.  Mike Marshall showed me. Now I'm getting it over for strikes. There's no question I feel that I threw some good pitches past some good hitters.'' Orosco, supposedly the left-handed stopper of the bullpen, had no such luck. He also made a wild pickoff throw for one run, and another crossed on a single by Johnny Ray. In three appearances, Orosco has been reached for 16 hits and nine runs in eight innings. ''In the next two weeks,'' Bamberger said, ''we've got to decide who plays where on almost the whole team. Except for those four or five guys, everything's wide open.'' Bamberger got no clues from a B game in the morning in St.Petersburg, where the Mets lost, 10-7, to the St. Louis Cardinals.  The best work was done by Mookie Wilson, who got three hits and stole three bases and who will probably open in center field. ---- Expos Shut Out Yankees Special to the New York Times WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., March 19 - The Yankees lost by 2-0 to the Montreal Expos today. The defeat was the Yankees' eighth in 11 exhibition games. With none out in the seventh inning and the Expos leading, 2-0, Ken Griffey doubled deep to right field and Lou Piniella singled. Both were retired, though, on Graig Nettles's grounder to first base - Griffey at the plate and Piniella at third base.

Jerry Mumphrey was an earlier casualty because of a sore back. Dave Righetti went five innings and allowed two runs on seven hits.    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
