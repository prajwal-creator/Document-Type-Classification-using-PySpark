Over the course of the next several years, the man who made ballet a modern art enshrined the woman who would become his fifth wife in a series of roles that bear her imprint to this day. Since his arrival in America in 1933, journalists had been asking Balanchine what constituted the ideal body for a dancer. He replied that he was looking for long legs, a strong back, light bones (''like a bird's'') and a small head. In his other ballerinas he had found two -- maybe three -- of those qualities; in Tanaquil Le Clercq he hit the jackpot. When the New York City Ballet commemorates its 50th anniversary with a tribute to Le Clercq this Tuesday, opening night of its fall season, the audience will be transported back to those early years, with the same program that the company performed at its debut: ''Concerto Barocco''; ''Symphony in C,'' in which Le Clercq -- then 19 -- danced the breathtaking adagio; and ''Orpheus,'' in which she led the Bacchantes. It was an exhilarating time. Balanchine's longstanding dream -- of creating a company that would dance in a new style and serve as his instrument -- was at last becoming a reality: his fledgling New York City Ballet was installed at the City Center, and the first generation of students at his School of American Ballet, established 14 years before, had come of age. Among them was Le Clercq, whom, in restrospect, we can now identify as the prototype for that exquisite thoroughbred the Balanchine dancer. Her elegant lyricism and her physique, attenuated and strong, set the precedent for a series of roles that occupy center stage in Balanchine's vast repertory. The line of succession, from Le Clercq through Allegra Kent and Suzanne Farrell to Darci Kistler, is direct. As her former colleagues and other alumni assemble on the stage of the New York State Theater, Le Clercq will watch the opening-night proceedings from the audience, in the wheelchair to which she has been confined since 1956, when, on tour with the New York City Ballet in Denmark, she contracted polio. She refuses to be photographed and over the years has denied requests for interviews. But in a series of conversations this fall at her home in Connecticut, a modest prefab bungalow that she and Balanchine built, Le Clercq recounted her experience.

Her hair is blond now, her skin still pale. Her vivacious intelligence and the sharpness of her wit animate the conversation. I write this not only as a journalist but also as a friend of some 17 years. And so it is with a sense of relief and delight that I have witnessed her obligation to ballet history win out, however briefly, over her longstanding insistence on her privacy. ''And then I'll lapse back into obscurity,'' she says dryly.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Tanaquil Le Clercq's career got off to an early start when in 1946 Balanchine tapped her to dance a leading role in a new ballet called ''Four Temperaments,'' which he was making for Ballet Society, an ad hoc company assembled for a few performances in the auditorium of the Central High School of Needle Trades. She was still a student. If ''Four Temperaments'' has gone down in the annals of modernism as one of the great, groundbreaking ballets of its time -- a so-called leotard ballet, clean and stark -- it is no thanks to the costumes and sets Kurt Seligmann designed for the original production. ''I don't know how anybody saw what it looked like, frankly, with all that junk on top,'' Le Clercq says. ''We all had wigs. I had a hip-length blue wig with a horn in the middle, like a unicorn. And then there were wings, which completely encased the fingers. Well, it was the most awful, suffocating thing, having all 10 fingers wrapped up. Anyway, I was crying -- I always cried a lot. And Mr. B. came over and said: 'What's the matter? What's the matter?' I said: 'Oh, I'm trapped. I haven't got my fingers -- I can't do anything!' And he was very clever. He made a little slit with a scissor, and I put my middle finger through, so that the wings looked like they were right there on top of my hand, but I had this one finger that I could use for undoing my toe shoe or whatever I needed to do. So I fell in love right then and there, if I hadn't been before.'' Le Clercq was born on Oct. 2, 1929, in Paris, and named for an Etruscan queen of Rome. Until her arrival in New York at the age of 3, she spoke only French, which she promptly abandoned in order to fit in with other children. She also acquired an American-sounding nickname: Tanny. Her father, Jacques Le Clercq, a poet and short-story writer, settled into a career as a university professor and a translator of French literature. Her mother, born Edith Whittemore, a St. Louis debutante whose own ambitions to dance had been frustrated by her parents, enrolled Tanny in ballet classes. At 10, Tanny auditioned for a scholarship at the School of American Ballet. ''This was an open competition,'' she recalls. ''They put a number on you, front and back, so they could see you coming and going. So I had my number -- I remember it was 64. I had my tutu on, starched within an inch of its life, and I wore a headband with flowers from the 5-and-10 sewn all across the top, like I was some grand ballerina. Luckily, Muriel Stuart'' -- a former dancer with Anna Pavlova and a teacher at the school -- ''gave the class, and I had a head start, because I'd taken a summer course with her on Cape Cod. She probably gave me all the steps we were going to do. Well, I'm sure she just threw it my way. And I won.'' When did Le Clercq first become aware that Balanchine was paying attention to her as a dancer? ''Hmm, I don't know,'' she replies. ''It happened so slowly.'' Did he give her more corrections? ''No, fewer. When he taught class, I'd be the last one he'd correct.'' A sign, perhaps, that she was doing more things right than everyone else? ''Well, I wasn't. Maybe it was just that everybody else was a little worse. But if I was so good, then you would think he must have liked me. And every other teacher, if they liked you, always paid attention to you. But I could not get his attention. The only way would be to make a terrible mistake. Everyone would go right, and I'd go to the left -- then he'd wake up and see I was there. It was infuriating. ''Once he called me in and scolded me with my friend Margie McGee. I was such an idiot, I thought he was going to compliment us, because she was so pretty, with long legs and feet, and my teachers said I was doing well. So, the way he is -- very quiet, gentle -- he said: 'I have something to tell you. It's terrible what you're doing, terrible.' Margie burst into tears, I silently cried. And he said: 'You pay no attention to anything. The teachers are giving corrections, you're both talking. Especially you' -- he pointed at me -- 'you talk through the whole class. And you must stop mocking your teachers.' I said to myself: It's true -- all I do is talk talk talk talk talk. And really, that imitation of Stuart wasn't such a good idea. The unfortunate thing is, I thought he was right.'' In time, Balanchine's disregard, whether real or feigned, gave way to outright interest: he chose Le Clercq to perform in a lecture-demonstration and a benefit; he cast her in his new ballets. Eventually there were signs that the interest was more than merely professional. For her part, Le Clercq loved the way he stood, the way he smelled; ''elegant'' is the word she returns to repeatedly as she describes him. The ''sculpting of his jaw'' reminded her of Gary Cooper. Balanchine, however, was still married to Maria Tallchief, his fourth wife and the first among equals when it came to the company's ballerinas, a technical dynamo with exotic features. (His first three wives were also dancers: Tamara Geva, Alexandra Danilova and Vera Zorina.) Le Clercq dated around and became engaged to a composer.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In 1950, the company went to England; in Manchester and Liverpool, Le Clercq found herself rooming with Tallchief, while Balanchine was by himself. ''When we came back,'' Le Clercq says, ''they got separated -- Maria got an apartment. And I started seriously going with George. After a year, they got an annulment, because Maria wanted to have babies. In one of the newspapers, I remember, there was a picture of Maria'' -- who is half American Indian -- ''and George with the headline 'No Papooses.''' Le Clercq's mother chaperoned her dates with Balanchine, who was then in his mid-40's, until a year or so later she moved out on her own. In 1952, at Christmastime, she and Balanchine exchanged gifts at her apartment. ''We were sitting on the floor,'' she says. ''George gave me a camera, a beautiful handbag and a Steuben glass vase. And then he proposed. 'Do you want to marry me?' And I said, 'Yes!' He was shocked. He said: 'Well, don't you want to think it over? I mean, I'm much older than you are.' 'I know that,' I said. 'Well,' he said, 'I think you should ask your mother.' I said: 'There's no reason to ask my mother. I'm old enough, and yes, I'll marry you!' What's to think over? I was crazy about him. So we got married on New Year's Eve -- he specially picked the date so we'd start the new year married.'' They set up housekeeping in a first-floor apartment at 41 East 75th Street. The decor was modern, with furniture bought at the Museum of Modern Art, two pianos and a fireplace. Every morning at 8, Barbara Karinska, the company's costume designer, called and talked to Balanchine for 20 minutes; he gave her advice. Le Clercq got up at 9. ''He would fix me coffee and hand me a zwieback,'' she recalls. ''I was used to my mother's freshly squeezed orange juice, two four-minute eggs, two pieces of white, crustless buttered bread, four slices of crispy bacon and Ovaltine -- that was breakfast, not strong coffee and a dry zwieback. But, hey, I could adapt. ''I went off to class and left George in the kitchen, in his kimono. After class, I would see him in the studio, ready to rehearse. Or if we didn't rehearse, he'd pick me up and we'd go out for lunch at Longchamps. In the evening, we'd go to the movies on 42d Street, a double feature -- we'd sit up in the balcony, so we could smoke, and puff away. He loved science fiction and westerns.'' Contrary to what most people might imagine, there was no music at home. Balanchine did not play the piano, unless it was to study some passage in a score that he was choreographing. He loved to wash and iron. He took a carpentry course and built a toolshed, a bookcase, two chests, two night stands, three bars. He was also an adventurous cook, often trying to duplicate something he had eaten in a restaurant -- sole wrapped in a lettuce leaf or a prune souffle. Among his specialties was what Le Clercq calls ''a fake dessert'' -- Mallomars melted under the broiler. In order to preserve his culinary reputation, he would hide the evidence in the garbage before the guests arrived. When Tallchief was married to Balanchine, she addressed him as ''George'' in the studio; the other dancers called him ''Mr. B.'' Le Clercq says that to her, in professional circumstances he was always ''Mr. B.'' Even now, when she speaks of him, she naturally slips back and forth between George the man and Balanchine the genius. Her love for him apparently consisted of equal parts passion and admiration, with the intimacy they shared giving way on occasion to the distance that awe creates. One minute he's doing the laundry; the next he's making ''Agon.'' In his relationships with his ballerinas, particularly with his wives, Balanchine has often been portrayed as a Pygmalion-like manipulator, dictating his muses' personalities -- a view that fails to take into account the collaborative nature of the form in which he worked. Unlike Picasso's depictions of Dora Maar, which are necessarily subjective, Balanchine's renderings of Le Clercq required not only her inspiration but also her active participation. The roles he made for her exploit her beauty, her sophistication, her intelligence, her sense of humor. They are, it seems, the product of acute observation and profound adoration.

And I thought I was good in semi-jazz, like 'Ivesiana.' I thought I was good in 'Afternoon of a Faun.''' Both ''The Concert'' and ''Afternoon of a Faun'' were Jerome Robbins ballets. ''When Jerry made something on you, it was a cinch. He played to your idiosyncrasies. Every twitch. Which was so good for the morale. Unlike Balanchine's roles, which made you think that your performance wasn't good enough, that it would never be good enough.

What was the quarter that was missing? ''Oh, the balance,'' she says. ''He'd done it in Paris for Tamara Toumanova, and she was one of those dancers that you couldn't knock off pointe. That famous story -- she's balancing, somebody goes out of the room to take a phone call, comes back and she's still balancing. So the role was handed to me from this fantastic balancer. You do a la seconde, you let go of his hand, you don't immediately grab for the next support, because he's not there yet. So you balance -- one potato, two potato, three potato, four potato, five potato, boom -- then you take his hand. Or, you put both arms up above your head, you turn -- still no partner. All these things Balanchine showed me, and I couldn't do them, let's face it, and he said, 'It's all right, it doesn't matter, I'll change it.' 'But it does matter,' I used to insist. 'It's what you wanted.' He tried to make it easier. But no, I wanted to do it the original way -- it's my stubbornness. So I did, but I was always scared. Now I go to the ballet, and what he suggested I could do -- they're doing it. It's not a big balancing act, and it works fine. Oh, I could kick myself.'' In a series of bootleg film fragments -- all silent -- that record Le Clercq's performance in ''La Valse,'' the choreography is so indelible and her rendition so vivid that they recreate Ravel's music in the mind of the viewer. The ballet's story -- the macabre account of a girl's first ball, where, caught up in the glamorous frenzy, she is literally danced to death -- unfolds in a series of events that are at once horrific and heart-rending. A stranger, dressed in black, enters and offers her black jewels, a black coat, long evening gloves, black roses. '''Put on the necklace and look in the mirror,' Balanchine told me. Well, there are lots of ways of putting on a necklace and looking at yourself in a mirror. 'Put your hands in the gloves,' he said.'' In the film, Le Clercq throws her head back and plunges her hands -- first the right, then the left -- into the gloves. ''I had my way of doing it, almost as if you welcomed death. Somebody else could do it another way. He gave you the leeway to do it with a little personality. Which some people might find surprising, because he's so often accused of eliminating the personality.'' When it came to technique, Balanchine's demands were more precise. ''When he really started to buckle down,'' Le Clercq recalls, ''was in 1950, before we went to London. That's when he decided to teach his principals. Before that, we had just warmed up. But from then on, we had company class on the stage. An hour and a half, no piano, just him beating time. And that was hell. But boy, he gets you that way, forcing you to concentrate on the noise your feet make when you land -- ta-ta-dah, ta-ta-dah, tia-bah tia-bah. Once you take his classes, it ruins you for everyone else's.'' In the summer of 1956, the New York City Ballet departed on an 11-week European tour. The company's renown was by then worldwide. In Paris, Le Clercq was hailed as its reigning ballerina, a rising talent who demonstrated the consolidation of the company's style. On Oct. 28 -- a Sunday -- in Copenhagen, Le Clercq danced the matinee, despite feeling as if she were coming down with the flu. Between performances her body ached so badly that she lay down on the floor of her dressing room. That evening she danced ''Bourree Fantasque,'' as scheduled, but switched movements with Diana Adams. ''I did the second,'' Le Clercq says, ''which was slower and, I thought, easier than to crash in with the fan and do the fast stuff. Then I went back to the hotel, and I still wasn't feeling well, but I was still walking.'' She woke up Monday morning no better. ''And then it just happened,'' she recalls. ''The legs went.'' She was seated, and she couldn't get up. ''Thighs wouldn't work.'' A doctor was summoned, and she left the hotel on a stretcher. The diagnosis was initially inconclusive. She was quarantined in the event that she had meningitis. Two days later she was moved to Blegdems Hospital, which specialized in polio. When the company left for Stockholm, Balanchine stayed behind. Le Clercq's recollections of those few weeks are dim; she remembers being in an iron lung. ''I thought it was cozy -- back to the mother's womb, I guess. It was warm, and it breathed with this hissing noise that never stopped.'' Articles in the press back home brought her fans up to date on her progress, reassuring them that she would recover and dance again. ''That was the thing to say,'' Le Clercq recalls. ''George said it, too: 'She's coming back, she exercises and she will be on her feet.''' When did Le Clercq know that she would never walk again? ''I knew immediately,'' she says. The Queen of Denmark came to visit and, learning that Tanaquil was an Etruscan name, talked to her for half an hour about Etruria. ''Smart cookie,'' Le Clercq says. Georg Jensen named a new silver pattern ''Tanaquil.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Balanchine staged one of his ballets, ''Serenade,'' for the Royal Danish Ballet and, out of gratitude for the treatment she was receiving, waived his royalties. In the evenings, he and Le Clercq's doctor would go out drinking. As deep as Balanchine's distress must have been, he hid it from her. ''We didn't discuss it,'' Le Clercq replies. ''I know that that's when he stopped smoking. One day in the hospital, he wanted to kiss me, and I said, 'Ooh, you don't smell good -- why do you smell like that?' Not a very nice thing to say. And he said, 'Oh, I've been smoking.' He never smoked again.'' The Salk vaccine had been available since 1954 but was still new enough that it was not entirely trusted. Le Clercq and Balanchine had discussed whether to get inoculated before leaving for Europe and decided against it on the basis of recent news reports about some people in New Jersey who were given a vaccine in which the virus was still active and got a mild case of the disease. In an eerie and astonishingly explicit foreshadowing of subsequent events, Balanchine had choreographed a ballet for a March of Dimes benefit a decade earlier and cast Le Clercq, still a student, in the lead. To the mournful strains of Mozart's String Quintet in G minor, she danced and then, touched by the ''Threat of Polio'' -- played by Balanchine himself, dressed in black -- she collapsed to the floor. During the adagio, seated in a wheelchair, she performed plaintive movements with her arms and upper body. In the finale, showered with dimes, she got up and danced again. Deeply mystical, Balanchine was troubled by the nagging suspicion that he had somehow brought on the fate that befell Le Clercq in real life. Back in New York, Le Clercq and Balanchine moved into an apartment in an elevator building on the West Side and embarked on a new phase in their life together: his daily routine now revolved around cultivating other dancers, and hers around trying to regain the slightest control over her legs and her right arm by means of physical therapy and massage. ''At first, George said that everything was going to be fine, and then he didn't bother saying it anymore,'' Le Clercq says. Instead, he would look out the window and point to the people on the street. ''Look at all those people walking,'' he would tell her, ''and they're miserable.'' He talked to her about the new ballets he was making -- ''Liebeslieder Walzer,'' ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' -- and urged her to go to performances. ''I didn't want to,'' Le Clercq says. In 1962, he brought home Patricia McBride, who took over the lead in ''La Valse,'' so that Le Clercq could teach her the role. ''He had no feelings that I would be upset about that,'' Le Clercq recalls. And was she? ''Yes. Slightly, yeah. On the other hand, how is she going to learn? He'd forgotten it, and she's such a sweet girl -- she did a great job. So when you think of it, he's right.'' In 1967, enamored of Suzanne Farrell, his new ballerina, Balanchine left Le Clercq. The public was scandalized, with many ballet fans professing indignation on Le Clercq's behalf. (Two years later, Farrell married her former classmate Paul Mejia, and they left for Europe.) ''I think the reason George and I were 14 years together was the polio,'' Le Clercq says. ''I really think he was honorable. Well, why else would he stay?'' Perhaps he stayed because he loved her? ''Well, but he wasn't like that,'' she insists. ''You see people married for so long -- sometimes it works, but then sometimes it doesn't. If you switch people, say, you get a whole different life. I think it renewed him, it gave him air. That's what I mean about being replenished. Some people don't have to be. Some do, and I think he did.'' Balanchine kept in touch, visiting from time to time. When Le Clercq began to teach at the Dance Theater of Harlem, he came by at her request to tell her how to go about it. ''He called me when we got divorced, crying,'' Le Clercq recalls. ''Nice. By then I didn't care as much, thank God. 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry,' he said. It was maybe the second time I've known him to cry.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Six years after she left, Farrell asked to come back. Balanchine called Le Clercq: Farrell had written him a letter, and she wanted to do ''La Valse.'' ''Well,'' Le Clercq thought, ''why not 'Don Quixote' or 'Meditation?''' -- both roles that had been made for Farrell. ''Anyway,'' Le Clercq continues, ''she would come back without the husband -- he wouldn't be in the company. I was big enough to say, 'Take her back.' Because at some point, you have to tell what you really think, no matter what. And I think she was terrific, and when she left there was a gap. There were nice dancers but not of her caliber, and I think he needed her.'' Fourteen years ago, when PBS broadcast a documentary about Balanchine and his work, Le Clercq tuned in and watched herself dance ''Concerto Barocco'' and ''Western Symphony'' -- an experience her friends seemed to find more poignant than she did. By that time, she insisted, she had been ''sitting'' longer than she had been ''standing,'' and besides, her colleagues had all retired. Even if she hadn't contracted polio, she said philosophically, she would no longer be dancing. In the intervening years she has written the autobiography of her cat, Mourka, whom Balanchine trained to do dance steps, compiled the favorite recipes of her dancer friends in a cookbook and invented crossword puzzles (some published in The New York Times). Ferociously independent, she lives alone. ''I had dreams in the beginning, for years,'' she says, ''of going to the theater and discovering I'd forgotten my toe shoes, or rushing from one ballet to another and not being able to get my hair up. Anxiety dreams about all the horrible things that could happen to you as a dancer -- when I couldn't even dance anymore. I outgrew those dreams eventually. Well, it was a hundred years ago. But when I dream now, I'm still walking, never wheeling. I know.'' She rolls her eyes. ''After all this time, you'd think I'd get the message.'' ''You were always changing into something else,'' Frank O'Hara wrote in a poem about Le Clercq, ''and always will be/always plumage, perfection's broken heart, wings.'' Le Clercq's legend persists, intertwined with Balanchine's. His other ballerinas claim that they danced not so much for the audience as for him. ''Of course, I danced the way he wanted me to,'' Le Clercq says, ''and I wanted to please him. But the truth is, I danced for myself. Because it felt so good to dance well.''
