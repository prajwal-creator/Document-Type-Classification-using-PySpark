He returned this year with a portable device to measure carbon monoxide and the hope of winning another gold medal. Mr. Hooker, who attends Benjamin E. Mays High School in Atlanta, is among nearly 1,000 black high school students from around the United States who have placed in the finals of the 10th annual Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics, sponsored by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The students gathered over the weekend at the Sheraton Centre hotel in Manhattan to try to make their mark in events ranging from musical composition and playwrighting to biology and computer science. Counterpoint to Athletics   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''Students around the nation are constantly reminded of the athletic accomplishments of blacks,'' Mr. Hooker said between explanations of his chemistry project, ''but those who are brilliant in the academic fields rarely get that type of recognition. This competition brings the focus to the academics for a change.''

Nearly $70,000 in prizes will be awarded today to the 66 students who receive the gold, silver and bronze medals that reflect the Olympic spirit of the event. In addition some of the competition's nearly 300 corporate sponsors will provide bonuses: the Ronald McDonald's Children's Charities will match each $1,000 check awarded to the gold medalists; the Digital Equipment Corporation will give personal computers to 10 outstanding contestants, and the Black Buick Dealers of America will give $10,000 to the top science winner. The competition began Saturday with musical compositions, dance performances and dramatic monologues. It resumed yesterday with some students singing assorted selections, from opera to country ballads, and others participating in oratory contests.

''I am amazed that such work exists,'' said Denver Moss, an 18-year-old aspiring artist from Baltimore who sat beside an oversized self-portrait. ''I look at this art and I'm inspired.'' Many of the participating students agreed that the exposure to work by other young people was the competition's most valuable reward. Other participants said the recognition and reinforcement they received at the competition inspired them to reach for even higher goals. Amaoge Okoye, 16, who just graduated from Amityville (L.I.) High School and plans to become a psychologist, attended the competition last year to play the flute for her sister who was entered as a composer. ''I saw someone's psychology project and I thought, 'I can do that,' '' Miss Okoye said. ''I made it my goal that I was going to get here.'' Feeling 'Like Somebody' She created a program that used video games to improve the reading skills of young children. ''When I was growing up, I was taught by other kids not to show that I had brains,'' Miss Okoye said. ''But they think I'm good enough to be here, and that really makes me feel like somebody.''
