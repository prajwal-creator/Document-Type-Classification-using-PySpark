Credit Justin Sullivan/Getty Images     European health authorities have made two significant changes to the label of an emergency contraception pill that is equivalent to Plan B One-Step. One of the changes could be relevant to two cases that the Supreme Court  added to its docket on Tuesday. The new label of the drug, Norlevo, says it “cannot stop a fertilized egg from attaching to the womb,” contradicting a claim by some abortion opponents that has fueled their objections to the Affordable Care Act. The new label also warns that Norlevo loses effectiveness in women weighing more than 165 pounds and does not work in women over 176 pounds. Norlevo is not sold in the United States, but Plan B One-Step and two generic versions are identical to it. This year, the Food and Drug Administration made Plan B One-Step available to people of all ages without a prescription.

The cases are based on the claim that some types of contraception, including Plan B One-Step, prevent fertilized eggs from implanting in the womb, tantamount to an abortion.

Last year, The New York Times reported that scientific studies provided strong evidence that levonorgestrel does not block implantation. References to the possibility of blocking implantation were then removed from the websites of the National Institutes of Health and the Mayo Clinic. And an F.D.A. spokeswoman, Erica Jefferson, said that “the emerging data on Plan B suggest that it does not inhibit implantation.” On Tuesday, Ms. Jefferson reiterated that view. The drug agency has not moved to change the label, saying manufacturers must request a change. Plan B One-Step’s manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals, declined to comment. It had previously said scientific evidence suggested that the pill did not disrupt implantation. Ms. Jefferson also said that the drug agency was reviewing the scientific information concerning the effect of weight on the pills’ effectiveness. The European label change regarding weight, reported on Monday by Mother Jones , stemmed from a 2011 study.

While there is no data on the percentage of overweight or obese women who use emergency contraception, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that, from 2007 to 2010, the average weight of women age 20 and over was 166.2 pounds. For non-Hispanic black women, the average weight was 187.9 pounds. Experts said women over 165 pounds should use either a copper intrauterine device or a different pill, Ella, made by HRA Pharma. Those methods are not as easy to obtain, however, because the device must be inserted and Ella requires a prescription. A small amount of data also suggests that Ella may not work well in very obese women, said Erin Gainer, HRA Pharma’s chief executive. Initially, the 2011 study was not designed to look at weight, but was intended to compare data on different types of emergency contraception.

She added, “We felt we needed to take the results to regulators and update the product label to get this information to consumers.” Scientists said they did not yet know why weight would diminish levonorgestrel’s effectiveness. “Most drugs are affected by body weight, and there have been suggestions that other hormonal contraceptives, including the pill and the mini-pill, may have higher failure rates in obese women,” the lead author of the 2011 study, Dr. Anna Glasier, an honorary professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Edinburgh, said in an email. Diana Blithe, a biochemist overseeing contraception research for the National Institutes of Health, said some scientists think greater weight adversely affects how the drug is metabolized, while others say the drug simply spreads out more in larger people, diluting its effectiveness. More research is important, she said, because pregnancy can be risky to an obese person’s health, and levonorgestrel is valued because it is a very safe drug. Research has not established whether increased doses of levonorgestrel would work for very heavy women, Dr. Blithe said. But some health care providers have known for a while that the current pill may be ineffective for those women. Planned Parenthood already tells women with a body mass index over 30 that levonorgestrel is “not recommended,” said Karen Shea, its director of medical standards.
