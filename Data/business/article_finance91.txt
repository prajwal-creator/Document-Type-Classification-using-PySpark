Liu, even though he was not charged.   Credit John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times     Two former associates of John C. Liu, the New York City comptroller and a Democratic candidate for mayor, were convicted on Thursday for their roles in attempting to funnel money to the Liu campaign through an illegal fund-raising scheme. The verdicts, which came during the first full day of deliberations, were expected to render a public judgment on Mr. Liu, even though he was not charged with a crime and has maintained a defiant stand whenever asked about the trial or the inquiry. Mr. Liu said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened by the verdict,” but added that he would “continue to ask the voters for their support.” Speaking later on a Cobble Hill street corner after an evening forum for mayoral candidates, Mr. Liu repeatedly deflected questions about whether he took any responsibility, and said that he was proud of the way his campaign was conducted. “I’ve got nothing to hide,” he said. “I’ve got a clear conscience.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Yet throughout the trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, prosecutors sought to portray the Liu campaign as condoning, if not outright orchestrating, questionable practices designed to maximize fund-raising, and that the two defendants’ actions merely fit into a larger pattern.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Prosecutors had charged that the defendants, Jia Hou, a former Liu campaign treasurer, and Xing Wu Pan, a fund-raiser, relied on so-called straw donors — people whose contributions are reimbursed by others — to raise money and use some of it to obtain city matching funds. Mr. Pan was found guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and attempted wire fraud in relation to a straw-donor scheme. Ms. Hou, 26, was acquitted of conspiracy, but was convicted for her role in a straw-donor scheme. She was also found guilty of lying to federal agents and obstruction of justice. Most of the counts carry 20-year maximum terms, although the defendants seem likely to receive much less time. One juror said by phone that the deliberations had been collegial, that “everybody had a chance to speak,” and that there were “one or two people that had questions” early on. The verdict came after some seven hours of deliberations. Asked about a prosecutor’s claim in closing arguments that Mr. Liu had known of the illegal scheme, the juror, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, “It didn’t really matter to us.” “Nobody was influenced by anything about the politics side of things,” the juror said. “They were very serious crimes and we just wanted to treat it as such.” Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said Ms. Hou and Mr. Pan “stuck a knife into the heart of New York City’s campaign finance law by violating the prohibition against illegal campaign contributions.”  Photo        Xing Wu Pan   Credit John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times    A former boyfriend of Ms. Hou, for example, testified that she offered to reimburse him if he contributed $500 to the campaign in July 2011, a time when Liu aides were trying to meet an internal $1 million fund-raising goal.

Mr. Kong was actually an undercover F.B.I. agent who recorded his discussions with Mr. Pan and even captured a video of Mr. Liu hugging Mr. Pan as the comptroller arrived at the event. “I want to see you ... as the next mayor,” the undercover agent told Mr. Liu at the event, according to a transcript introduced at trial. At one point, Mr. Pan tells Mr. Liu that the function is “Richard’s event,” which Mr. Pan later told the Federal Bureau of Investigation was to signal that “Richard Kong” was behind the donations, although Mr. Pan said he was not sure Mr. Liu had taken his meaning that way. A prosecutor, Justin Anderson, said in a closing argument that Mr. Liu had to have understood Mr. Pan’s meaning, since Mr. Kong’s stated goal was to gain access to Mr. Liu. “It would defeat the whole purpose of the straw-donor scheme if the candidate doesn’t know where the money’s coming from,” Mr. Anderson said. The whole point, he said, was “to get credit for it.” Mr. Liu’s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, said on Tuesday that “there was not a shred of evidence at the trial or in the last three years that John Liu knew about any wrongdoing that might be connected to his campaign.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ms. Hou and Mr. Pan showed no emotion as the verdict was announced in court about 5 p.m. Afterward, Ms. Hou’s lawyer, Gerald B. Lefcourt, said: “We’re obviously very disappointed. We think it is an unjust verdict.” “Unfortunately, she got caught in the middle of an obsessive quest for John Liu that went on for five years and is apparently still going on,” he said. Mr. Pan’s lawyer, Irwin Rochman, echoing what he had said in his summation, called his client “collateral damage in the government’s war against John Liu.” Both lawyers said their clients would appeal. “There were complicated legal issues in the case, I think, that deserve consideration,” Mr. Rochman added. Judge Richard J. Sullivan said he would impose sentence on Sept. 20.   Reporting was contributed by Russ Buettner, David W. Chen, Alain Delaquérière, Javier C. Hernández and Jack Styczysnki.
