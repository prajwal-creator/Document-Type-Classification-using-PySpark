And most homes in the 2.76-square-mile unincorporated section of the town of Greenburgh even have Scarsdale ZIP codes. What is more, the two communities are often mentioned in the same breath when the subject of Westchester's top-performing schools comes up. So it may not be surprising that many people think Edgemont is part of Scarsdale. But they have distinct boundaries and, according to some accounts, dissimilar personalities. ''Edgemont is smaller and more intimate than Scarsdale,'' said Ruth M. Burger, an associate broker with Julia B. Fee Real Estate. ''And because it's perceived of as more laid back, some Edgemont residents sometimes fondly refer to it as 'Scarsdale lite.' '' As Michael Lalli, president of the Greenville Civic Association, which represents about 150 homes in Edgemont in the northern section on the Hartsdale border, said, ''To those of us who live here, there's a very clear difference between Edgemont and Scarsdale.'' Occupying a hilly pocket between the Sprain Brook Parkway to the west and the Bronx River Parkway to the east, Edgemont's Tudor and classic colonials (a few dating back to the 18th century) are about 22 miles from Midtown Manhattan, making it an appealing choice for commuters. It is a 32-minute trip to Grand Central on Metro-North from either the Scarsdale train station (which is walking distance from many parts of Edgemont) or the one in Hartsdale, where all Greenburgh residents are eligible for parking permits.

According to Linda Roth, the manager of Coldwell Banker Doernberg, ''You get more for your money across the board in Edgemont, in terms of price and house size.''  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       For many residents, however, Edgemont's main attraction is its public education system, with the community's neighborhoods defined by the boundaries of its two elementary schools: Seely Place and Greenville. Among other things, residents point proudly to a low student-teacher ratio -- about 21 to 1 in the elementary grades -- and the fact that 120 of the 125 students who graduated last year from Edgemont Junior-Senior High School went on to four-year colleges. WHEN Gerri and Andrew Sommers decided to move from their three-bedroom apartment on the East Side of Manhattan to a house in the suburbs, they first narrowed their search to Westchester. Mr. Sommers, a lawyer in Manhattan, wanted to be able to commute by train in and out of Grand Central Terminal, which is near his office, and that ruled out living in New Jersey or on Long Island, which are served by Penn Station. Then when the couple began searching in Westchester for a community with a high-achieving school system, Scarsdale and Edgemont came up on the radar screen. The latter won out for a number of reasons. Mrs. Sommers, a former hedge fund analyst who now stays at home with her two children, said she and her husband wanted a small school system. With fewer than 500 students in each of the two elementary schools and only 125 students in the 2003 graduating class at the junior-senior high school, Edgemont's school system is about one-third the size of Scarsdale's. In August, the family moved into a four-bedroom 1950's colonial. ''There's definitely a sense of neighborhood, of community in Edgemont,'' Mrs. Sommers said. ''It's exactly what we wanted and not too far away from the city. It's convenient to everything.'' Residents of Edgemont are within a short drive of at least of five supermarkets, in Scarsdale or on Central Park Avenue nearby, Mrs. Sommers noted. Also, in fewer than 10 minutes, Mrs. Sommers can wend her way through a number of back roads and reach a large shopping center in Yonkers that includes a Stew Leonard's Dairy Store and Costco, a discount warehouse outlet. But living in Edgemont comes at a high cost. Even though prices on homes are lower than those in Scarsdale, they are still higher than in most other areas of Westchester. The median sales price of a single family home in the unincorporated section of Greenburgh is $862,500. (In Scarsdale, that same house would sell for more than $962,000, real estate sales agents said.) For the county over all at the end of September, the median sales price was $588,250.

At the high end, a seven-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath colonial on 1.7 acres is listed at $2.185 million. Mr. Lalli, the president of the Greenville Civic Association, said that when he and his wife, Marigrace, were looking for a home 15 years ago, ''the tiebreaker between Edgemont and Scarsdale was finding the right house at the right price.'' ''But looking back now,'' he said, ''it's the schools that have made the real difference for us. We've been so happy to have a small system and to be so involved in it.''

Per-pupil costs last year were estimated at $15,325. The high school offers advanced placement courses in a number of subjects as well as a science scholars program, which enables students to pursue independent projects. It also has a debate team and a model United Nations program. In Grades 7 to 12, participation in athletics is widespread; 80 percent of the students take part on 53 different sports teams. In January 1999, U.S. News & World Report named Edgemont Junior-Senior High, which has 10 buildings on an 80-acre landscaped campus, as one of its ''examples of excellence'' for a suburban public school. The high school's average scores on the SAT reasoning tests last spring were an extraordinary 590 on the verbal test and 650 in math, said William J. Smith, principal of the junior-senior high school. Statewide average scores were 496 and 510, respectively. There were two National Merit scholars last year. At the elementary school level, 88 percent of fourth graders met or exceeded New York State standards for English language arts and 97 percent met or exceeded standards for math, according to Jane Gertler, director of curriculum and assessment. For those drawn to Edgemont's schools but at a lower price, there are condominiums and co-ops on Central Park Avenue. The 179 condo units in Edgemont are in two complexes: Scarsdale Woods and Scarsdale Meadows. And there are 625 co-ops at four developments: Scarsdale Country Estates, Scarsdale Ridge, the Edgemont and the Fountainhead.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Condo prices range from about $150,000 for a one-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath unit to about $450,000 for a two-bedroom with two baths, depending on the size of the unit and the complex, said Ms. Roth at Coldwell Banker Doernberg. The co-ops range from about $45,000 for a one-bedroom, one-bath to $200,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bath unit. WELL before it developed into a suburban area of commodious homes on well-landscaped lots -- and before Revolutionary War troops marched down what is now called Old Army Road -- Edgemont was home to Wecquaesgeek Indians, a subtribe of the Wappingers. According to a booklet written by members of the Cotswold Association, a neighborhood group, large parcels of the area that became Phillipsburg Manor were purchased from the Indians for such sundry goods as '' 10 blankets, 8 guns, 7 shirts'' as well as ''a tanker of rum, 2 iron pots'' and so on. By 1684, Frederick Phillipse, a carpenter from Holland, had amassed some 192,000 acres, according to the booklet. But in October 1779, during the Revolutionary War, Phillipse's manor was seized from his grandson, who was an English sympathizer. Nine years later, a parcel was carved from the manor that became known as Greenburgh, while other areas became Yonkers and Mount Pleasant, according to Elizabeth Sherman Graif, president of the Cotswold Association. Over the years, some residents have questioned Edgemont's status as an unincorporated section of Greenburgh and have discussed creating a village. The town already has six villages: Ardsley, Tarrytown, Irvington, Dobbs Ferry, Hastings-on-Hudson and Elmsford. ''We want to make Edgemont the seventh,'' said Robert Bernstein, a lawyer in Manhattan and president of the Greenridge Civic Association, which represents about 75 households. ''It's sort of like being in a no-man's land to be in an unincorporated section of the town.'' As a village, Edgemont would be able to elect its own government. A group of about 14 residents has formed the Exploratory Committee for a Better Edgemont to study the issue. Mr. Bernstein and his wife, Nancy, a freelance writer, moved to Edgemont in 1991 from Manhattan. They have two sons, who attend Seely Place School. ''Before we moved here,'' Mr. Bernstein said, ''I never imagined myself so involved in a place and caring about what happens to it. This is what living in a special suburban community like Edgemont can do to you.''  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
