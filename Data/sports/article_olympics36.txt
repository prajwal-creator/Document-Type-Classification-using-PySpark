In the frenzy to find the perpetrator, an innocent man became a suspect.  By Retro Report on Publish Date October 7, 2013.  .  Watch in Times Video »         embed            This week’s Retro Report video tells the story of Richard Jewell, an innocent man, who in the summer of 1996 was painted by some news media outlets as being a likely suspect in a bombing at the Atlanta Olympics, which killed one person and injured more than 100 others. Using archival footage and recent interviews with the lead players, the video explains how a good deal of the newspaper and television coverage relied on unidentified law enforcement sources to cast Mr. Jewell in the worst possible light. It was nearly three months before the federal government cleared him, and almost a decade before Eric Rudolph, a violent anti-abortionist, pleaded guilty to the bombing. Below, The Times’s main reporter on the story recalls lessons learned. ATLANTA — I have perhaps never been so furious with an editor. Those who know me well recognize that this is quite an assertion. It was late in the afternoon of July 30, 1996, and as a national correspondent in the Atlanta bureau of The New York Times I had spent the last several hours frantically trying to confirm the spectacular disclosure in an “extra” edition of The Atlanta Journal, that Richard A. Jewell, a security guard portrayed as a heroic first responder to the Centennial Olympic Park bombing , was in fact the focus of the F.B.I.'s search for the bomber. As I was sweating my deadline, compiling everything I had learned about Mr. Jewell, word was conveyed that the paper’s executive editor at the time, Joseph Lelyveld, had decreed that we would not join the news media herd in reporting that Mr. Jewell was the leading suspect. Nor would we in any way suggest that Mr. Jewell’s actions or personality merited suspicion, as The Journal had in publishing, without attribution, that he “fits the profile of the lone bomber.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Instead, I was to write a modest article – 642 words, as it ended up, less than half the length I figured it merited – about the media riot that followed The Journal’s revelation. In stark contrast to front-page coverage with screaming headlines around the world, my article would be buried deep inside the next day’s newspaper. This decision from New York, that we essentially were not going to compete on the biggest story on earth, rubbed against my every journalistic instinct. I felt like a pit bull tethered to a very short chain.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Under protest, I constructed an awkward lead paragraph that remains both the worst and the best I have ever written: “Coverage of the investigation of the bombing at the Olympics here was dominated for hours today by a report in The Atlanta Journal naming a local security guard as the leading suspect.” The article went on to report that the networks had led their broadcasts with the news and that scores of reporters had assembled outside Mr. Jewell’s apartment. After several paragraphs of this pap, I wrote that federal law enforcement sources had confirmed to The Times that Mr. Jewell was among the suspects in the bombing, but cautioned that there were others, and that there was not sufficient evidence to charge him. When I picked up the newspaper off my driveway the next morning, I could not have been more dispirited about how we had handled the story. In retrospect, of course, the rabbinical wisdom shown by Mr. Lelyveld that afternoon, in the face of intense competitive pressure, provided one of the greatest journalistic lessons of my career. While The Times has demonstrated over the years that it is not immune to misjudgment (as the public editor has discussed ), we stood out in the coverage of the Jewell story for our restraint. Mr. Lelyveld’s call saved the paper, and me, from embarrassment and perhaps from the litigation that Mr. Jewell later pursued against several news organizations. There but for the grace of Joe went I. That nearly two decades later my profession seems to have learned so little from that cautionary tale, and that the transformation of our business by the Internet and social media has, if anything, heightened our proclivity to rush to judgment, is, of course, deeply concerning. The New York Post’s “Bag Men” cover , reporting that the F.B.I. was seeking two innocent Boston Marathon spectators in the April bombing there, is but the latest of many examples. As a native Southerner, and an Atlantan for much of my adulthood, I took the Olympics bombing personally. I remember getting to the park that night shortly after the explosion, in time to interview witnesses who showed off souvenirs from their evening: the nails that the real bomber – Eric Robert Rudolph – had packed into his device as shrapnel. Later that night, I ran into tearful Olympic planners who understood that their years of work had been forever despoiled. What was to be a global coming-out party for a new South changed instantaneously into something dark and disturbing. The press pass I had exploited to slip into Olympic competitions – boxing one day, table tennis the next – would now be used to attend police news conferences. In the ensuing weeks, I continued to report and write about Mr. Jewell . I dug into his court records, interviewed his friends, employers and lawyers, and occasionally joined the media encampment outside his apartment. It did not take long to suspect that the evidence of any wrongdoing was sparse, and that elements of timing made it all but impossible that he was the bomber. Most of my articles remained concise and poorly played, often focusing more on the circus surrounding Mr. Jewell than on his guilt or innocence. The first to appear on Page 1 was the article three months after the bombing in which Kent B. Alexander, then the United States attorney in Atlanta and a longtime friend of mine, declared that Mr. Jewell was no longer a suspect . A day later, I wrote a nearly 3,000-word article, also published on the front page, revealing law enforcement’s various ham-handed efforts to lure Mr. Jewell into self-incrimination. I interviewed Mr. Jewell about his treatment by the news media, which he said had jumped on him “like piranha on a bleeding cow.” He said then, as he did in subsequent interviews, that he knew he could never get his name back.

He had died at age 44 of complications from diabetes, but it was hard, of course, not to assume that a broken spirit had contributed to his demise. Coincidentally, the obituary ran 642 words, the precise length of my initial article about the events that made him a national symbol.   *** This week’s Retro Report is the 14th in a documentary series.
