By A. O. SCOTT DEC. 10, 2015          At 10:35 on the morning of Dec. 17, 1903, on the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk, N.C. ... Do I need to finish the sentence? But just in case: Orville and Wilbur Wright, tinkerers and bicycle mechanics from Dayton, Ohio, got their flying machine aloft for about 12 seconds, ushering in the age of modern aviation. Their feat marked another milestone as well, a signal event in the entwined histories of flight and photography. We know about the launch of the Wright brothers’ Flyer partly because its departure from terra firma was recorded on film, in what David McCullough, in his new biography of the Wrights, rightly calls ‘‘one of the most historic photographs of the century.’’ It’s a still image, but the picture, snapped by Orville and Wilbur’s assistant, John T. Daniels, on a tripod-mounted Grundlach Korona V camera, can nonetheless claim a place of honor in the annals of cinema. The Korona had a fast-enough shutter and a sensitive-enough plate to capture rapid movement in a frame. Daniels, a first-time photographer, was following, whether he knew it or not, in the footsteps of Gaspard-Félix Tournachon, known to his public and to posterity as Nadar, the French artist and entrepreneur who had the brilliant idea, a half-century before the miracle at Kitty Hawk, of going up in a hot-air balloon with a camera. Our vision of the world — quite literally, our sense that the surface of this planet can be flown over and surveyed from above — owes as much to Nadar as our ability to circumnavigate it owes to Orville and Wilbur Wright. Nadar died in 1910, having anticipated and then lived to witness the birth of motion pictures, which custom has fixed in 1895. The Wright Flyer arrived on the scene early in the new century, in time to give the nascent art of movies (invented in America by Thomas Edison) one of its great subjects. And for more than a century since, the visions of cinema and the experience of flight have worked together in ways both obvious and mysterious. Movie cameras and airplanes are the twin manifestations of ancient human desires that dwelled, for most of our existence as a species, in myth and fantasy. Our ancestors made likenesses of everything under the sun in various media, to bridge the strange chasm between thing and idea. They conjured legends of bird-gods and parables in which the urge to take wing was a symbol of aspiration and of hubris.

What if we could fly? The two dreams link up almost effortlessly, and the technologies of their realization complement each other. The first movie to win a Best Picture Oscar was ‘‘Wings.’’ The most recent was ‘‘Birdman.’’ The camera has learned not only to record flight but also to replicate its rhythms and feelings — to swoop and soar, to blast off and fall to earth, to hover over rooftops and leap tall buildings in a single bound.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story        When a dream comes true, though, it touches down amid the dross of ordinary life. Moving pictures and flying machines became less marvelous as they became ubiquitous. We take them for granted, and have even come to resent them. A YouTube search will turn up ancient footage of Wilbur and Orville airborne , images filmed not at Kitty Hawk in 1903 but five years later, in Le Mans, France, and Fort Myers, Va. The brothers, who sometimes banned photography from their public aerial exhibitions — because they feared the resulting pictures could be used to steal their designs — conducted those widely publicized flights partly to ensure that they would always be credited as the inventors of aviation. Wilbur in France and Orville in Virginia stayed airborne for longer and longer periods, and in the clips that survive you can feel both the wonder that attended their accomplishments and also an intimation of impending normalization. Like a lot of old film that has migrated to digital platforms, these images, which have been recycled and repurposed so many times in newsreels and documentaries that their original form is difficult to discern, have a spectral quality. The figures on the screen of your phone or tablet are like ghosts in the machine, and the images are themselves ghosts of the machine — shadows of bygone apparatuses of flight and vision. You notice that takeoff is achieved by means of simple mechanics rather than jet fuel. The plane, its propellers wound tight, sits on a track, its tail tethered to a large weight that is hoisted up a tower and then dropped, the force of its descent catapulting the aircraft down the runway and into the air.

Download our virtual reality app for iPhone and Android.                          The camerawork is similarly primitive and ingenious. No fast cuts, no dollies or cranes to mimic and counterpoint the movement of the objects within the frame. The little window in your laptop screen opens on a charmingly and almost absurdly simpler time, a collection of antique moments that is also a foreshadowing of the present. We live in the grip of a technological paradox, in which the proliferation of wonders dilutes the possibility of wonder. This has partly to do with marketing and mass consumption, with the democratization of the special and the rare. More of us can now see more of the world than ever, whether literally, through travel, or virtually, through images. Some of the mystery, the frisson of discovery, is lost because of that. And yet the domain of astonishment has been extended, its earlier manifestations lovingly preserved. Movies can introduce us to feelings that have no literal correlative, and they can induce those feelings again and again. Orville and Wilbur Wright may have built what was in effect a flying bicycle, but the only way we know what it’s like to ride one is through the mediation of film. When E.T. and Elliott achieve liftoff and pedal into the sky, the effect is transporting and strangely moving. You know how it goes: Your stomach drops and your heartbeat accelerates. Children cheer. Adults burst into tears. It’s scary and inexplicable. Dorothy Gale’s house, lifted out of the Kansas prairie by a twister, encounters Almira Gulch on the prototype of Elliot’s bike. Then, through a clever, easy editing trick, she’s the witch on her broomstick. ‘‘The Wizard of Oz’’ is full of images of flight that are both terrifying and sublime. The wicked witch’s monkeys are like fighter squadrons darkening the sky. Glinda’s bubble and Oz’s balloons are emblems of serenity and optimism. The whole movie is a trip from the ordinary to the magical and back.

The tools that produce this illusion have changed. Watching ‘‘The Wizard of Oz’’ now, you can tell that Dorothy’s house spinning through the cyclone is a miniature, and that the twister Ms. Gulch pedals through is made of back-projected clouds and wisps of smoke-machine fog. You might glimpse, or at least infer, the wires and harnesses aiding E.T. and Mary Poppins. You may even, through DVD commentary or your own geekish tendencies, know a thing or two about process shots and green-screen compositions and three-dimensional computer modeling. You can break down the trick and see how it’s done. The arrival of computer-assisted special effects and the revival of 3-D have made flight simulation on-screen newly attractive, both commercially and aesthetically. At a time of small-screen ascendancy, there has to be something to quicken the pulses of moviegoers — and that something, more often than not, is the defiance of gravity. Just look at the spacewalks in ‘‘Gravity,’’ ‘‘Interstellar’’ and ‘‘The Martian.’’ Did you see ‘‘Furious 7’’? Not technically a flight picture, but an automotive movie that extends the highway into the clouds. Do you remember when the cars parachuted out of the belly of the transport plane and hit the mountain running at full speed? Or when the red sports coupe — was Vin Diesel driving? Michelle Rodriguez? — went zooming around inside the big glass tower in Abu Dhabi and then smashed through the window and sailed over to the other tower and kept going? Oh, man! Pure adrenaline. And pure slapstick sublimity. How did they do that? How did they even think of it? The fun, however, has always cast a shadow. The ‘‘Furious 7’’ skyscraper sequence, thrilling though it is, can’t help evoking the Sept. 11 attacks. An instant cliché after the planes hit the twin towers was ‘‘It was like something out of a movie.’’ In the years since, movies have fought to reclaim the imagination of disaster as their special purview and to restore the innocent anarchy of impact, velocity and flight. We want the thrill without the danger. But the danger is there, alongside the liberation. These machines — airplanes and movie cameras — bring terror along with wonder. Barely a decade after Kitty Hawk, aviation shed its innocence and became an instrument of war. ‘‘We dared to hope we had invented something that would bring lasting peace to the earth,’’ Orville Wright would reflect near the end of his life. ‘‘But we were wrong.’’ While air power was not as decisive or destructive in World War I as it would become in subsequent conflicts, the Great War engendered new images of combat, images that would feed the blossoming and ravenous art of cinema. Fighter pilots flying in formation were like celestial cavalrymen, and their engagements could be imagined as an updated version of hand-to-hand fighting — a test of courage, dexterity and cunning.

The connections between violence, aviation and cinema had already been theorized by the Italian Futurists, whose pre-1914 manifestoes hailed war as ‘‘the world’s only hygiene’’ and hymned the ‘‘sleek flight of planes’’ as avatars of an emerging, mechanized order. Later, under the sway of Mussolini’s Fascism, the movement would develop aeropittura , an approach to painting that took those sleek planes as both subject matter and technical inspiration. The Futurists’ preoccupation with speed, violence and movement also made them early propagandists of cinema as the quintessential modern art — an attitude Il Duce, Italy’s top movie mogul as well as its head of state, very much shared — though their own cinematic efforts were less dynamic than their paintings, poems or polemics. It was Hollywood that would develop a practical aesthetic link between film and aviation, most famously in ‘‘Wings,’’ the inaugural Oscar winner (in 1929) and a blockbuster of the pre-talkie era. An elaborate and expensive production, filmed on location around a San Antonio military base and directed by William Wellman, a decorated former fighter pilot, ‘‘Wings’’ was perhaps more admired for its technical innovation than for its rather conventional story. In that regard, it was an early example of what has become a sturdy Hollywood genre: the effects-driven blockbuster. Viewed from a distance of decades, Wellman’s film holds up well, even when chopped up for piecemeal online viewing. The trailer you find on YouTube opens with a bravura camera movement, a sweeping shot down the middle of a row of cafe tables that seems to have been filmed with the help of a tiny, low-flying crop duster. The film’s dogfights, crashes, emergency landings and near-misses are deftly crosscut between cockpit close-ups and midair medium-range shots, establishing a visual vocabulary that would prove remarkably durable even as the technology continued to advance.

The genre fed off the public’s interest in the real-life exploits of Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart and other celebrity pilots. When the United States entered World War II, the military commissioned Ford and other prominent directors — notably Frank Capra, William Wyler, George Stevens and John Huston — to bring carefully packaged images of the fighting into American movie theaters. In ‘‘Five Came Back,’’ his detailed chronicle of these five wartime auteurs, the journalist Mark Harris notes that before long, ‘‘generic sops to patriotism and adroit use of newsreel footage were no longer enough to stir a jaded public or to make a war documentary worth showing in theaters. Moviegoers didn’t want the story behind the war — they wanted the war, brought home in pictures they couldn’t see anywhere else.’’ To this end, Wyler and his crew embedded (as we might now say) with the 91st Bomb Group. They took their 16-millimeter cameras on bombing runs, in Harris’s words ‘‘lying flat along the belly of the B-17 so they could shoot footage through the ball turret, the position on the plane’s underside that allowed a gunner to fire in all directions.’’ Wyler, who won his first Oscar for ‘‘Mrs. Miniver’’ while overseas, would later be awarded an Air Medal for participating in five sorties and suffer severe damage to his hearing on a subsequent assignment in Italy. The results of his time with the 91st Bomb Group were assembled into a short documen­tary called ‘‘Memphis Belle’’ (1944), which James Agee praised for its immediacy.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘‘I could not guess which shots were re-enacted and which were straight records,’’ Agee confessed, and postwar movies would often aspire to induce precisely this confusion. Agee had an ethical commitment to documentary, and a temperamental suspicion of artifice, and during the war his insistence on the literal, visceral truth reflected the biases of the filmmakers themselves, who often battled Army censors over how much unvarnished reality they could show. But the line between truth and trickery is not always so clear. When the fighting stopped, filmmakers used some of the documentary techniques tested in combat to blur it in new ways, in the service of sensation rather than home-front morale. Nowadays, we’ve turned Agee’s moral puzzlement into a formalist game. The famous ‘‘Ride of the Valkyries’’ sequence in Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘‘Apocalypse Now’’ — the helicopter assault, led by Robert Duvall’s sociopathic Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore, on a Vietnamese hamlet — partakes of some of the immediacy of documentary. Those are actual helicopters in literal space, and the flames are real, too. And so was Coppola’s war, even if the film is a pure fantasia rather than a factual record. The X-wing fighter attack on the Death Star in the movie we now call ‘‘Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope’’ has its own sense of reality, even if it’s all taking place in a long-ago-and-far-away zone of make-believe. Which might mean that we have arrived in a version of the Futurists’ Utopia, a world defined by violence and speed, ubiquitous flying machines and nonstop moving pictures. We can take to the air on the backs of mythical birds or with the assistance of bulky metal suits (like Iron Man) or extraterrestrial super powers (like Superman). We can fling imaginary bodies into virtual space with a few swipes and keystrokes. Our machines are so refined they don’t even seem like machines anymore.

We can’t tell if we’re rocketing through the ether or sitting perfectly still. How did we get from Kitty Hawk to here? It’s possible — it’s surreal — to call up images of Orville and Wilbur taking to the skies in their kitelike Flyer while sitting safely buckled into one of its modern descendants. Watching those archaic, heroic pictures on your iPad as you sip your tomato juice at 30,000 feet is a good way to measure progress and decline. Experiences that a little more than a century ago were unprecedented in their novelty have become routine. Air travel is nothing special. Quite the opposite: It is the realm in which the petty indignities and dubious conveniences of modern life are most heavily concentrated. For the price of an economy ticket, we can endure the rote dumbness of state authority (‘‘Place your shoes directly on the belt’’) and the false friendliness of corporate power. So many choices to fill the dead time — Panda Express; Starbucks; Brookstone — none of them quite what we want. Including the choices for in-flight viewing on the headrest in front of us. All too often, our practices of moviegoing and -watching are similarly alienated. We shuffle into identical, charmless multiplexes in suburban malls or chain-store-clogged downtowns, grumble at the rudeness of our neighbors who text or talk or kick the back of our seat, eat snacks we don’t really like and fidget through the trailers as we wait for the feature. At home we have the illusion of more control, more choice and better snacks, but we end up frittering away hours browsing the various menus and queues before settling down to the same old thing. There’s an old song that says we’ll know we’ve seen it all when elephants fly. Which we have, in ‘‘Dumbo,’’ the movie that wrote the last word on cinematic flight way back in 1941, the time of Pearl Harbor and the Blitz, maybe the darkest year in the short history of actual human flight. ‘‘When I See an Elephant Fly’’ is the theme song, a jaunty revolt against the idea that anything is impossible, and ‘‘Dumbo’’ is one of Disney’s early feature-length parables of gumption and tenacity.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It’s hard to imagine a more earthbound creature than an elephant with big, floppy ears. But as Disney and other cartoon artists discovered, the charm of animation lies in its complete defiance of the laws of physics. You do not need to rig a crane, attach a camera to a glider or hunker down in the ball turret of a flying fortress. With a steady hand and a trained eye — with a labor force of draftsmen and colorists and cel cutters — you can reverse gravity and make your audience feel the giddiness and grace of unassisted flight. ‘‘Dumbo’’ is a cartoon, but it is also an aviation picture, a fantasy that models the movement of organic creatures on the flight of machines, rather than the reverse. Dumbo is a flyboy, but he’s also a plane, requiring the help of Timothy Q. Mouse for navigation and ‘‘Contact!’’ His first sortie is accompanied by crows flying in V-formation, more like a fighter squadron than an avian flock. (They also embody Disney’s unfortunate fondness for racist stereotypes.) The elephant takes off in a cloud of dust, and the first thing he sees when it clears is his shadow moving across the land below, an uncanny sight familiar to every jet traveler lucky enough to score a window seat on a clear day. Dumbo’s climactic, triumphant flight, under the big top at the circus, is a barnstorming tour de force of the kind that brought crowds to the fairgrounds in the ’20s and ’30s, and the theme music is accompanied not by animal noises but by airplanelike buzzing and zooming. A potentially terrifying spectacle turns into a circus act.   It’s this whimsy, this absurdity, this absolute indifference to the dictates of biology, gravity and cinematic coherence — even a child will notice that the proportions are seriously out of whack — that make ‘‘Dumbo’’ the greatest of all in-flight movies. It establishes an essential truth that can be perpetually redefined and rediscovered. The whole idea of flight is crazy. We are earthbound creatures, gray and lumbering and cursed with long memories. We harbor dreams of liberation, of transcendence, but who are we kidding? We can’t fly. And yet we do.   Correction: December 27, 2015  An article on Dec. 13 about the history of flying in cinema misstated the rank of the character Robert Duvall plays in “Apocalypse Now.” The Character is Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore, not Lt. Bill Kilgore.     A. O. Scott is a chief film critic for The Times.
