By noon, he thought his temperature was up and his chest seemed congested. By Monday morning, Mr. Ucho thought he was going to die. ''I was so out of it,'' he said. Mr. Ucho, the principal of St. Francis Xavier Grammar School in Chicago, called in sick and discovered that he was not alone. Ten percent of the 285 pupils were out ill, with a growing number of children with frowns and hot foreheads waiting in the office for parents to pick them up throughout the morning. On Tuesday another 30 children stayed home along with half the teachers. ''It was pointless going on,'' said Mr. Ucho, ''so we shut down till next Monday.'' In Atlanta the Centers for Disease Control confirmed what Mr. Ucho and several million other Americans already know: The 1986 influenza season is under way. The center reported a sudden surge of flu cases in the last week. ''It's up quite a bit,'' said Karl Kappus of the influenza section, ''You'd have to go back to the spring of 1984 for a similar pattern, so many states reporting so many cases.'' 'Widespread Outbreaks'   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Kappus said there were ''widespread outbreaks just about everywhere.'' New England and the extreme southwest from New Mexico to Los Angeles seem to have escaped the heaviest brunt so far, he said, while Washington State, Georgia, New Jersey, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Illinois were particularly hard hit.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       No one was officially calling it an epidemic yet. But as Mary Ann McCarthy, a Philadelphia nurse, put it, ''People think it's an epidemic if four others in their office have it.'' Pennsylvania's hot flu spots were Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. In Durham County, North Carolina, one high school reported 200 of 800 students absent. Officially, that state's influenza outbreaks are monitored through 11 campus infirmaries. A normal weekly caseload is 15. Last week cases totaled 556. ''If it goes over that,'' said Dr. J. Newton MacCormack, chief epidemiologist, ''it'll be our worst year.'' Today this week's figure came through: 966. At the Public Health Service in Seattle, Sue Sackman, a receptionist, began to laugh when asked about the flu outbreaks. Then she started coughing. ''I have the flu so bad myself I can hardly talk,'' she said. The problem is just starting in Washington, according to Dr. John Kobayashi, state epidemiologist. ''It's definitely not one of those quiet years,'' he said. Every population area there has reported an outbreak, with schools showing high absenteeism. Alaska was hard hit too with one high school near Anchorage reporting half its students out and Anchorage Hospital operating with 12 percent of its staff missing.

The last week of December, 2 of New York's 57 counties reported outbreaks. Now the figure is 18 and climbing. New Jersey has reported significant scattered outbreaks too. The Texas authorities reported ''widespread influenza virus activities.'' At Austin's Anderson High School, the nurse, Bonnie Gonzales, said she was sending more students home sick every day. However, because of stringent attendance regulations, she said, many students fear missing too many days and return before completely recovering. Chicago's huge public school system, the nation's third-largest, with 430,000 students and 23,000 teachers, had large numbers of absent students this week. At least two parochial schools closed here, St. Leonard's and Mr. Ucho's. In west suburban DuPage County more than 90 of 210 schools reported absentee rates of 10 to 30 percent. The normal rate is around 5 percent.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The county health director called DuPage an influenza ''nest area.'' ''Why it started here, who knows,'' said Dr. James Paulissen, ''Maybe somebody from New York brought it.'' Actually, his guess on the highly contagious disease's spread may not be too far off. Ralph March, the Illinois immunization director, noted that Chicago and its main airport, O'Hare International, were the nation's major transport hubs. ''Normally, we don't see influenza really get going until 10 days or so after everybody comes home from their holiday travels with everybody locked up indoors,'' Mr. March said, ''This year it was right on time.'' ''So far,'' he added, ''it's less than '84. But we have large, growing regional outbreaks. And they're moving north through the state.'' Attendance Down at Schools In Barrington, Ill., Bob Carpenter said attendance at the 2,300-student high school fell from a normal 96 percent level to 91 percent on Thursday. ''This week has been the worst,'' he said. At Barrington's middle school, normal absenteeism is 45 of the 894 seventh and eighth graders. On Monday, however, 119 were out, 125 on Tuesday, 142 Wednesday, 126 Thursday and 155 today. Worse yet, three of the four secretaries stayed home one day. This year's most active flu viruses are two Type A's Philippines and one Type B U.S.S.R. The latter is most widespread, although victims generally do not bother differentiating. Mr. Kappus said the best treatment during the illness's five- to seven-day course was bed rest, lots of liquids and a nonaspirin pain reliever. However, Mr. March, the Illinois immunization director, has a different idea. He notes that a new virus strain, Type A Chile, had been isolated only in Hawaii. So he has volunteered to spend a week or two in those sunny islands combating this illness on the scene. So far, he said, no one has accepted his generous offer.
