Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art . Museums ★ ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: ‘ART AND CHINA’S REVOLUTION,’ through Jan. 11.  The splashy party that was the 2008 Olympics is yesterday’s news, but one-party rule in China remains. New China is still, in significant ways, Old China. The obvious question is: What comes next? To help answer it, Asia Society asks a different, equally timely post-Olympics question: What came before? This exhibition of paintings, drawings, posters and Maoist souvenirs produced in the years leading up to and during the Cultural Revolution gives complicated answers. It lays out the conflicted loyalties that have shaped contemporary China, and finds them in the work of artists who anticipated the current art boom and are part of it. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org . (Holland Cotter) ★BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: ‘STREET ART STREET LIFE: FROM THE 1950S TO NOW,’ through Jan. 25. If to you “street life” means noise-lights-action, you’ll find this show a surprise. With its immaculate, stripped-down installation, the exhibition is clearly devoted not to recreating the feel of art on the street, but to recording it. History, not buzz, is the subject, and a fascinating history it is, from Robert Frank’s unvarnished photographic views of post-World War II America, to a video of Joseph Beuys sweeping the streets of Berlin clean of trash and ideology in the 1970s, to digital montages by Fatimah Tuggar uniting today’s streets of New York and Lagos, Nigeria. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org . (Cotter) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: ‘GILBERT & GEORGE,’ through Jan. 11. Dynamic duo, gruesome twosome or just plain geeks in ties and tweeds, the British artists Gilbert & George don’t seem to care what you call them as long as you pay attention, which you couldn’t avoid doing if you tried in their suffocating and disordered wraparound survey at the Brooklyn Museum. In no particular sequence, we see the shadowy early black-and-white photographic pieces they did while living in a falling-down section of London in the 1970s, and the huge Pop colored murals filled with flowers and crowds of dishy young men, which decrease in number during the most devastating years of the AIDS epidemic. The newest work in the show, from 2005 and 2006, is crazy, end-of-time stuff. Terrorism and religious fundamentalism are the themes, and Gilbert and George themselves, partners in art as in life, are in the picture, mugging, moralizing, unembarrassed and all but unendurable, in art that’s right for right now. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org . ( Cotter)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ★ BROOKLYN MUSEUM: ‘JESPER JUST: ROMANTIC DELUSIONS,’ through Jan. 4. An enchanting show of four short films exhibits most of the qualities for which Mr. Just has become known since completing his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 2003. Melodramatic but never campy or over the top and made with Hollywood-quality production values, his brief musicals explore vulnerable, ordinarily well-armored zones of the masculine psyche, like grief, same-sex love, Oedipal conflict and spiritual desire. The singing is wonderful. (See above.)

Catherine Opie is many artists in one. Best known in the 1990s for her striking portraits of gay, lesbian and transgendered men and women drawn from a circle of friends and intimates, she is also a photographer of landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, still lifes and lifestyles. She is an insider and an outsider: a documentarian and a provocateur, a classicist and a maverick; a trekker and a stay-at-home; a lesbian feminist mother who resists the gay mainstream; an American — birthplace: Sandusky, Ohio — who has serious arguments with her country and culture. It’s all here in a fine retrospective. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org . (Cotter) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: ‘SUSAN MEISELAS: IN HISTORY,’ through Jan. 4. A certain moral quandary runs throughout this fascinatingly problematic exhibition: how do you reconcile the demands of professionalism and those of human compassion? To her credit, Ms. Meiselas — whose coverage of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in 1978-79 made her one of the world’s most celebrated and criticized war correspondents — does not duck the question. Tension between opportunism and conscience emerges as the show’s main interest — to the point that it trumps its ostensible subjects, which include violence in Central America, strippers in traveling carnivals and forensic investigations of Saddam Hussein’s campaign against the Kurds in northern Iraq. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org .  (Johnson) ★ THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ‘GIORGIO MORANDI, 1890-1964,’ through Dec. 14. Aspirants to the role of painter as poet are many. Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964) was the real thing. And this Morandi retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is something that anyone who loves painting and its very specific poetry will want to see. Morandi’s still lifes are beautiful, but with a distinctive kind of beauty. And despite their small size and plain components — bottles, jars, boxes, pots, seashells, vases — they are emotionally audacious. This isn’t because of what they say outright, but because of what they don’t say; because they are so evidently shaped by self-restraint, and the passions that produced it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org . (Cotter) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: JOHN MILTON’S ‘PARADISE LOST,’ through Jan. 4. To mark Milton’s quadricentennial, eight of the pages of the only known surviving manuscript of Book 1 of "Paradise Lost" are on view, along with other Miltoniana — a first edition, a miniature portrait believed to be of the poet. The handwriting is a scribe’s; Milton, who was blind, composed the work orally. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org . MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: ‘SECOND LIVES: REMIXING THE ORDINARY,’ through Feb. 15. The inaugural show in the Museum of Arts and Design’s jewel-box-like building continues its haphazard segue from a concentration on craft to a hipper, more wide-ranging program. Unfortunately, the focus is a strategy that is epidemic in the larger art world: the massing of something small (plastic spoons, ladies pumps, spools of thread, dangling eyeglasses) into something large (a pyramid, a loveseat, a view of the “Mona Lisa,” a chandelier). It is Surrealism 101, descended from Meret Oppenheim’s beloved and far too influential fur-lined teacup. Basically, you see the thing. You see the things it is made of. Something in the way of a punch line follows. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org . (Roberta Smith) MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: ‘PARIS/NEW YORK: DESIGN FASHION CULTURE, 1925-1940,’ through Feb. 22. This compact yet kaleidoscopic exhibition celebrates the romance that flourished between New York and Paris in the 1920s and ’30s, when French Art Deco was the style, American jazz was the music, and skyscrapers and sumptuous ocean liners were among the symbols of the age. Selected and installed to extract maximum wattage from every juxtaposition, object and image (including many surprisingly effective digital reproductions), it tracks the exchange of goods as much as of ideas, and the roles played by both department stores and museums, knock-offs and originals, businessmen (especially developers) and designers and artists. Most memorably, it clarifies a golden age of design and building, when New York became the world capital of Art Deco architecture. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org . (Smith) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ‘VAN GOGH AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT,’ through Jan. 5. This small, anomalous exhibition is a Van Gogh antiblockbuster with a seemingly counterintuitive theme, given the importance of the brilliant light of southern France to his art. It explores Van Gogh’s special relationship with darkness, where his interests in perception, color and symbolism fuse with unexpected intensity. And seeing a manageable number of Van Goghs — including masterpieces like “The Potato Eaters,” “The Starry Night” and “Night Café” — in intimate galleries is thrilling. (212) 708-9400, moma.org . ( Smith)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   SCHOMBURG CENTER FOR RESEARCH IN BLACK CULTURE: ‘AARON DOUGLAS: AFRICAN-AMERICAN MODERNIST,’ through Nov. 30. In 1920s New York a great flowering of black culture emerged that came to be known as the Harlem Renaissance. No visual artist expressed that movement’s euphoric sense of possibility with greater verve than the subject of this valuable exhibition, the painter, illustrator and muralist Aaron Douglas. His major works feature semitransparent silhouettes of black people in heroic poses overlaid by concentric, circular bands of light. Rendered in muted, luminous colors, they project visionary romanticism in a suave, Art Deco-like style. 515 Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2200, nypl.org/research/sc . (Johnson) THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: ‘KEHINDE WILEY, THE WORLD STAGE: AFRICA, LAGOS-DAKAR,’ through Oct. 26. In 10 recent works Kehinde Wiley shifts the focus of his big, flashy pictures of young African-American men recast as the kings, dandies, and saints of European painting to young African men in the poses of African sculpture. The show (which really belongs in a commercial gallery) reveals a young artist who, despite several years of hotness, is only now beginning to make paintings that don’t feel mostly like campy, gaudy illustrations. The compositions are calmer, the details less fussy, and the figures are painted with a new solidity and emotional directness. It makes a big difference. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org . (Smith) Galleries: SoHo ★ RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA: ‘DEMONSTRATION DRAWINGS’ This ambitious conceptual show by Rirkrit Tiravanija is made up of some 200 small, highly detailed graphite drawings of political demonstrations from around the world. Most of the images were derived from newspaper photographs and have the on-the-spot look of reportage. All were done by artists in Thailand working on generous commissions from Mr. Tiravanija, with proceeds from the sale of the pictures going to the Land Foundation, a sustainable housing community in Thailand. The results in the show: drawing, the sine qua non of “real” art, meets the real world, and paradoxes unroll. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org , through Nov. 6. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea DAVID HARRISON: ‘GREEN AND PLEASANT LAND’ The force of the New York debut of this London artist is somewhat muffled by the current profusion of retro, awkward and/or small-scale figurative painting and drawing (to which this gallery has certainly contributed). The best works merge goth suggestion, visionary light and Edwardian comportment, usually in landscapes with mysterious houses. Colors are rich; styles, subjects and paint handling vary; robust chunks of collage sometimes enter the pictures, as does an owl or two. Enough is happening to bode well for the future. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, (212) 924-4949, through Oct. 18. (Smith) JOSEF KOUDELKA: ‘INVASION 68, PRAGUE’ During a few days in August 1968, Josef Koudelka had his first experience as a street photographer, taking pictures inside history as it unfolded. He gave a firsthand account of life, death and resistance on the streets of Prague, as the mostly Soviet tanks of the Warsaw Pact crushed the lenient Communist government led by Alexander Dubcek. Although a few negatives were smuggled to the West immediately after the occupation, this throat-catching show is the largest yet devoted to them. Aperture Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 505-5555, through Oct. 30. (Smith)  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Proof positive are 10 large, haunting color photographs in this engrossing New York debut. They record the accumulated drawings, signatures, messages and graffiti in caves in Tennessee and Alabama. The tools range from rocks and charcoal (such as the original cave painters used) to fluorescent spray paint; the mark makers range from slaves to contemporary teen-agers. The result is an inadvertent cultural cross-section that is sometimes beautiful and always eerie. Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410, through Oct. 25. (Smith) Galleries: Other ‘BEGIN AGAIN RIGHT BACK HERE’ With a small, early Sol LeWitt grid sculpture as touchstone, the curatorial debut of the artist B. Wurtz proves that less can be anything. The modest efforts of 14 artists, 3 designers and 1 writer — including Vincent Fecteau, Sterling Ruby, Taylor Davis, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, Fawn Krieger, Anna Castelli and Wayne Koestenbaum — variously mix aspects of sculpture, design object, architectural model, clothing or book. Their delicate mood is nicely confirmed or disrupted by smaller displays of Mark Barrow’s texture-obsessed paintings; the raucous quilts of Violette Alby; and a 25-year survey of work by the talented Dan Asher, whose irresistible musical video “Moonscape” should not be missed. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street (entrance on Horatio Street), West Village, (212) 924-4212, through Oct. 25. (Smith) EUNICE KIM: ‘MOON THE MAGIC LOSER’ In her first gallery show Eunice Kim has created something like a walk-in Cornell box, only more ephemeral and overtly recycled. After lining the gallery’s two exhibition spaces with sheets of newspaper, she populated it sparsely with sculptures and mobiles, all made of found materials and objects. Some are better than others, but the low-tech, light-touch transformation of the white cube is hard to beat. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, through Oct. 19. (Smith) * ‘SCULPTING TIME’ This exceptionally beautiful exhibition features four painters who are famous for repeating themselves over many years: Josef Albers, On Kawara, Giorgio Morandi and Roman Opalka.(A fifth, Andrew Grassi, who creates small, technically impressive Photorealist paintings, seems to have wandered in from another exhibition.) Sparely installed in a warren of eight intimate rooms, the show turns the gallery into a numinous aesthetic funhouse. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, through Nov. 1. (Johnson)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Last Chance CHARLES BURNS One of today’s preeminent comic-book artists, Mr. Burns takes his readers on funny and scary journeys down all kinds of mind-bending rabbit holes. This absorbing exhibition of drawings dating from 1983 to the present focuses on full-page images made as covers for Mr. Burns’s graphic novel “Black Hole.” Many have an eerie, archetypal resonance, like illustrations for a modern Grimm’s Fairy Tales. Adam Baumgold Gallery, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338; closes on Saturday. (Johnson) JERONIMO ELESPE This artist, based in Madrid, makes portraits, landscapes and interior scenes with an eye to the great Spanish painters. Gray, found in the backgrounds of paintings by Goya and Velázquez, is the dominant color and mood. Mannered portraiture remains Mr. Elespe’s great strength, but several landscapes are noteworthy for their highly worked surfaces and nocturnal palette. The heavily impastoed “Lower Garden” (2006-7) and the nearly iridescent “Untitled (Garden)” (2005) have a cumulative beauty, a result of small adjustments made over many months. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, (212) 337-9563, johnconnellypresents.com ; closes on Saturday. (Karen Rosenberg) N. S. HARSHA The first half of a two-part installation by an artist from Mysore, India, is made of two large pieces. One is a sculptural re-creation of a traditional Indian outdoor meal, with food served on palm leaves; the food in this case being hyper-realistic plastic versions of the real thing, like the sample dishes displayed outside Japanese restaurants. The absent guests are represented by footprints on the floor, but also appear in a large painting in which hundreds of figures sit down side by side in long rows to chat. Bodhi Art, 535 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-2644, bodhiart.in; closes on Tuesday. (Cotter) VIK MUNIZ: ‘VERSO’ The old paintings leaning face-first against the gallery walls — including Seurat’s “Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte” and Picasso’s “Desmoiselles D’Avignon” — are, in fact, replicas created by Mr. Muniz with the assistance of craftsmen who faithfully reproduced the back sides of the originals. To meditate on these trompe l’oeil sculptures is to wonder about our habits of seeing and believing. Sikkema Jenkins & Company, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262, sikkemajenkinsco.com ; closes on Saturday. (Johnson) ★ LORRAINE O’GRADY: ‘MISCEGENATED FAMILY ALBUM’ An important and beautiful show by an important and influential artist examines race, class, history, family and love. The work has particular resonance in this election year. Alexander Gray Associates, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 1019, Chelsea, (212) 399-2636, alexandergray.com ; closes on Saturday. (Cotter) ‘SCRAWL’ Some people become writers when they become crazed enough by the state of things, and collectors when they become crazy enough about a certain kind of artifact. The two extremes converge in “Scrawl,” an exhibition organized by Harley Spiller from his collection (one of 80) of homemade stickers, broadsides and other communiqués culled from the streets of New York over the past 23 years. Among the 40 people represented here, handwriting, pen and paper vary; trigger points include the government, corporations, politicians and people unlike themselves. But their objections offer energetic evidence that the death of the author is greatly exaggerated. Apex Art, 291 Church Street, near White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, apexart.org ; closes on Saturday. (Smith) HANS SILVESTER: ‘PAINTED PEOPLE’ These large color photographs document the extraordinary body painting of the semi-nomadic, cattle-herding Surma and Mursi peoples of the Omo Valley in southern Ethiopia. A daily habit that is both expressive and functional, these vibrantly patterned ephemeral motifs reflect a sophisticated vocabulary of mark-making, finger-painting and hand-printing techniques while also sometimes serving as insect repellent. They are humbling, to say the least, and reveal both abstraction and painting as basic human traits, not Western or modernist peccadilloes. Marlborough, 545 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-8634, marlboroughgallery.com ; closes on Saturday. (Smith) AGATHE SNOW: ‘JUST SAY YES’ Agathe Snow’s talents as a mixed-media bricoleur are shown to incoherent effect in an installation of eight hanging sculptures based on Leonardo da Vinci’s fables. Although each effort has points of interest in the use of materials, the body language or emotional resonance, the effect of extremely messy piñatas prevails over all. In the courtyard behind the gallery, the Swiss artist Roman Signer gets by without blowing anything up. James Fuentes LLC, 35 St. James Place, Chinatown, (212) 577-1201, jamesfuentes.com ; closes on Sunday. (Smith)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘THE NEW YORK CITY WATERFALLS’ Walt Whitman would be pleased. The four waterfalls that the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson has temporarily insinuated along Whitman’s beloved East River (one on Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, a fourth on Governors Island) tweak the ecstatic experience of city life that is especially palpable at water’s edge. Forming a mammoth yet oddly discreet work of shoreline land art, they are spectacular only in the cumulative sense, although the top level of Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport is a great place from which to pick out all four. Their scaffoldings and standard New York apartment riser pipes make them, strictly speaking, fountains. But they are also mirages that add uncanny signs of a primordial Eden that never was. Faking natural history with basic plumbing, they form little rips in the urban fabric through which you glimpse hints of a lost paradise, and sharpen your sense of Whitman’s, the one you are already in. Pier 35 in Lower Manhattan, the eastern foot of the Brooklyn Bridge; between Piers 4 and 5 near the Brooklyn Heights Promenade; north shore of Governors Island; nycwaterfalls.org ; closes on Monday. (Smith) ★ WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: ‘PAUL MCCARTHY: CENTRAL SYMMETRICAL ROTATION MOVEMENT: THREE INSTALLATIONS, TWO FILMS,’ Mr. McCarthy’s fans are in for a shock. They will find almost nothing of what this Los Angeles master of transgressive provocation is famous for in this smart, tightly focused exhibition of works dating from 1966 to the present. No psychotic clowning, no pornographic vaudeville. Instead they will discover Mr. McCarthy’s art stripped to its bare, abstract yet still metaphorically resonant essentials. The main attractions are two scarily mechanized rooms and a walk-in enclosure dizzyingly animated by feedback loops from four rotating video cameras. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org ; closes on Sunday. (Johnson) ★ IVAN WITENSTEIN Ivan Witenstein’s satirical sculptures get more preposterously grotesque every time out, a development entirely appropriate to the politics of the moment. The figurative work here is a head-on collision between Ralph Bakshi and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, with Daumier, Ronald Reagan and Mark Twain jammed in. Like the best apocalyptic art, the work is superb and awful, minutely controlled and ready to explode. Derek Eller, 615 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com ; closes on Saturday.
