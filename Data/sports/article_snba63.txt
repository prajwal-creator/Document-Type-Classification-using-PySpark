For one, all the players appear to be Japanese. For another, there is an uncommon level of teamwork. This is Keio Academy, where most of the students live on the school's sprawling campus in Purchase, where kendo, judo and karate are popular sports and where there is no football team. Keio Academy, established 10 years ago, is an arm of the Keio Gijuku private school system of Japan and is intended primarily for Japanese students living abroad. Its graduates are automatically accepted into Keio University in Japan, although many attend other universities worldwide. It provides a bilingual and bicultural education. And it fields some pretty competitive teams. Two years ago, its rugby team won the national championship.

''The Japanese believe athletics and/or fitness are equally important to becoming a well-rounded person.  But academics takes a higher place, and justifiably so.''  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The field is leveled somewhat by the enthusiasm of the students, said Dr. Teruo Inoue, Keio's headmaster. ''Our founder emphasized the physical and mental health of the student,'' Dr. Inoue said. ''Because of our 358 students, 300 are boarders, they have time for sports and like them very much. We emphasize studies as a policy. The priority is always academic achievement, but our sports activities are very strong because of our students' eagerness.'' This year's cross-country team ran with such eagerness that it made the state championships. ''No individual standout,'' Gossett said, ''just a pack of athletes running well.'' Cathi Wasilik, the athletic director at the School of the Holy Child in Rye, has sent teams against Keio in many girls sports and admires the approach of its teams, known as the Unicorns. ''Their athletes are very disciplined,'' she said. ''They may be a bit more formal than some of the other teams we play.'' It makes for a coach's dream, said Josh Weinman, the new varsity basketball coach, who has moved up from junior varsity. ''Keio students are easy to coach,'' he said. ''They want to be coached.  They want to get better. They listen.''

An all-state soccer player, Okawa is also one of the top point guards in League III-B basketball.

''Kenji has a terrific feel for both games, reacts instinctively, is very competitive and is a superb passer.'' Okawa played baseball and soccer in his native Tokyo but learned basketball when his family moved to Pittsburgh six years ago. ''My friends there all played, and I picked it up,'' he explained. ''I played basketball to hang out with my friends.  Actually, my major sport is soccer.'' And it is a bit different here. ''The environment is very different,'' Okawa said. ''In Japan we played soccer on sand, here it is on grass.'' There are other variances. ''In Japan we take practice more seriously,'' Okawa said. ''Here, there is more freedom.'' And at Keio there is, Okawa contended, as much variety as one might find at a public school. ''There are people here from many countries,'' he said. ''Brazil, France. And many states. They do not act like Japanese from Japan. They act differently.'' And many of them love basketball.  Weinman rated the current Unicorns ''a pretty good team as Keio goes.'' ''Height and experience are always a problem here, but this team's strengths are outside shooting and quickness,'' the coach said. And school support. ''Basketball is very popular at Keio,'' Weinman said. ''Thirty-five kids came out for the team. They love it.''

Girls teams outnumber boys teams 8 to 7, since there is no boys lacrosse team. Basketball, however, will not be a part of Kenji Okawa's future. Upon graduation, he plans to attend Keio University on the way to becoming a lawyer. ''In Japan I will have to choose one sport,'' Okawa said. ''It's not played in seasons, like here. I'm choosing soccer.''  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.                   What's Next    Loading...
