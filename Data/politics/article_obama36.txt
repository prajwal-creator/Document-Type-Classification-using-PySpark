Edsall  JUNE 30, 2016       Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story             Black political power is declining in cities across the country, including Oakland, St. Louis, Cleveland and Atlanta — even as African-Americans are gaining majority status in an increasing number of suburbs. At the same time, African-American emigration to the South has started to weaken Republican control of some deep red states. Let’s start with Washington, D.C. The shift there (as elsewhere) is driven both by gentrification and by a black movement away from urban centers. In 1957, Washington became the first large city in the United States to become majority African-American. In 1973, Congress gave home rule to the District. The first mayoral election was held in 1974, and Walter Washington , who had been appointed to the position in 1967, won it. He was the first of a series of black mayors that has continued to this day.

White voters in Washington already wield significant power in the city’s elections. In 2014, Muriel Bowser , an African-American reform candidate , defeated Vincent Gray, the African-American incumbent — who was accused of campaign finance violations but exonerated after the election — by winning decisive majorities in predominately white wards . Ward 3, in Northwest Washington, where much of the city’s elite lives, is the most affluent of the city’s eight wards. The median household income in the ward is $109,909, 78 percent of the population is white and in 2013 the average single family home cost nearly $1,000,000. Ward 3 backed Bowser 63.49 percent to 11.45 percent. At the same time, Bowser lost the three poorest black wards (5,7 and 8), which have a median household income of $42,177 and where single family houses cost an average of $250,000 in 2013, by large margins. Ward 7, across the Anacostia River in the Southeast corner of the city, backed Gray over Bowser 59.48 percent to 28.0 percent. Over the past 15 years, the District has experienced both an exodus of black residents and an influx of whites. Young, well-educated whites are moving into once minority, often depopulated and dilapidated neighborhoods, where new condo and rental apartment construction is booming . The black share of Washington’s population fell from a high of 71.1 percent in 1970 to 48.3 percent as of July 2015 . The white share has grown from 27.7 percent in 1970 to 44.1 percent, if Hispanics who identify themselves as white are included. If only non-Hispanic whites are counted, the white share has grown to 36.1 percent. Hispanics, who are likely to hold the balance of political power between whites and blacks, have grown from 2.1 percent of the District’s population in 1970 to 10.6 percent in 2015. Asian-Americans have gone from 0.7 percent to 4.2 percent over the same period. In terms of political power, the more important numbers are those for city residents who are at least 18 and eligible to vote. William Frey , a demographer at the Brookings Institution, provided The Times with calculations based on July 2015 census data. It shows that non-Hispanic whites made up 39.2 percent of eligible voters and blacks 44.6 percent; Hispanics are at 9.7 percent and Asian-Americans at 4.5 percent.

In the 2014 mayoral election, turnout in the four wards where whites are either in the majority or the plurality was 28.98 percent. This was more than four points higher than the 24.74 percent turnout in the four wards where African-Americans are in the majority or a plurality, according to an analysis based on data from the DC Board of Elections , the Urban Institute and the DC Office of Planning . The turnout gap between rich and poor wards was even larger, 7.84 points in the 2014 contest. In the most affluent four wards (median household income $95,257), the turnout rate of registered voters was 30.83 percent; in the four poorest wards (median household income $49,520), the turnout rate was 22.99 percent. If Marion Barry — Washington’s volatile four-term mayor — were alive today, he would be appalled at these dismal turnout levels. From the 1994 primary – when Barry was active and on the ballot — to the primary in 2014, the year he died, turnout in Ward 8, Barry’s base, fell from 37.8 percent to 15.54 percent. The 2014 election marked the first time when the number of black voters was eclipsed by the number of all other voters, including whites, Hispanics and Asian-Americans. As Paul Schwartzman and Ted Mellnik of the Washington Post wrote: A surge of young, mainly white voters living in newly affluent neighborhoods emerged as a powerful force in last November’s elections in the District, a seismic shift that mirrors the evolution of the city’s population and could reshape its politics in years to come. The Post found that in the 2014 primary, blacks made up 48 percent of voters compared to 51 percent “other.” In the general election, which included a referendum on legalization of marijuana that brought many young white voters to the polls, blacks were 46 percent to 53 percent “other.” In the event of a future racially polarized Democratic mayoral primary pitting a major black candidate against a major white candidate, Hispanics would be in a position to determine the outcome. There are some indications of how Hispanic voters might cast their ballots. The February 1989 Chicago mayoral primary provides perhaps the most relevant case study. Richard M. Daley, who is white, challenged Eugene Sawyer, the black incumbent. In that contest, Daley won Hispanic voters 83-15.

Credit Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post, via Getty Images    In an email, Piston wrote that the “findings constitute suggestive evidence” that in a white vs. black election, Hispanics could provide “a victory for the white candidate, because Latinos tend to view whites more favorably than blacks.” Piston cautioned, however, that the policies espoused by the white and black candidates could also play a crucial role: Latinos are more egalitarian than whites and more comfortable with big government. If the black candidate was to the left of the white candidate in the scenario you describe with respect to these two core values, and if Latinos voted with these two core values in mind, this would draw Latinos on balance to the black candidate. I contacted a number of politicians, operatives, researchers and political scientists to get their assessment of the likelihood that the District will elect a white mayor and got a mixed response. Anthony Pierce , a partner at the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld who is active in local politics, wrote in response to my email: I see no reason why the city can’t elect a white mayor. While I in no way think we are in a post racial era, I do believe that most of the citizens of the city would have no genuine bias on this issue. In fact, the younger folks who have made up most of the city’s growth spurt are far more welcoming of differences than their elders. Like any successful mayoral candidate, the politician would have to speak to issues relevant to those in the city with a plan to tackle crime, affordable housing and continue the improvement in the business climate to achieve job growth, etc. but I certainly think it could be done. Matthew Green, a political scientist at Catholic University, said the prospect of a white mayor is “absolutely, clearly possible.” He noted that major sections of the city have been transformed, in most cases resulting in more whites: The city has been changing pretty dramatically. There are neighborhoods I don’t even recognize anymore. There are, however, some dissenters. Garry Young, director of the Center for Washington Area Studies at George Washington University, downplayed the possibility that Washington could elect a white mayor, noting that African-American’s remain the largest racial group in the District with close to 50 percent. Non-Hispanic whites still only make up a tad more than one third. Young also pointed out that The dynamic that seems in play now is you have black candidates who attract the business community and white voters in Northwest and then do well enough among black and Latino voters elsewhere to win the Democratic primary. That’s a proven winning strategy. Could a white candidate put together the same sort of coalition? Possibly — and one day probably as I think the District’s continues to become whiter — but I think it’s still a long-shot in the short run. Hal Wolman, a political scientist at George Washington put an entirely different spin on the question: I think there are a substantial number of whites who will support a “reform” black candidate (think Anthony Williams or Adrian Fenty ) but would be unwilling — think liberal guilt — to vote for a white one. Nationally, blacks and whites have significantly different views on some issues, while finding common ground on others. A 2014 Gallup survey found distinct, but not necessarily conflicting, policy priorities. One of the biggest differences is on the question whether blacks and white have the same opportunities for jobs: 74 percent of whites say yes compared to 40 percent of blacks. Another major difference is on the question of whether the American system of justice is biased against African-Americans. Blacks say it is, by 68 to 26, while 69 percent of whites say the system in not biased, and 25 percent say it is. A separate September 2014 Gallup study found major racial differences on the role of government in remedying discrimination. Asked if government should play a major, minor or no role at all in “improving the social and economic conditions of blacks and other minorities,” 22 percent of whites said a major role, compared to 54 percent of African-Americans. In the District, however, where the proportion of liberal whites is much higher than in the nation at large, these racial differences are much smaller and less divisive. Despite the particular demographic profile of the District, the population trends in Washington are emblematic of shifts taking place in a number of major cities.

African-Americans in Chicago, who were a plurality in 2010, were pushed by whites to second place over the next four years. In St. Louis, blacks fell from 51.3 percent of the population in 2010 to 49.5 percent in 2014 The black population of Atlanta has been falling steadily, from 61.6 percent of the city in 2000 to 52.4 percent in 2014. The African-American share of Cleveland’s population rose from 51 percent in 2000 to 53.3 percent in 2010, but then fell to 51.3 in 2014. The black share of the population has also begun to decline in cities ranging from Boston and New York on the East Coast to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland on the West Coast. The geographic movement of African-Americans will produce a shift in black political power from some cities to surrounding suburbs and to states in the South. Georgia, for example, is a state where Democrats are making gains, so much so that the Clinton campaign is considering a possible drive to win what has been a solidly red state. The slow but steady increase in the percentage of Georgia residents who are minorities is crucial to this process. In the five years from 2010 to 2015 , the percentage of non-Hispanic whites in Georgia has fallen from 55.9 to 53.9 percent, while the percentage of African-Americans has grown from 30.5 to 31.7, and Hispanics from 8.8 to 9.4 percent. These shifts may appear small, but over time they can change a state from red to purple. By far the dominant trend, however, is the migration of African-Americans from center cities to the suburbs. A July 2015 study, “ Black flight to the suburbs on the rise ,” by William Frey, the Brookings scholar I mentioned earlier, found that metropolitan areas in the growing parts of the country are registering the greatest numeric gains in suburban black population. The suburbs of Atlanta, Houston, Washington, D.C., and Dallas experienced the largest increases in black population during 2000-2010.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Driving the movement of African-Americans to the suburbs, Frey wrote, are the young, those with higher education, and married couples with children — attributes that characterized white suburbanization for almost a century. Politically, the migration out of cities to the suburbs will lead to some diffusion of black political power, but not necessarily to a diminishment. In the Washington metropolitan area, for example, black migration has been, in large part, to Prince Georges County, which in 1980 was 59.9 percent white and 37.3 percent black — with a white-dominated county government and a white member of Congress. By 2014 , the county was 65.4 percent African-American and 23.2 percent white — with a black county executive, a black dominated county council and a black member of Congress. Over time, African-Americans in the Washington metropolitan area may be forced through demographic change to cede some power in the District, which has a population of 672,228. At the same time, African-American control of Prince George’s County might be an avatar of a deeper transformation. The county not only has a population of 909,535, but it also has a member of Congress who can actually vote, unlike the District’s quasi-congressional representation. By most standards, this is not a bad deal. A focus on the black-white-Hispanic urban splits can serve to obscure what is possibly a more salient development: the ongoing political alignment of well-educated, relatively well-off whites with racial and ethnic minorities. It is this racially and ethnically diverse urban-metropolitan coalition that currently supports Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party and that elected Barack Obama twice. It is viscerally opposed to Donald Trump. “Today, roughly half of all Americans live in the 144 largest counties, while the other half occupies the remaining 2,998 counties,” Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, wrote on his blog in January . Obama won, Sabato noted, “even though he carried only 22 percent of all counties,” including 46 of the 50 most populous counties.

The Guardian noted that in the case of Brexit, it’s clear that densely populated urban areas with a lot of young people such as Hackney and Islington in London voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Union. Or as Newsweek put it Most large urban centers elected to stay part of the European Union, particularly in London, where many local authorities delivered vast majorities for the pro-EU campaign. There is an ongoing struggle, then, for cultural as well as economic resources, within rapidly transforming metropolitan-urban centers — just as there is a struggle for broader forms of power between regions and between countries. As both traditional and cosmopolitan values form the basis of alliances that sometimes compete and sometimes cooperate, the opportunities for a peaceful reshaping of coalitions on both the left and the right are there. But as conflicts related to economic and social modernization erupt at locations as far apart as Ferguson and Falluja, the potential is also clear for ever more dangerous conflict.
