Many Democrats agreed, predicting a big loss in the House and one in the Senate, which would give Republicans a filibuster-proof supermajority, their largest since Warren G. Harding. That month, the two of us browbeat a handful of donors to finance a national survey to see if there was any way Democratic candidates could make Republican overreach on impeachment a winning election issue. When we got the results, we found that Republicans had a three-point lead over the Democrats in the Congressional ballot, but that wasn’t the discouraging part. After respondents heard our messages attacking Republicans for dwelling  on impeachment and failing to address America’s priorities, the Republican lead actually grew to six points. In this environment, voters were not listening to Democratic messengers and their messages. Conversations with the donors who had backed the study were deeply depressing. At the beginning of October, with the House ready to open debate on impeachment, support for Democrats in Gallup’s generic poll fell below the critical 50 percent line. Newt Gingrich, the House majority leader, predicted a Republican majority even bigger than the one produced by the upheaval he had led in 1994. Time magazine considered Mr. Gingrich’s claim “only marginally boastful.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But hope springs eternal. With the White House and Democratic Congressional leaders mired in the impeachment battle, we decided to conduct the same  survey again. This time, though, the results were different. Three in five respondents said they were more likely to vote for candidates who wanted to “bring the impeachment to an end in 30 days” and who said: “The country has had enough. My main goal is to get Congress to focus on the needs of American families.” What’s more, this message enabled Democratic candidates to improve their margin in the survey by six  points.

Meanwhile, Republicans doubled down on their misguided strategy — highlighting the impeachment and the ensuing scandal with a late advertising blitz.

Democrats surprised everyone : no net losses in the Senate and a net gain of five seats in the House — the best showing for the incumbent president’s party in a midterm  election since 1934. Newt Gingrich resigned.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

There are fears that Democrats could lose as many as 50 House seats; the Senate could go either way.  A survey last week by our polling group, Democracy Corps, had Democrats down five points in the House ballot. Add to this early voting, heavy campaign spending by outside corporate groups, high unemployment and the general feeling that the country is on the wrong track, and it is hard to imagine that Nov.  2 will be a good day for Democrats. But there are two patterns in today’s polls that indicate voters might still be listening and just might be open to supporting Democrats. In our latest national poll, we found that the Republican Party and the Republicans in Congress are as unpopular as the Democrats — unusual for a party riding a wave of support.  With Republican candidates like  Sharron Angle, Joe Miller, Christine O’Donnell, Rand Paul and Carl Paladino dominating the spotlight, Republicans find themselves no more appealing to voters now than they were in 2008. In addition, there are signs that voters are still open to hearing from Democrats. An NPR  poll that surveys likely voters in key House districts found this month that a Democratic message focused on the middle class and American jobs won out over a Republican message of deficit reduction and wasteful spending. (Disclosure: Greenberg Quinlan Rosner helped conduct this survey.)   True, voters are not particularly moved by Democratic messages about Republican extremism or the policies that produced the recession. But they are open to hearing about how to repair the economy and put Americans back to work. This is surprising,  because voters normally tune out the party they want to punish at the polls. Will this election be a disaster for Democrats? We don’t know. What we do know, however, is that based on our experiences leading up to the last supposed Democratic debacle, candidates may have more control over their destinies than they  think.   Stanley B.
