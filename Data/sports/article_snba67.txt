NEW YORKERS & CO.; 'Getting Into Dark Corners'   By DAVID KIRBY DEC. 31, 2000     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           FROM atop the Loews State Theater Building, the B. Manischewitz Company, world's largest matzo bakers, happily present 'Yiddish Melodies in Swing!' '' Sixty years ago, those words crackled over the city's airwaves like an ethnic siren, calling Jewish immigrants to the living-room radio set for wholesome entertainment and communing with family roots. Now the old Yiddish voices are rising from obscurity again, thanks to Sound Portraits Productions, a nonprofit New York company whose specialty is radio documentaries. Those words will be heard on the ''Yiddish Radio Project,'' a 12-part series that is to be broadcast next fall on National Public Radio. ''The radio rescued in this collection exists by pure chance, found on old aluminum discs that survived World War II scrap-metal drives,'' said David Isay, Sound Portraits' founder and executive producer. The company is collaborating on the project with Henry Sapoznik, an ethnomusicologist who discovered the discs in various musty storage rooms more than 15 years ago.

This series will offer modern-day audiences a tiny fraction of what was heard.

Radio news features, a staple of the medium in the salad days of Edward R. Murrow, are conceived, reported, written and narrated in a manner distinct from film. A simple microphone can go places and do things that a clunky, intrusive camera crew cannot. Sound Portraits has made 15 documentaries since it was founded in 1994. It is one of only about half a dozen such companies in the country and one of only two nonprofit New York companies in this field. The other, Radio Diaries, run by Joe Richman, is even smaller; the company was founded in 1999, although Mr. Richman made documentaries as a freelancer before that. Overall he has made more than 25 documentaries. Though both companies are based in the city, neither focuses on it exclusively. And both specialize in handing microphones over to their subjects so they can tell their own tales without a narrator. ''Radio is a great medium for telling the type of stories we like to tell,'' Mr. Isay said in an interview at his company's sleek new office in Chinatown. ''It's a storyteller's medium, great for narratives -- just the voice, no picture, no preconceived notions that come with something visual.'' Radio documentaries are also ''great for getting into dark corners,'' Mr. Isay said. ''They help people who can't necessarily communicate through writing to tell their stories. It's about the underdogs, about finding the poetry in the stories of those people who don't get magazine covers. There are segments of society whose stories don't get told, and that silence is very dangerous.'' Sound Portraits' documentaries include ''Ghetto Life 101'' and ''Remorse: The 14 Stories of Eric Morse,'' both about youths growing up in or near one of Chicago's most notorious housing projects, Ida B. Wells; ''The Sunshine Hotel,'' a portrait of men living in a Bowery flophouse, narrated by a longtime resident; and most recently ''Witness to an Execution,'' about men and women working on death row in Huntsville, Tex. Mr. Isay, who is 35, stumbled onto radio documentary production at age 22. At the time he was a student at New York University and living in the East Village, where he discovered a store selling inspirational  items for recovering addicts.

''They both had AIDS and weren't going to live very long. And they both had been heroin addicts. They showed me this model they did for a museum of addiction. They even had a tongue depressor mock-up and blueprints. It was incredibly moving.''  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

ISAY phoned local TV and radio stations, suggesting that a segment on the shop would be an offbeat human-interest story. No one was interested. Then he contacted a listener-sponsored station, WBAI. ''They said: 'It sounds great, but we don't have anyone who can do it. Why don't you do it yourself?' '' Mr. Isay said. ''So I picked up a tape recorder and went over there and, at that moment, when I pressed play-record and they started talking, I knew I had found my thing.'' After one broadcast on WBAI, National Public Radio acquired the documentary for ''All Things Considered.'' Compared to film and video, radio production is cheap, but a documentary can take up to a year to make and cost up to $60,000. The person responsible for handling the financial end of things at Sound Portraits is Stacy Abramson, 29, the company's managing editor and educational director. Some of Sound Portraits' annual budget of $250,000 is raised through contributions; the rest is begged, borrowed and scraped together through a patchwork quilt of public and private grants. The company also gives extended life to its projects through books, CD's and other materials. Last June, Mr. Isay was awarded a $500,000 MacArthur Fellowship. ''We went into the black for first time in 14 years,'' he said. ''We went from a hovel on 12th Street, where we were totally on top of each other, to this relatively luxurious empire.'' Most of Sound Portraits' productions are broadcast on the program ''All Things Considered,'' which pays $100 to $200 per minute of air time. At these rates, the most a 30-minute documentary could fetch is $6,000. The audience is good. ''All Things Considered'' reaches eight million people through 500 stations in North America, and the prestige is hard to equal. In addition, the program's executive producer, Ellen Weiss, is a fan. ''They just know how to tell a story better than anyone else out there,'' Ms. Weiss said. ''And they have the ability and talent to focus on a single story for a very long time.'' By investing so much time in each project, she added, ''They also get to know their characters in a way that lifts the veil off people. Subjects become comfortable with them, so the productions are much deeper than a lot of what is out there.''

One of its recent projects, ''Teenage Diaries,'' recorded the lives of teenagers around country and their feelings on everything from sexuality to cliques to school athletics. Both companies, Ms. Weiss said, ''find strong and dynamic characters to be their narrators.'' Typically, radio documentarians spend hundreds of hours with their subjects, who often become friends and sometimes co-producers. ''The best thing is watching how people grow up or change,'' said Ms. Abramson of Sound Portraits. ''We structured this company so we could stay with people's lives.  ''It's almost journalism-slash-therapy,'' she added. ''By giving someone a microphone, you're giving them a voice. TV and film companies don't usually do that.''
