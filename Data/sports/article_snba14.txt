Only one home run number now remains untaken from 1 to 60; more gaps exist from 61 to 73. Here’s a closer look at all the numbers, and some stories behind them. Image Credit Getty Images 1 (7,814 instances in which a player had a one-homer season) Duane Kuiper had the ultimate one-homer season because it gave him the record for the most career at-bats (3,379) with a single home run. In 1977 while playing for Cleveland, he homered in his 1,382nd at-bat. He then went the rest of his career, 1,997 at-bats, without hitting another one. Image 2 (4,340) Tommy Brown homered twice in 1945 for the Brooklyn Dodgers at the age of 17, making him the youngest (17 years 257 days) and second youngest (17 years 262 days) player to homer in the majors. 3 (3,051) Jimmie Reese, who roomed briefly with Babe Ruth while with the Yankees, hit three home runs in 1930 and three in 1931. 4 (2,277) Mike Cameron, who once hit four home runs in one game, hit four homers for Boston in 2010. 5 (1,844) B. J. Surhoff has the most seasons with five home runs; he did it six times, with Milwaukee and Baltimore. 6 (1,582) Rusty Staub was 19 when he hit six home runs for Houston in 1963. Staub, Gary Sheffield and Ty Cobb are the only players to homer before age 20 and after age 40. 7 (1,308) Bob Uecker hit seven home runs for Philadelphia in 1966, but when asked to list his greatest achievements as a player, he said, “Getting out of a rundown, and driving home the winning run by walking with the bases loaded.” 8 (1,183) Image Credit Getty Images Dave Hansen, above, hit eight home runs for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2000. Seven came as a pinch-hitter, which set the single-season record (the Pirates’ Craig Wilson matched that total one year later). 9 (1,025) Wes Ferrell holds the record for most home runs in a season by a pitcher. He hit nine for the Cleveland Indians in 1931. 10 (861) Carl Yastrzemski hit 10 for Boston in 1983, his last season. 11 (788) If you had picked up a Major League Baseball record book in April 1921, the listing under “Most Home Runs in a Career by a Player Since 1900” would have read, “Gavvy Cravath, 119.” If you had picked up the record book the following April, the listing would have been “Babe Ruth, 162.” Cravath hit 11 in 1912 for the Philadelphia Phillies. 12 (792) Don Money hit 12 for Milwaukee in 1976, but he lost a home run on April 10 in a bizarre manner. Money appeared to hit a game-ending grand slam against the Yankees, but the Yankees’ manager, Billy Martin, argued that his first baseman, Chris Chambliss, had called timeout before the pitch. “We were already back in the clubhouse drinking our first beer,” said Money’s teammate Gorman Thomas. The teams were ordered back to the field, where the Yankees went on to win the game, 9-7. 13 (620) In 1903, Buck Freeman of the Boston Americans had a lucky 13; it led the American League. 14 (612) Roger Maris hit 14 as a rookie with Cleveland in 1957. Image 15 (545) Cy Williams led the National League in home runs with 15 in 1920 while playing for the Philadelphia Phillies. 16 (496) Of the major-league- leading 16 home runs Sam Crawford hit for Cincinnati in 1901, 12 never left the park. 17 (435) Angel Berroa hit 17 home runs for Kansas City while winning the 2003 American League Rookie of the Year award. 18 (421) Kevin Kouzmanoff hit 18 for San Diego in 2007 and 2009. But it was his first major league home run, with Cleveland in 2006, that made headlines because it was a grand slam on the first pitch he ever saw. 19 (332) Gary Matthews and his son, Gary Matthews Jr., each had seasons of 19 home runs. Gary Sr. did it in 1980 with Atlanta and in 1982 with Philadelphia, and Gary Jr. did it with Texas in 2006. 20 (357) Lou Gehrig hit 20 for the Yankees in 1925, the season his consecutive-game streak started. 21 (339) High Pockets Kelly hit 21 for the 1924 New York Giants and became the first to homer in six consecutive games. 22 (296) Bryce Harper hit 22 homers for Washington in 2012. Only Tony Conigliaro, who hit 24 for Boston in 1964, had more as a 19-year-old. 23 (263) Joe Charboneau won the American League Rookie of the Year award in 1980 on the strength of his 23 home runs for Cleveland. 24 (260) Ken Boyer hit 24 home runs in four straight seasons, 1961 to 1964, with St. Louis. 25 (235) Image Credit Getty Images Bo Jackson, above, homered 25 times for Kansas City in 1988 and also scored three touchdowns for the Los Angeles Raiders that year. 26 (205) Image Credit Associated Press Hank Aaron (1956 Milwaukee Braves, left), Hank Bauer (1956 Yankees), Hank Sauer (1957 New York Giants) and Hank Thompson (1954 New York Giants) all had 26-homer seasons. 27 (215) Dale Long hit 27 for Pittsburgh in 1956, the season he hit home runs in eight consecutive games (eight home runs in all). Since then, the mark has been matched by Don Mattingly, with the Yankees in 1987 (10 home runs in eight games), and Ken Griffey Jr., with Seattle in 1993 (eight home runs). 28 (167) Johnny Mize won his first of four career home run titles when he hit 28 for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1939. 29 (144) Ted Williams and Raul Ibanez share the record for the most home runs in a season by a player age 40 or older. They each hit 29 at the age of 41. Williams did it with Boston in 1960 and Ibanez with Seattle in 2013. 30 (126) Dusty Baker hit the 30 mark on the last day of the season in 1977 for the Dodgers, and it put him and teammates Steve Garvey, Reggie Smith and Ron Cey in the record book. It made the Dodgers the first team in history to have four players with at least 30 home runs in the same season. 31 (135) Ted Williams hit 31 as a rookie with Boston in 1939. On Sept. 17, he hit one off Thornton Lee of the Chicago White Sox. Williams would also homer off Thornton’s son, Don Lee, pitching for the Washington Senators 21 years later. 32 (137) At the age of 20 (20 years 270 days to be exact), Tony Conigliaro hit a league-leading 32 home runs for Boston in 1965, making him the youngest home run champion in history. 33 (99) Gus Zernial started the 1951 season with the Chicago White Sox, was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics after four games and went on to hit 33 home runs to lead the American League. 34 (100) Image Credit Getty Images Fernando Tatis, above, hit 34 for St. Louis in 1999. Three of those were grand slams, and two of them came in the same inning against Los Angeles on April 23, a record. 35 (74) Hal Trosky picked a bad year for his rookie season in 1934.Trosky hit 35 home runs for Cleveland, but Lou Gehrig hit 49 for the Yankees. Trosky had 142 runs batted in, but Gehrig had 166. 36 (67) Image Credit Getty Images At left, Steve Finley’s 36th home run of the season, a grand slam, sealed a seven-run ninth-inning rally and gave the Dodgers a victory over San Francisco and the 2004 National League West title. 37 (60) Ralph Kiner won his record-setting seventh consecutive home run title in 1952 with 37 for Pittsburgh. Babe Ruth did it six straight seasons. 38 (51) Wally Berger hit a rookie-record 38 home runs in 1930 for the Boston Braves. Berger and Frank Robinson, who tied him in 1956 in his Cincinnati debut, share the National League record. 39 (55) Ken Williams of the St. Louis Browns hit 39 home runs to go with 37 steals in 1922, becoming the first player with at least 30 homers and 30 steals in a season. 40 (50) Darrell Evans hit 40 for Detroit in 1985 to lead the American League, becoming the first player to hit 40 or more homers in each league, having hit 41 for Atlanta 12 years before. 41 (39) Image Credit Getty Images Todd Hundley (in 1996) and Carlos Beltran (2006), above, are the only switch-hitters to hit 41 home runs, and they both did it for the Mets. 42 (36) Rogers Hornsby hit 42 with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1922 while hitting .401. He is the only player to hit .400 while homering at least 40 times. 43 (23) Javy Lopez hit 43 home runs for Atlanta in 2003 and 42 came as a catcher, setting the single-season mark. (He hit one home run as a pinch-hitter.) 44 (28) Hank Aaron hit 44 home runs four times (1957, 1963, 1966, 1969); three times this total led the National League. 45 (20) When Johnny Bench hit 45 home runs for Cincinnati in 1970, he hit 38 of them as a catcher, 1 as a first baseman, 5 as a left fielder and 1 as a right fielder. 46 (21) When Joe DiMaggio hit 46 home runs for the Yankees in 1937, he struck out 37 times. When Adam Dunn hit 46 for Cincinnati in 2004, he struck out 195 times. 47 (22) Image Credit Associated Press Reggie Jackson, above, finished with 47 home runs in 1969 for Oakland after hitting 37 before the All-Star Game, a major league record at the time. Harmon Killebrew, with Minnesota, ended up the American League home run leader with 49. 48 (11) There are 11 instances of a player hitting 48 home runs, and nine times it was good enough to lead the league. But Albert Belle, with Cleveland in 1996, and Frank Howard, with the Washington Senators in 1969, were outhomered. 49 (19) Mark McGwire, with Oakland in 1987, set the rookie record for home runs in a season with 49. 50 (6) Even with the 50 home runs he hit in 1996 with Baltimore, Brady Anderson averaged just 19 a season in his career. 51 (5) Willie Mays legged out 13 triples to go with his 51 home runs in 1955 for the New York Giants. 52 (6) Mickey Mantle hit 52 for the Yankees in 1956, winning the American League triple crown along the way. 53 (1) Last year, the Orioles’ Chris Davis, left, became the first batter to hit exactly 53 home runs in a season. He also tied Reggie Jackson’s American League record for most homers before the All-Star Game, with 37. 54 (7) David Ortiz homered 54 times for Boston in 2006; 47 came as a designated hitter, setting a record. 56 (3) Ken Griffey Jr. did it twice, in 1997 and 1998 with Seattle. 57 (2) When Luis Gonzalez hit 57 for the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, it wasn’t even good enough to lead the National League. He was third behind Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa. 58 (4) When Jimmie Foxx of the Philadelphia Athletics hit 58 home runs in 1932, he also collected 213 hits. He is one of four players with 50 home runs and 200 hits in the same season. 59 (1) Image Credit The New York Times Archive Babe Ruth, above, hit 59 for the Yankees in 1921, the season he spent a day in jail. Ruth was arrested for speeding in June (his second offense). He was taken to court, fined $100 and sentenced to a “day” in a downtown jail. But the jail day ended at 4 p.m., some 45 minutes after the Yankee game began. His Yankee uniform was brought to the jail. At 4 o’clock, he hurried to his car, already surrounded by a police motorcycle escort that whisked him to the Polo Grounds in 18 minutes. 60 (1) Babe Ruth became the first player to hit the 60 mark when he did it for the Yankees in 1927. Boston Red Sox pitchers allowed 11 of them. 61 (1) Roger Maris hit 61 for the Yankees in 1961 to break Babe Ruth’s record. But Maris’s feat went into the record book with this notation: *Hit 61 home runs in 1961 in a 162-game season. The asterisk was inserted to distinguish Maris’s home run record from the one set in 1927 by Ruth, who hit 60 in the days of the 154-game season. 63 (1) Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs homered 63 times in 1999 and, along with Mark McGwire, became the first to hit 60 or more homers in two seasons. But he did not win the National League home run title either time. 64 (1) Sosa put on a personal home run derby in 2001, hitting 64, and became the first player to hit 60 or more home runs three times. He also became the first player to hit three home runs in a game three times in a season. But still, no home run title. 65 (1) McGwire homered 65 times for St. Louis in 1999, the year after setting the single-season home run record. 66 (1) Sosa hit 66 in 1998. Twenty of the home runs came in June, setting a record for the most home runs in one month. The previous record-holder was Rudy York, who hit 18 for Detroit in August 1937. 70 (1) McGwire set the standard for most home runs in a season when he hit 70 for St. Louis in 1998. He finished with a record-low ratio of 7.27 at-bats per home run. 73 (1) Three seasons after McGwire broke the single-season home run record, Barry Bonds set the new mark, hitting 73 for San Francisco. Bonds’s ratio of 6.52 at-bats per home run broke another McGwire record. 55, 62,67,68,69,71,72 UP FOR GRABS: No player has hit exactly 55 home runs in a season, or any of these other highlighted numbers. Of course, any number above Barry Bonds’s 73 is also available for the taking.
