Included are the date the individual policemen joined the force, their educational backgrounds and certifications and their law-enforcement specialties - such as burglary investigation and crime-scene analysis. The biographies are accompanied in most cases by a photograph of the officer being discussed. ''There are only two cases where there are no pictures,'' said Officer  Richard W. Dwyer , who put together the book. Mr. Dwyer said that the department members realized there could be some risks associated with being identified but that ''they felt so strong about it that they didn't care,'' adding that ''we don't want to be hiding in corners.'' Mr. Dwyer, a lifelong resident of Bedford and a 13-year member of the police force, conceived of the idea for the directory last year when he was president of the Bedford Police Benevolent Association. He said he believed it to be the first publication of its type in the county. ''I had been approached by a professional fund- raising group that wanted to put out a journal and solicit ads,'' he explained. ''But it made me feel bad that a police department would get involved in that kind of solicitation. I think it undoes more than it does. We've taken so many strides in professionalism in law enforcement that this would seem to be a giant step backward.''

Marden and then Town Supervisor  Robert D. Hazzard that, besides the preparation and distribution, the P.B.A. would pay half of the $7,000 it would cost to print 9,000 to 10,000 copies of the work if the town would provide the other half of the money. The officials readily agreed.

Last month, his efforts came to fruition: the publication was made available at the Town Hall and the Police Headquarters - as well as through churches and schools - to a public that Mr. Dwyer said was ''extremely pleased to receive the information.'' The booklet is dedicated, not only to ''those law- enforcement officers who served so well here in Bedford,'' but to all law-enforcement officers - ''the thin blue line that stands between civilization and anarchy.'' It is also dedicated to those who have defended the nation. Mr. Dwyer said that while he was writing the dedication the massacre at the American military compound in Lebanon occurred. ''I started to realize how Mr. Reagan said that it was a police action over there,'' he explained, '' and how the Marines were acting as police officers.'' And what did those on the police force think of Mr. Dwyer's opus, which also discusses the operations of the various components sectors of the Police Department? ''I think its a nice book,'' said Sgt.  Anthony Costanzo , who, while noting that his name was misspelled, added: ''I'm happy with my picture.''  - Gary Kriss In his time,  Sal J. Prezioso has been many things, including the first executive officer of the county's Department of Parks and Recreation, first Commissioner of the state's Office of Parks and Recreation and the City Manager of Yonkers. He is now vice president of public-service programs at Pace University. But according to  John J. Blanchfield , executive director of Westchester's Senior Employment Personnel Council, one of Dr. Prezioso's more important accomplishments has been to ''epitomize what our organization is talking about.'' In recognition of that, the council will honor Dr. Prezioso at its third yearly Senior Service Award breakfast Friday at the White Plains Hotel. Calling Dr. Prezioso's selection by the council's board of directors ''an excellent, excellent choice,'' Dr. Blanchfield said that Dr. Prezioso symbolized the aims of the council, a White Plains-based, nonprofit employment service for those 60 years old or older. Since its founding in 1955, he said, it has interviewed more than 17,000 elderly people and found paid positions for more than 65 percent of them, returning more than $40 million to the county's economy through those salaries. ''He's an older person who has kept active when most people his age may be basking in the sunlight someplace else,'' Dr. Blanchfield said of the 70- year-old Dr. Prezioso. ''But he still has something to contribute. We want older people to remain in the mainstream.''

The breakfast, from 8 to 9:30 A.M., is $25; for reservations, call the council at 761-2150 through Wednesday. Among the scheduled guests are former Governor  Malcolm Wilson , County Executive  Andrew P. O'Rourke and the Pace University president,  Edward J. Mortola . The award itself, a rendering of Dr. Prezioso, will be presented by the council's president,  Anita C. Jankowski .   - Gary Kriss  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

It was a strong move, one of many good moves that had put Richard a bishop and knight ahead of his opponent. However, it was the timing of the move that was ultimately significant. The official clock on his United States Chess Federation National Finals match had expired before he completed his move, thereby negating his winning effort. But more important than the individual setback was the showing made by Richard and his teammates from the Ridgeway School in White Plains at the match last Saturday in Syracuse. In its first national competition, and in its first year as an organized chess team, the group of six players - the other members being  Amy Berezin ,  Justin and  Marcel Collazo , and  Julie and  Matthew Goldman - placed fourth in a field of 30 in the finals of the primary category: third grade and under. And according to the team's coach,  Sunil Weeramantry , the way that 9-year-old Richard handled and accepted the judges' decision - a victory would have placed his team third overall - was an admirable example of what the effort to introduce chess to younger players is all about. ''It's a difficult thing for them to understand, for every child loves to win,'' said Mr. Weeramantry, who is himself an International Federation of Chess Master and an active player. ''But through their involvement, they are able to realize that it is the playing of the game that matters.'' The centuries-old game continues to attract younger players, and the national chess federation has recognized that influx by creating two separate categories for young players this year. For the first time in national competition, the primary grades - third and under - played separately from the elementary category (grades four through six). Because Mr. Weeramantry could not attend the match, he asked Stanley Kim, a 15-year-old former national champion from Hastings-on-Hudson, to stand in as coach for the Ridgeway team. Mr. Weeramantry has played the central role in motivating more than 60 students at the four White Plains elementary schoo4s in after-school chess clubs since he began coaching there last November. It was  Bonnie Ackerman , one of two instructors with the district's More Able Student Program, who laid the groundwork. ''I've been teaching chess for many years to all my students as a critical thinking tool and as a challenging way for them to learn concentration and self-discipline,'' Miss Ackerman said. ''But I wasn't able to teach them very much; I'm not very good.'' She said that Mr. Weeramantry, a 32-year- old from Sri Lanka who has lived here since 1974, is more than a good instructor and coach because his enthusiasm and perseverance has provided a role model for the youngsters.

What was even nicer, he said, was to see the four trophies the team has won in tournament play sitting alongside athletic awards in the school's display case. ''It's important for the kids to understand that intellectual endeavors can be rewarded the same way as athletics,'' Mr. Weeramantry said.   - John B. O'Mahoney ''Put a dollar bill between your teeth, get all you can carry in your hands for $1.'' ''Every red book 5 cents for the next five minutes.'' ''All the books you can fit in a paper bag, $1 for the next 10 minutes.'' These are some of the announcements book lovers will be hearing of the 25th Scholarship Book Fair to be held by the Westchester Vassar Club May 16 through 20, noon through 8 P.M. at the County Center in White Plains. The event, which is free of charge, raises money for scholarships to Vasser for Westchester residents. Last year, more than $20,000 was collected. The Westchester Vassar Club, which has 100 members, has been running a book sale for 25 years. The first one was held under a large tent at a shopping center and was hampered by a drenching rain. This is the fourth year at the County Center. There, visitors will find 50,000 novels and works of nonfiction, including special collectors items such as an original copy of Thornton Wilder's ''Ides of March.'' Prices range from 25 cents for some paperbacks to more than $100 for rare works, with most books going for several dollars. The sale takes all year to organize, according to its coordinator,  Brenda Oestreich , who graduated from Vassar in 1957. ''We're always getting calls from people who are moving and want to donate books,'' she explained. ''People just seem to know of us. The books are dropped off at two members' homes and at a local college, which serve as collection centers. Volunteers spend time there, organizing and packing. Then, before the sale, truckers are hired to transport the books to the County Center.'' She paused. ''The alumni are a dedicated group. I know I had a fantastic education and I appreciated that, and I've been loyal ever since.''  - Lynne Ames    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
