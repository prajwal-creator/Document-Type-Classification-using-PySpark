Credit Laurent Gillieron/Keystone, via Associated Press     Happy Friday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The heads of Citi and Goldman took home healthy pay raises last year. • Qualcomm didn’t categorically say no to Broadcom’s latest offer. • What financial regulation could look like post-Brexit. • Look who bet big on a pick-up in volatility...Peter Thiel. • R.I.P., BTFD? • Kraft Heinz is due for a big deal. • U.S. Bancorp’s big fine. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up . Breaking down how golden bank C.E.O.s’ pay was The good times that returned to Wall Street after President Donald Trump got elected are now flowing into the pockets of the big banks’ C.E.Os: • Citigroup’s Mike Corbat saw his compensation jump 48 percent last year, to $23 million . • Goldman Sachs’s Lloyd Blankfein enjoyed a smaller 9 percent rise, to $24 million .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   • JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, we already know, received a 5 percent increase, to $29.5 million .  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       • Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, we also already know, enjoyed a 15 percent bump, to $23 million . Are those paydays justified? Let’s take Mr. Corbat. Citigroup’s stock rose 25 percent in 2017, a lot more than the 16 percent posted by the KBW Bank Index. Investors piled into bank stocks because of expectations of stronger economic growth, and also because they expected the Trump administration to loosen banking regulations. Citi’s underlying businesses improved last year. The bank also got through the Federal Reserve’s stress tests in 2017 without objections from the regulator, something it had struggled to do in previous years. The message from Citi’s board seems to be that, since the bank’s performance is now much closer to that of its peers, Mr. Corbat’s pay also needs to be in the vicinity of his counterparts on Wall Street. But on other yardsticks, the awards can seem high Citi may be doing better than in the past, but its return on equity, a metric that shows a bank’s return on its capital, was only 6.6 percent last year. Bank of America’s was 6.7 percent. Both are well below the 10 percent earned at JPMorgan. And the makeup of the compensation matters C.E.O.s’ compensation is made up of different types of pay: • Cash salaries and cash bonuses • Stock-based bonuses that are paid out over the coming years, and whose value is, to differing degrees, dependent on how the company performs in the future. The theory: The more performance-related pay, the more accountable the executive is. Investors should keep an eye on the amount of performance share units (P.S.U.s) that are included in a comp package, since these are usually the type of stock award that are most at risk of a decline in value if a bank underperforms by certain yardsticks.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   • Mr. Dimon’s pay appears most dependent on P.S.U.s. They made up 78 percent of his 2017 comp. Mr. Blankfein is close behind with 73 percent . • By contrast, Mr. Moynihan had 47 percent of his comp in P.S.U.s. Mr. Corbat had just 33 percent . Bank of America and Citi would likely assert that the rest of their stock-based awards are also somewhat dependent on the performance of the bank. But shareholders might be happier if all the stock bonus were in P.S.U.s. J ust for context: Median household income in the United States was just shy of $60,000 in 2016. — Peter Eavis  Photo         Credit Ariel Schalit/Associated Press    The sale of Scaramucci’s SkyBridge stake finally gets a review. After months of delays, the panel that reviews foreign takeovers of U.S. businesses has agreed to review Anthony Scaramucci’s deal to sell his stake in SkyBridge Capital to China’s HNA Group, Bloomberg reports . • Mr. Scaramucci agreed a year ago to sell his investment firm to a subsidiary of HNA Group as he prepared to take a job in the Trump Administration. • The decision starts a maximum 75-day clock for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, to decide whether to approve or oppose the deal, Bloomberg reports. • Chinese investors have faced heightened scrutiny from Cfius. Since president Trump took office, a half a dozen Chinese deals have fallen apart because of concerns raised by CFIUS, Bloomberg reports.

While $82 a share isn’t enough , Qualcomm decided after its Valentine’s Day meeting with its unwanted suitor, the chip maker left the door open for potential agreement.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   • Raising the breakup fee for antitrust reasons beyond $8 billion. That amount, which represents an already high 6.6 percent of the total deal price, still isn’t high enough for Qualcomm. “A breakup fee in the range proposed by Broadcom does not come close to compensating for those risks,” Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s chairman, writes in a letter to Broadcom’s chief, Hock Tan. • Make unspecified other commitments meant to assuage antitrust regulators. • Clarify what Broadcom’s intentions are for Qualcomm’s big licensing business. More from Mr. Jacobs’s letter: Our board is open to further discussions with Broadcom to see if a proposal that appropriately reflects the true value of Qualcomm shares, and ensures an appropriate level of deal certainty, can be obtained. If the two sides can’t reach an agreement, then matters may come down to a vote on Qualcomm’s board on March 6. Remember that Broadcom is seeking six of 11 board seats, down from its initial target of unseating all directors. Remember: Broadcom has said that its second offer of $82 a share is “best and final.” The status quo: Shares in Qualcomm were little changed, while those in Broadcom were down slightly. In other Qualcomm news: Elliott Advisors, which owns about 7.2 percent of NXP Semiconductors, renewed its argument that Qualcomm should pay more than $110 a share for the smaller chip maker, especially in light of NXP’s recent quarterly earnings. — Michael de la Merced  Photo         Credit Leon Neal/Getty Images    What financial regulation could look like post-Brexit. Britain’s government is often criticized for not clearly communicating the type of deal it wants to strike with the European Union as it prepares to leave the bloc. But, according to a report in the Financial Times on Friday , Britain will soon lay out its post-Brexit vision for financial services, a huge earner for the country. The plan centers on Britain and the E.U. mutually recognizing each other’s financial regulations. The dilemma Britain faces. Post-Brexit, Britain’s banks and financial firms would lose special rights that allow them to operate in any E.U. country with few restrictions. Britain could fall back on an arrangement that would allow British banks to do business in the E.U. if they operated under regulations that were equivalent to those in the bloc. But this arrangement has drawbacks. It does not cover important types of financial activities, and British banks may have to comply with any changes to regulation that the E.U. introduces.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Hence the new plan. The scheme that Britain may now propose appears designed to address those problems. It would allow both sides leeway to strike their own rules once they’ve agreed on their main objectives. And it suggests that a monitoring regime and mechanism for resolving disputes be set up. Will the E.U. agree to the plan? The bloc may reject such a proposal because it would risk losing some control over financial regulation. Certain politicians in the E.U. may argue Britain is trying to retain the privileges of the single market while discarding the duties that come with it. Still, some of Europe’s leaders, banks and businesses may support the plan, in the belief that it will minimize disruption and allow the City of London to continue to play a big role in financing the strong economic expansion taking place in Europe. —Peter Eavis  Photo         Credit Andrew White for The New York Times    Look who bet big on a pick-up in volatility... Peter Thiel. Bloomberg reports that the venture capitalist known for his investments in Facebook and PayPal had a $244 million bet at the end of 2017 tied to the C.B.O.E Volatility index, or VIX. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Thiel Macro, which invests Mr. Thiel’s fortune, held put options on 1.9 million shares of ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures as of Dec. 31. The investment is designed to pay off if the VIX rises. It’s unclear whether the fund had maintained those positions through last week. But if it had, he would have reaped a big windfall. Investors piled into bets that volatility would continue to decline last year. And those wagers paid off as the VIX spent 2017 trading at historically low levels. But volatility has picked up this year. After trading below 10 to start the year, the VIX spiked to above 37 during the selloff last week. It finished Friday at 19. We should have seen this coming Vice reports that virtual currencies are now becoming an issue in ... divorce cases : The law firm Royds Withy King says it has seen a flurry of cases recently involving disputes over cryptocurrency holdings, one of which was recently valued at $1.4 million.  The firm said it is currently working on three separate high-value divorce cases where spouses are seeking the disclosure and a potential share of cryptocurrency assets. Off the top of our heads, we’d think that issues would include a) the reporting, or lack thereof, of holdings and b) the value of any digital money portfolios. — Michael de la Merced  Photo         Credit Richard Drew/Associated Press    Should we retire ‘buy the dip’? It’s age-old wisdom. But as investors worry about inflation and central banks raising interest rates unexpectedly quickly, is it still relevant ?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   More from Julie Edde, Bei Hu and Suzanne Woolley of Bloomberg: “There’s sort of, ‘Everybody should buy a dip,’ which has become folklore in the markets now. I would say history doesn’t tell you buying dips is always the right answer,” Man Group chief executive officer Luke Ellis said. Another investor, Ian Harnett of Absolute Strategy Research, recommends “sell the rallies” instead.

But some people worry all the same . The market historian James Stack told Jim Stewart of the NYT that high valuations and years of low interest rates mean “we’re dealing with what might be the most interest rate-sensitive stock market in our lifetime.” State of the markets: Asian indexes rose only slightly, in part because of Lunar New Year celebrations. European stocks rose. S. & P. 500 futures are up strongly.  Photo         Credit Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters    When will Kraft Heinz strike its next big deal? That question’s sure to greet the company’s C.E.O., Bernardo Hees, during earnings discussions this morning. What’s curious is that he hinted at the topic during a pre-earnings presentation yesterday. “With our global presence and financial strength, I think that we’ll continue to generate opportunities for us to expand our portfolio,” he said, a ccording to Annie Gasparro of the WSJ . Why another deal? It’s what Kraft Heinz and its backers at 3G do best. Meanwhile, sales have been declining, and the company’s last big takeover attempt, at Unilever two years ago, fizzed quickly.

More from Emily Flitter of the NYT: For about five years, senior bank employees tried to balance their security system’s constant alerts about suspicious customer activity against internal staffing limitations, the authorities said. In a late-2009 memo, court documents show, U.S. Bank’s anti-money-laundering officer warned the chief compliance officer that employees responsible for investigating the alerts were “stretched dangerously thin.” The upside: U.S. Bancorp’s actions weren’t as bad as HSBC’s or Standard Charter’s.
