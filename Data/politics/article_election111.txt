Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Here are the details: Underwriters: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Allen & Co. BofA Merrill Lynch, RBC Capital, Jefferies, Macquarie Capital, Canaccord Genuity, JMP Securities, KeyBanc Capital and Piper Jaffray. Exchange: Nasdaq Capital structure: Class B shares will have 10 times the voting power of Class common shares. The holders of Class B shares will continue to control the company after it goes public. Last summer the FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s said most newly public companies with dual or multi-class capital structures would not be included in their indexes. Big shareholders: Drew Houston, the co-founder and chief executive, has 24.4 percent of the voting power, while venture capital firm Sequoia Capital has 24.8 percent. Mr. Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, a co-founder, have a combined voting power of 34.3 percent, which is greater than 32.3 percent for the three outside investors listed in the offering document. Executive compensation: Mr. Houston’s total pay last year was more than $110 million, including more $109 million in stock awards. His base salary was $400,000. Mr. Ferdowsi’s total compensation was $47.3 million. The financials: In 2017, Dropbox lost $112 million but its cash flows totaled $330 million. The reasons for the difference: Dropbox had large noncash expenses, like stock compensation and depreciation and amortization. But revenue growth is slowing. Dropbox took in $1.1 billion of revenue in 2017, a 31 percent increase from $845 million in 2016. The company’s revenue surged by 40 percent in 2016. Dropbox will have to convince investors that it can add new paying users at a fast clip. It had 11 million paying users in 2017, up 25 percent from 2016. But that was a significantly slower pace than the 35 percent increase in 2016.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In theory, Dropbox could squeeze more revenue out of each user, but it has not managed to do that in recent years. Revenue-per-user was $111.91 last year, not that different from $110.54 in 2016 and $113.54 in 2015. Valuation: Early investors in unicorns are obviously betting that their stake will be worth more when the company goes public. But Dropbox’s investors might be disappointed. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the offering will value Dropbox at $7 billion to $8 billion. That is below the implied $10 billion valuation for Dropbox when it raised money in 2014, the Journal reported. Shira Ovide at Bloomberg’s Gadfly uses a valuation for Box, a public company that stores and manages content in the cloud, as a guide for how much Dropbox might be worth on the stock market. Ms. Ovide’s conclusion is not encouraging.   Hard truths for Dropbox: Box trades at 5x forward revenue. If Dropbox grows at the same rate as 2017 to $1.45B, then it's valuation would be ~$7 billion. Not what Dropbox wants. —
        Shira Ovide (@ShiraOvide) Feb. 23, 2018     — Peter Eavis and Stephen Grocer  Photo         Credit Ty Wright for The New York Times    Will Wall Street act if Washington won’t? A series of companies has severed their relationship with the National Rifle Association after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., following pressure from customers. Andrew highlighted how financial companies could limit the sale of guns in his column on Tuesday, causing debate on both sides and prompting petitions to begin circulating . On Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew its agreement to issue an N.R.A.-branded Visa card. “Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the N.R.A.,” the bank said. And Enterprise, which owns two other rental car brands, Alamo and National , said it would stop offering a special discount for N.R.A. members. Andrew notes: It took real leadership for Clark Lauritzen, First National Bank’s president, to make this decision. Will other C.E.O.’s who talk about social responsibility follow suit? Mr. Lauritzen’s bank is privately held by his family, so it may have been easier for him to take such a stand.  Visa tried to distance itself from all of this by saying, “Visa co-branded cards do not represent an endorsement by Visa of that cause or organization.” But it also appears unwilling to sign on to the idea I proposed that it prevent customers from using its network to buy assault weapons, high-caliber magazines and bump stocks when it said in its statement about First National Bank ending its deal with the N.R.A., “We strive to make our payment services available to all people in all places, for uses consistent with local, national, and international laws.” The context Groups have previously pushed the investment industry to dump gun stocks, with limited impact. Pension funds, including those for public-school teachers in at least a dozen states, own shares in gun makers . And major money managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard are indirectly some of the biggest holders of gun stocks through exchange-traded funds. BlackRock says it can’t divest shares of a company in an index, but with $6 trillion under management, it is often effectively the biggest investor in such businesses.

BlackRock said it planned to reach out to weapons makers “to understand their response” to the shootings.

Credit Getty Images    Britain wants its cake in Brexit talks. Top members of the British government met Thursday to agree on what sort of relationship they want to have with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc. The B.B.C. has details of the meal that was served at the meeting, held at the official country retreat of Prime Minister Theresa May: A cream of sweetcorn soup with a ham hock croquette, a Guinness short rib of Dexter beef with onions and parsnip mash, and a lemon tart with raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries. The menu is a reminder of how often food is used to help understand Brexit. Cherries: The British government’s position seems to be that it wants to abide by some European Union rules that would be advantageous for trade, while discarding others. In the Brexit debate, Britain’s attempts to pick and choose is commonly described as cherry-picking , and top officials of the European Union have said they won’t let Britain take this approach. And for Britain to ask for three baskets of cherries is likely just too much for the European Union to stomach. Why? Cake: The rationale for not letting Britain take an à la carte approach is that it allows the country to have its cake and eat it . Underpinning the European Union is the belief that the benefits of being more closely integrated are often obtained through compromises that all member countries must make. And to supporters of the bloc, Britain’s desire to opt in for some things and not others corrodes that community spirit. The cake and cherries rhetoric thrown around in the Brexit debate suggest there is little middle ground between the European Union and Britain. But an alternative way to view the tensions is that so much trade goes on between Britain and the bloc, and others ties are so deep, that both sides will ultimately strike a new relationship that retains much of the existing one. As analysts at Nomura wrote earlier this week: In terms of the bespoke deal issue, we think it is not credible to say the U.K. can only take an off-the-shelf Norway / Switzerland / Turkey / Ukraine / Canada / Mexico deal. They were all bespoke deals when they were made. The idea that the world’s seventh largest economy, an ex-member and a country that will still have strong institutional, economic and geographic ties to the E.U. should not get a bespoke deal is not reasonable, in our view. And the Sun newspaper is reporting that some in European Union may actually want to throw Britain a few cherries. The Sun’s Nick Gutteridge , who often has fresh insights from Brussels, has details of a paper drafted by the Belgian government: The paper, produced by the Belgian government for a meeting of diplomats last week, will prove a huge boost to British negotiators and gives new insight into E.U. thinking. — Peter Eavis One reason the Treasury balked on Dodd Frank’s bank resolution regime. President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda seems to have met its match in the obscure world of international financial regulation. On Thursday, we wrote about the Treasury Department’s decision to retain the process for winding down a failing bank that was introduced under the Obama administration.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A big reason the Treasury held back: The concerns of foreign regulators. As the Treasury’s proposal stated , an alternative to the Obama-era wind-down is a new form of bankruptcy for large financial firms, called Chapter 14. The Treasury favors using Chapter 14 where possible, but it opted to keep the current resolution mechanism. This disappointed Republicans who want Chapter 14 to replace the the current process. But foreign regulators pushed back against a bankruptcy-or-nothing approach. Specifically, the Treasury noted, foreign regulators have expressed doubts about whether they could coordinate effectively with a United States bankruptcy judge when winding down a big American bank that has large amounts of business overseas. On that point, the Treasury could have pushed back. It could have told foreign governments that Chapter 14 judges would, in fact, be up to the task of handling international cases. Indeed, the Treasury in its paper said it expected the judges to have such competency: Further, these judges, once designated, could engage in planning and coordination exercises, including cross-border efforts (e.g., the crisis management groups discussed above). Instead, fearing higher costs for United States banks, the Treasury apparently gave the concerns of foreign regulators considerable weight and took an internationalist approach. — Peter Eavis  Photo         Credit Ralph Orlowski/Reuters    Geely has become Daimler’s biggest stakeholder. The Chinese manufacturer has built up a $9 billion stake, or just under 10 percent, in the German automaker and parent of Mercedes-Benz. From Bloomberg: The investment in the parent of Mercedes-Benz furthers Hangzhou-based Geely’s foray into the European premium automotive market and ends months of speculation. The Chinese company, controlled by billionaire Li Shufu, already owns Volvo Cars AB, whose refreshed line-up of vehicles have made it a popular alternative to the German luxury stalwarts. Geely also gained control of British sports-car maker Louts Cars last year.  Photo         Credit Karsten Moran for The New York Times    China now controls the Waldorf Astoria The government in Beijing seized control today of Anbang Insurance Group, the troubled Chinese company that owns the iconic New York hotel. The details • The Chinese insurance regulator said Anbang had violated regulations, putting into question its ability to pay claims. • A group that includes China’s central bank, its securities and banking regulators, the country’s foreign exchange regulator and other government agencies will oversee Anbang for a year. • The takeover could be extended if Anbang fails to complete an equity restructuring and resume operations. • The company’s former chairman was charged with financial crimes . The c ontext Anbang came under scrutiny for its opaque ownership structu r e and for the political ties of its former chairman as it embarked on a period of frenzied deal making.

Anbang and the other Chinese deal makers, which had borrowed heavily to fund their shopping sprees, soon drew attention from officials. State media labeled them “ gray rhinoceroses ” — big problems that are ignored until they start moving fast. Critics’ c orner • Quentin Webb of Breakingviews writes that the seizure is the boldest move yet in Beijing’s battle against financial excess, and the new precedent could be a worrying omen. • Anbang’s size and entanglements are comparable to Lehman Brothers or A.I.G. before the global financial crisis, and the insurer was always going to crash and burn if left untouched, writes Nisha Gopalan in Bloomberg Gadfly .

Credit Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press    Changes are afoot for failing banks The Treasury Department has proposed a regulatory move that would increase the likelihood that a failing bank would end up in bankruptcy rather than going through a resolution process overseen by the government. The tweak would still keep the emergency structures introduced as part of Dodd-Frank as an option. From the NYT’s Peter Eavis: Crucially, the Treasury also wants to keep the emergency government loan. But the Treasury’s proposal does introduce an important and innovative change. It calls for a special type of bankruptcy regime for large financial firms, called Chapter 14. This new regime envisions having a set of specialist judges, working with regulators in the United States and around the world, who could plan for and oversee the bankruptcies of large banks.
