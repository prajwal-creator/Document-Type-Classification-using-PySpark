Greece won’t have a fresh bailout proposal for eurozone leaders to consider when they meet today in Brussels. The delay of a plan to Wednesday apparently led some European finance ministers to express frustration over the debt negotiations that broke off nearly two weeks ago. We are following developments live . • Lowering the flag? The South Carolina Senate gave its final approval today to legislation to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the State House, sending the bill to the state’s House of Representatives, where the outcome is less certain. Before the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston less than a month ago, removing the flag appeared politically impossible.

The Senate considers a major bipartisan education bill that rewrites the No Child Left Behind law , shifting responsibility for public school standards back to the states, rather than keeping them with the federal government.

Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testify this morning before Congress on the strategy against Islamic State militants . • At the White House. President Obama holds talks today with Vietnam’s Communist Party chief, the country’s de facto leader. The meeting is driven by the two countries’ desire to forge an alliance that could counteract China’s rising power. Mr. Obama will have to wait for a potential landmark deal limiting Iran’s nuclear program , as talks were extended after negotiators acknowledged they would not meet today’s deadline. • The lives of the poor. The final report on the Millennium Development Goals, a set of targets created 15 years ago by the U.N., shows that global poverty has dropped sharply . World leaders are scheduled to adopt the U.N.’s next set of development goals by September. • Racial imbalance. A study out today shows that 66 percent of states that elect prosecutors have no African-Americans in those positions. Many experts say that prosecutors have more influence than police officers over the legal system. • Computer experts speak out.

Francisco Sanchez, 45, from Mexico, is arraigned today in San Francisco in the shooting death of Kathryn Steinle , 32, at a sightseeing pier last week.

Fourteen Kenyans were killed today in an attack by the Shabab, a Somali group. And Nigeria is counting the dead from almost daily attacks by extremists over the last week. In Britain, officials warn that the threat of terrorism has increased since 52 civilians were killed 10 years ago today in London. MARKETS • Samsung said today it most likely extended its two-year streak of shrinking profits in the second quarter. Sales also probably fell, the company said in a preliminary report. • SurveyMonkey, the online survey and polling company, today named William Veghte from Hewlett-Packard as chief executive, replacing Dave Goldberg, who died in May . And Sheryl Sandberg , chief operating officer of Facebook and Mr. Goldberg’s widow, is taking her husband’s seat on the company’s board.

Jerry Weintraub , 77, a force in film and music who worked with Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Led Zeppelin, Steven Soderbergh, Robert Altman and Michael Douglas, died Monday in Santa Barbara, Calif. BACK STORY For the first time in 58 years, a new novel by Ayn Rand , the best-selling author and libertarian philosopher who died in 1982, is being published today.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ms. Rand brought her principles of individualism and capitalism together in a credo she called objectivism, whose disciples today include Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator.  Photo        "Ideal," by Ayn Rand, is published today.   Credit Associated Press    She used her major fictional works, “Atlas Shrugged” and “The Fountainhead,” to spread her views. “Ideal,” the book published today by the New American Library , is not exactly a treatise on self-interest. A thriller set in Hollywood, it revolves around a movie actress, Kay Gonda, who is accused of murder and is on the run. Ms. Rand wrote the novel when she was 29 and trying to make a living doing studio work in Los Angeles. But something about “Ideal” dissatisfied her, and she ended up reconfiguring it as a play. It was not produced until 1989, and made its New York debut in 2010 (to lukewarm reviews, at best). The Ayn Rand Institute discovered the novel among her papers three years ago. Today’s edition includes both the novel and the play. Victoria Shannon contributed reporting. Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated on the web all morning .
