The real-life models for the characters here include George Balanchine (a perfect Michael Cerveris, above, with Natalia Alonso as Maria Tallchief) and Igor Stravinsky (John Glover) (2:30). Mitzi E.

Previews and Openings ‘Charles Ives Take Me Home’ (in previews; opens on Thursday) Apparently being an insurance executive and a maverick American composer isn’t enough. Now Charles Ives is a family peacemaker too, courtesy of this new drama by Jessica Dickey (“The Amish Project”). Here Ives becomes a sort of metaphysical referee between a violinist dad and his basketball-loving daughter. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org . (Eric Grode) Clubbed Thumb Summerworks (previews start on Friday; opens on Monday) This prestigious three-play summer festival continues with “Phoebe in Winter,” by Jen Silverman. As a father awaits the return of his three sons from a distant war, a mysterious interloper (the title character) joins the family with profound consequences. Wild Project, 195 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, clubbedthumb.org . (Grode) ‘The Comedy of Errors’ (in previews; opens on June 18) The thought of an intermission-free Shakespeare is a daunting one, but the Public Theater promises just that with its production of this rarely produced comedy. Featuring the familiar faces of Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Hamish Linklater in duplicate (each plays a pair of twins), this lean-and-mean staging by Daniel Sullivan promises to have audiences out of Central Park in well under two hours. Delacorte Theater, Central Park, near 81st Street and Central Park West, (212) 539-8750, shakespeareinthepark.org . (Grode)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Cornelius’ (in previews; opens on Tuesday) J.B. Priestley is one of those relatively obscure playwrights whose works are dusted off and given a fresh new look every few years. Following past resuscitators like David Mamet (who adapted Priestley’s “Dangerous Corner” for the Atlantic Theater in 1995) and Stephen Daldry (who brought “An Inspector Calls” to Broadway in 1994) is 59E59 Theater’s Brits Off Broadway festival, which is presenting this 1935 Priestley rarity about love and regrets within a financially teetering import firm. Directed by Sam Yates. 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org . (Grode)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Ensemble Studio Theater 2013 Marathon (Series C) (previews start on Friday; opens on Sunday) The one-act play festival begins its third and final batch of works. The recent envelope-pushing playwrights Tommy Smith (“White Hot”) and Jon Kern (“Modern Terrorism”) appear this time around, along with the marathon’s éminence grise: Murray Schisgal, 85, who made his first big splash Off Broadway 50 years ago. Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org . (Grode) ‘The Explorers Club’ (in previews; opens on June 20) Nell Benjamin, who co-wrote the score to “Legally Blonde: The Musical,” once again takes on the humorous travails of a bright woman trying to surmount institutionalized sexism. Only this time she’s looking back about a century, to 1879 London, as the titular organization grapples with whether to allow a brilliant woman (Jennifer Westfeldt) into its ranks. Not even discovering a lost city, it seems, can guarantee membership. City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org . (Grode) ‘A Kid Like Jake’ (in previews; opens on June 17) As if the application process for New York private schools wasn’t daunting enough, one couple (Peter Grosz and the always welcome Carla Gugino) have to take into account their 4-year-old son’s predilection for Cinderella and playing dress up. Speaking of high expectations, this new Daniel Pearle play follows one of Lincoln Center Theater’s acclaimed productions, “Disgraced,” which played in this space last year and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama this year — the first to be given to a Lincoln Center production. Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com , lct3.org . (Grode) ‘Manna-Hata’ (previews start on Friday; opens on Monday) Let’s hear it for bureaucratic paralysis! Many had hoped the James A. Farley Post Office might have replaced Penn Station years ago. In the meantime it is playing host to Barry Rowell’s sprawling, immersive chronicle of 400 years in the life of New York City. Expect to see Boss Tweed, Shirley Chisholm, Peter Stuyvesant, Jane Jacobs, Walt Whitman, Dorothy Parker and many, many, many other quintessential New Yorkers. 425 Eighth Avenue, enter on 31st Street, (866) 811-4111, peculiarworks.org . (Grode) ‘A Picture of Autumn’ (in previews; opens on Monday) Even by Mint Theater standards, N.C. Hunter’s 1951 play qualifies as a rarity: the company is presenting the work’s American premiere. Hunter’s refined, tentative style became synonymous in some corners with everything that the Angry Young Men of mid-20th-century British theater opposed, but perhaps it’s time to revisit this piece here. It’s about a family trying to hold on to their decrepit ancestral home, and it gave London audiences their first glimpse of a playwright who would soon become an important, but now-forgotten, British dramatist in the 1950s and ’60s. Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org . (Grode) ‘Rantoul and Die’ (previews start on Wednesday; opens on June 24) The Amoralists, the dependably debauched theater company, hunker down for a two-play summer in New York. A new play by the company’s co-founder Derek Ahonen will come in July, but first they will present this biting romantic comedy by Mark Roberts, better known as the creator of the CBS sitcom “Mike and Molly.” Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, amoralists.com . (Grode) ‘Reasons to Be Happy’ (in previews; opens on Tuesday) For anyone going through “The Office” withdrawal, the headline here is Jenna Fischer (a k a Pam) in her Off Broadway debut. For everyone else, the news is that Neil LaBute has created a sequel — the MCC Theater is calling it a companion piece — to his understated (by LaButian standards) 2008 gem “Reasons to Be Pretty.” All four of its characters are back for more high-octane couplings and uncouplings, with Ms. Fischer joined by Josh Hamilton, Leslie Bibb and the LaBute regular Fred Weller. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org . (Grode)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Roadkill’ (in previews; opens on June 16) St. Ann’s Warehouse has gained a reputation for immersive and sometimes challenging theater, but this off-site production may test the limits on both counts. In this piece conceived and directed by Cora Bissett, 25 audience members accompany a 13-year-old Nigerian girl and her “auntie” to what she the girl has been told will be her new home. The play’s title, and the fact that it has won an award from Amnesty International, may give you a sense of what awaits her. Departs from St. Ann’s Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org . (Grode) ‘The Silver Cord’ (in previews; opens on Tuesday) In case you missed this play the last time it was on Broadway — it was one of the 1926-27 season’s biggest hits — the Peccadillo Theater is reviving it Off Broadway. A domestic drama about a pathologically snug relationship between a woman and her two grown sons, this play offers a rare glimpse at the theater work of Sidney Howard, who is best known as a screenwriter (“Gone With the Wind,” “Dodsworth”) but he won a Pulitzer Prize for his play “They Knew What They Wanted.” Theater at St. Clement’s, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, thepeccadillo.com . (Grode) ‘Still More of Our Parts’ (opens on Thursday) The last time Theater Breaking Through Barriers presented an evening of short plays about life with disabilities, Anita Gates, in her review for The New York Times, called it “a largely entertaining and worthwhile mini-evening.” If consistency is any indication, we should expect more of the same during this year’s festival: nearly all of that evening’s playwrights are back for more, including Neil LaBute, Samuel D. Hunter (“The Whale”) and Bekah Brunstetter. And this time they brought a Tony Award winner, Tonya Pinkins (“Jelly’s Last Jam”). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, tbtb.org . (Grode) ‘Three Kinds of Exile’ (in previews; opens on Tuesday) John Guare’s new play has a dependably meaty subject — the lives of three noted émigrés from Poland and Czechoslovakia, among them the writer Witold Gombrowicz — and one unexpected co-star: Mr. Guare himself, who is making his Off Broadway acting debut 45 years after winning his first Obie Award for playwriting. Among his co-stars are the actors-turned-authors David Pittu and Martin Moran, so they’ll have plenty to talk about. Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, atlantictheater.org . (Grode) ‘The Two-Character Play’ (previews start on Monday; opens on June 19) Tennessee Williams’s titles may tend toward the florid, but this production goes the truth-in-advertising route. (The play was called “Out Cry” when it appeared on Broadway in 1973, only to go on a estate-mandated hiatus.) After a well-received London production in 2010, the play, directed by Gene David Kirk, comes to New York. The two characters — siblings forced to perform for an audience after being deserted by their acting troupe — are played by Brad Dourif and the frequent Williams interpreter Amanda Plummer. New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Grode) ‘The Unavoidable Disappearance of Tom Durnin’ (in previews; opens on June 27) David Morse, who has played everything including angels (“St. Elsewhere”) and devils (“How I Learned to Drive”), looks to split the difference in this new play by Steven Levenson (“The Language of Trees”). Here he stars as the title character, a white-collar criminal looking to reconnect with his family after his release from jail. But what if the family is managing just fine without him? Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org . (Grode) ‘Venice’ (in previews; opens on Thursday) Crumbling political structures in the not-too-distant future: The familiar tropes of dystopian fiction are given a fresh workout by Matt Sax and Eric Rosen, the young voices who scored a hit in 2008 with the hip-hop-flavored “Clay.” Here their musical palette expands to include more traditional rock, and they have assembled an impressive cast for this Public Lab staging, one that includes Jennifer Damiano and Leslie Odom Jr. as well as Mr. Sax himself. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org . (Grode) Broadway ‘Ann’ Holland Taylor wrote and stars in this solo show about Ann Richards, the straight-shooting onetime governor of Texas. Ms. Taylor’s engaging performance goes beyond impersonation, though the script is neither a dramatically shapely piece of writing nor a deeply probing character study (1:55). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org . (Charles Isherwood)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Annie’ James Lapine’s revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Anthony Warlow and Jane Lynch as Miss Hannigan (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com . (Ben Brantley) ★ ‘The Assembled Parties’ Richard Greenberg’s play about the decline of an affluent family is a throwback to a time when Charm — with a capital C — was a cardinal virtue in theater. It is also smart, sad and so impossibly well-spoken you may feel like giving up on conversation. Lynne Meadow directs a fine cast led by a singularly Charming Jessica Hecht (2:35). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Brantley) ★ ‘I’ll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers’ Bette Midler gives the most lusciously entertaining performance of the Broadway season in John Logan’s soufflé of a solo show in which she depicts the Hollywood agent Sue Mengers, dishing great piles of dirt as she awaits word from her great friend — and ex-client — Barbra Streisand (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Isherwood) ★ ‘Kinky Boots’ Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it’s hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Brantley) ‘Lucky Guy’ Nora Ephron’s elegy and valentine to the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters, starring Tom Hanks as the columnist Michael McAlary, is written with a true fan’s avidity. Directed with bells and whistles by George C. Wolfe, this is less a fully developed play than a boisterous swapping of fond anecdotes about the end of a life and the end of an era (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Brantley) ‘Macbeth’ Alan Cumming portrays the Scottish general who would be king, and all the other significant roles, in this one-man race through Shakespeare’s tragedy, set in a mental institution. Mr. Cumming’s virtuosity and the gothic inventions of the directors, John Tiffany and Andrew Goldberg, impress, but while the actor effectively differentiates the roles, he never fully inhabits any of them (1:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Isherwood) ★ ‘Matilda the Musical’ The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl’s novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children. Bertie Carvel is priceless as their schoolmistress nemesis (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Brantley) ‘Motown: The Musical’ A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy’s book is sketchy and obvious — you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com . (Isherwood)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘The Nance’ Playing a gay burlesque performer whose onstage specialty is mincing effeminacy, Nathan Lane combines shiny expertise and dark conviction to sometimes devastating effect, in this strained if heartfelt play by Douglas Carter Beane. Not even Mr. Lane, though, can reconcile all the disparities the script asks him to weave together. Jack O’Brien is the estimable director (2:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Brantley) ‘Pippin’ Diane Paulus sends in the acrobats for her exhaustingly energetic revival of Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson’s 1972 musical. As for the 99-pound story at the center of this muscle-bound spectacle — the one about the starry-eyed son of Charlemagne (Matthew James Thomas) — that’s there too, if you look hard. With Patina Miller and a delightful Andrea Martin (2:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Brantley) ‘Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella’ This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us “Oklahoma!,” has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Brantley) ‘The Trip to Bountiful’ Michael Wilson’s slow-handed staging of Horton Foote’s 1953 drama about an old woman’s journey into the past is most notable for its remarkable star, Cicely Tyson, who seems thoroughly rejuvenated by her return to Broadway. The attractive supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams, and in a lovely, low-key performance, Condola Rashad (2:10). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Brantley) ‘Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike’ Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang’s uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver also star in Nicholas Martin’s production, smoothly transferred from a sellout run Off Broadway (2:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Isherwood) Off Broadway ‘Basilica’ Mando Alvarado’s new drama sinks into predictable melodrama, but it’s still gripping in its portrayal of a family in crisis in San Juan, Tex. This is thanks in large part to the acting, especially that of Felix Solis as the mercurial Joe Garza (2:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org . (Claudia La Rocco) ‘The Caucasian Chalk Circle’ Christopher Lloyd brings acrid humor and physical exuberance to his roles as the narrator and the rascally rogue Azdak in Brian Kulick’s astute if uneven production of Brecht’s fable about a young woman who adopts an abandoned baby. The original music, by Duncan Sheik, is haunting and effective, and Elizabeth A. Davis (“Once”) sings with an appropriate soulfulness as the innocent Grusha (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org . (Isherwood) ‘Cougar the Musical’ Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of “Menopause: The Musical” and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Anita Gates)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ★ Ensemble Studio Theater 2013 Marathon (Series B) The six plays here make for another satisfying bill from Ensemble Studio Theater, which excels at the art of the one-act. One play in particular, “A Sunrise in Times Square” by Sharr White, stands out thanks to very fine performances by Julie Fitzpatrick and Joseph Lyle Taylor (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org . (Neil Genzlinger) ‘Far From Heaven’ Hinting at shimmering vistas beyond picket-fence conformity, Kelli O’Hara’s soprano provides the poetry in this generally prosy adaptation of Todd Haynes’s 2002 film about a beleaguered housewife in Eisenhower-era Hartford. Though Scott Frankel and Michael Korie have written some alluring songs, the show often seems to confine its wonderful star, and her character, to two dimensions (2:15). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com . (Brantley) ★ ‘Fried Chicken and Latkes’ Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor’s Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Andy Webster) ★ ‘_______ Up Everything’ The unprintable title of this winsome rock musical is trying way too hard to shock and awe. But then, so are all the show’s characters, who are Brooklyn faux-hemians desperately trying to prove their anti-establishment bona fides. Poking fun at the pasty-white underbelly of Brooklyn’s hipster crowd is like shooting free-range ducks in an artisanal barrel, but with catchy music and a talented cast, this show still does so exquisitely well (1:35). Elektra Theater, 669 Eighth Avenue, at 42nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, fueonstage.com . (Catherine Rampell) ‘Good Television’ Rod McLachlan explores the ghoulish world of reality television in this unsurprising but nicely done comedy-drama about a crew descending on the family of a South Carolina meth addict (the terrific John Magaro) in the hopes of digging up drama and good ratings (1:45). Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, atlantictheater.org . (Isherwood) ‘Gorilla’ Five underperforming businessmen are trapped in a series of team-building workshops, where they endure ridiculous exercises intended to generate trust, or intimacy, or whatever it is that these insipid hand-holding, blindfold-wearing, allegedly soul-bearing drills are supposed to instill. Some of the gags are funny, but most are tired and drawn out. The show’s attempt to offer more depth fails as well, partly because there are so many thinly developed story lines crammed into too little time (1:25). The Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Rampell) ★ ‘Here Lies Love’ An invigorating poperetta, conceived by David Byrne, that sets a new standard for audience participation. Or do I mean coercion? In this heady show about the heady life of Imelda Marcos, staged with infinite inventiveness by Alex Timbers, all the world’s a dance floor, and all the men and women (including the audience) merely disco rats (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org . (Brantley) ★ ‘Murder Ballad’ A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash’s contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman. Staged last fall at Manhattan Theater Club’s Studio at Stage II, the show returns with most of its original cast (John Ellison Conlee, Will Swenson and Rebecca Naomi Jones) and an addition: Caissie Levy, who has replaced Karen Olivo. Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com . (Brantley)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘My Name Is Asher Lev’ Aaron Posner’s adaptation of Chaim Potok’s novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place — the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

(Rachel Saltz) ★ ‘Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812’ Dave Malloy’s transporting pop opera dramatizes an emotionally potent slice of Tolstoy’s “War and Peace.” Rachel Chavkin directs a superb young cast who bring the loves and losses of 19th-century Russian aristocrats to vibrant, intimate life in a stylish cabaret setting expressly built for the production (2:30).

The real-life models for the characters here include George Balanchine (a perfect Michael Cerveris) and Igor Stravinsky (John Glover) (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Brantley) ★ ‘Peter and the Starcatcher’ The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company’s “Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.” This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Brantley) ★ ‘Potted Potter’ With no new Harry Potter adventures to pore over, what’s a Muggle in need of a fix to do? One answer: this gloriously goofy parody by Daniel Clarkson and Jefferson Turner, which compresses a retelling of the seven books into 70 minutes, complete with a game of Quidditch. Clearly the two comics attended Professor Flitwick’s charms class, because they cast the perfect spell over the audience: reductio ad absurdum (1:10). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Daniel M. Gold) ‘The Seagull’ The New York Classical Theater’s free outdoor production of Chekhov’s classic does a fine job of telling the story of its late-19th-century lovers, losers and dreamers at a Russian country estate. The translation can be simplistic at times, but the great lines are there and the settings (the audience moves en masse several times) couldn’t be more beautiful (1:40). Central Park, enter at 103rd Street at Central Park West, (212) 252-4531, newyorkclassical.org . (Gates) ‘Somewhere Fun’ Kathleen Chalfant and Kate Mulgrew, as two upper crusty old friends whose chance meeting on a Manhattan street incites a collage of strange encounters, lead an excellent cast in Jenny Schwartz’s intermittently diverting, blatantly word-drunk but deeply frustrating new play. The virtuosic language often delights, but underneath is an emotional void (2:15). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org .

(Ken Jaworowski) ★ ‘The Weir’ This first-rate revival of Conor McPherson’s play gathers a group of friends as they tell ghost stories to drive away a loneliness than can be even more frightening (1:30).

(Jaworowski)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Off Off Broadway ★ ‘Patti Issues’ In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men’s propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com . (David Rooney) ‘Showgirls! The Musical!’ If ever a movie were ripe for a sendup, it’s Paul Verhoeven’s 1995 turkey, “Showgirls.” The lurid story of a hitchhiker turned pole dancer turned Las Vegas star is catnip for any devotee of camp, and this frenetic production pushes it into the camp stratosphere, with X-rated songs, abundant toplessness and a much higher male quotient. Alas, the movie’s misogyny lingers. The tireless and fearless April Kidwell, in the Elizabeth Berkley role, is a wonder: Her vibrant physicality and knowing humor inadvertently constitute a welcome riposte to the story’s mockery of its protagonist (1:30). (Wednesdays and Saturdays only.) XL Nightclub, 512 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-2999, showgirlsthemusical.com . (Webster) ★ ‘Then She Fell’ Inspired by Lewis Carroll’s “Alice” books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended. A guided tour of Wonderland, created by Third Rail Projects, leads its participants through a series of rooms and an interactive evening of dance, poetry, food and drink (2:00).

(Brantley) ‘Totally Tubular Time Machine’ This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an ’80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com .

An excellent cast, expert design and pacey direction by Ed Sylvanus Iskandar cannot make up for the play’s slender substance (1:15).

(Isherwood)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘I’m a Stranger Here Myself’ (closes on Sunday) The cabaret singer Mark Nadler does an effective job of transforming what last year was a cabaret show into a theatrical production, annotating a journey through music that was created during the Weimar Republic or by composers like Kurt Weill after they escaped Naziism. The show starts out feeling like a pleasant history lesson but ends as a profoundly personal journey (1:45).

(Genzlinger) ‘The Last Cyclist’ (closes on Sunday) An intriguing exercise in Holocaust history, “The Last Cyclist” is an effort to recreate a satirical play that was being readied for performance in 1944 by prisoners at Theresienstadt, the Nazi concentration camp near Prague. The story involves inmates in a mental institution who take over a society and randomly decree that bicyclists should be killed or deported. The Jewish Council of Elders that governed the camp squelched the production after the dress rehearsal. It’s not much of a play, but here in 2013 it is a testament to human determination to defy oppression (1:45) West End Theater at the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, 263 West 86th Street, (866) 811-4111, thelastcyclist.com . (Genzlinger) ‘Marcellus Shale’ (closes on Sunday) Paul Zimet’s play with music is about the effects on a New York town of fracking (hydraulic fracturing), where the gas companies’ generous checks don’t make up for the health and environmental devastation. The songs sound like half-rewritten hymns and the actors seem to equate loud with heartfelt, but there are some inventive touches (1:30). La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org . (Gates) ‘The Master Builder’ (closes on Sunday) John Turturro plays Halvard Solness, the tortured, torturing architect in Andrei Belgrader’s studied but arid production of Ibsen’s enigmatic drama about the spiritual cost of success and the mysterious forces that shape human destinies (2:10).

(Isherwood) ★ ‘Old Hats’ (closes on Sunday) Bill Irwin and David Shiner, the peerless neo-vaudevillian jesters behind the long-running hit “Fool Moon,” have concocted a winning new compendium of nifty clown routines.

(Isherwood) ‘A Public Reading of an Unproduced Screenplay About the Death of Walt Disney’ (closes on Sunday) Larry Pine gives a mesmerizing performance as the title character in Lucas Hnath’s dark comic inversion of the Disney legend.
