We can offer only a few certainties. First, stop looking for Uncle Mo on the betting board. He’s out , KO’ed by a stomach infection. (Excessive horse stress? Bad carrots? Mystery abounds.) Feel queasy about picking Archarcharch. He drew the rail . Hate the rail. Consider making your choice with the aid of a blindfold, darts, or both, because it’s hard to apply wisdom to a field this unproven . Yes, the Derby does have the feeling of the royal wedding: one glamorous day amid an otherwise fading institution. But even if horse racing trails even the monarchy in the bleak future department, the Derby does still matter, writes John Clay of The Lexington Herald-Leader , because we’re a nation that loves big events. So go ahead and bone up on the story lines, like those detailed here on Yahoo.com , and ponder why The Washington Post’s Andrew Beyer is talking up Shackleford, why The Louisville Courier-Journal’s Rick Bozich writes to watch out for Calvin Borel on a 20-1 shot, why Nick Zito is high on Dialed In , and why Mucho Macho Man’s owner, Dean Reeves, feels like the happiest guy in the world . Sure, safety concerns still dog this race and the sport in general, but people will still watch in droves as the chaotic first two seconds — as described by Reed Albergotti on WSJ.com — determines the fate of the 19 contestants. The fabled stretch? Way overrated.

Most people, like SI.com’s Chris Mannix , give Mosley about the same odds as Uncle Mo (that would be zero), but Mosley refuses to give in to the doubts about his age and decline in skill, writes Kevin Iole on Yahoo.com .

Philadelphia, down by 3-0 to Boston, and Detroit, down by 3-0 to San Jose, will be trying to stave off sweeps Friday night. Vancouver’s victory Thursday night, in which Ryan Kesler bent another game against Nashville to his will, writes Cam Cole in The Vancouver Sun , sent the last potentially interesting second-round series to a likely uneventful conclusion, writes Adrian Dater on SI.com . At least the Canucks bring us the Green Men, who spent Thursday night entertaining Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban .

His henchman Steve Soboroff spent the day whining aloud that the league was unfairly squeezing McCourt and that he had been unable to reach the team’s new trustee when he wanted to boost security in the wake of the Osama Bin Laden killing. Everyone was too polite to tell Soboroff that even the terrorists might be afraid to go to the Dodger Stadium parking lots. Scott Miller writes on CBSSports.com that McCourt has no backing among the other baseball owners, who, like Ray Ratto of CBSSports.com , wish he would just go away. There were far more charitable thoughts aimed at Maryland Coach Gary Williams as he announced his retirement as one of college basketball’s most colorful figures, known for a red face and blue vocabulary that might turn an unsuspecting bystander’s face purple. But Williams retired just the way he coached, his way, writes Dana O’Neil on ESPN.com . Seth Davis writes an appreciation on SI.com and John Feinstein writes in The Washington Post that he doubts Williams will do much relaxing in retirement. College basketball lost something else Thursday: the one-of-a-kind voice of Gus Johnson from its N.C.A.A. tournament broadcasts on CBS. But at least NFL Network viewers gained some good news with the ouster of Matt Millen and Joe Theismann from the Thursday night game broadcasts. All that considered, you may now return to your Derby prognosticating. Beware of others doing so with darts and blindfolds.
