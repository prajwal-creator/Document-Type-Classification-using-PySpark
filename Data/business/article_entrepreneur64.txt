The Warner box  — all reissues of previously available material  — brings together 24 Bogart films on 12 discs and throws in the 2008 documentary “The Brothers Warner” and a 48-page tribute book for an eminently reasonable suggested retail price of $99.98. For Blu-ray fans, two of the definitive Bogie films, “The Maltese Falcon”  (1941) and “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre”  (1948), both directed by Bogart’s close friend John Huston, have now been upgraded to Blu-ray and are available separately at $24.98 each, and both look magnificent in beautifully graded black and white. Bogart appeared in some 80 films, which ranged from the 1928 short “The Dancing Town,” shot at Paramount’s Astoria studios while he was still appearing on Broadway, to his final role, as a sports publicist who belatedly discovers his conscience, in Mark Robson’s “Harder They Fall” (1956). He died of throat cancer a few months after the picture was released. But only a handful of those films feature the Bogart of myth: in addition to “Falcon” and “Treasure,” one might count “High Sierra” (1941), “Casablanca” (1943), “To Have and Have Not” (1944), “The Big Sleep” (1946), maybe “Dark Passage” (1947) and probably “Key Largo” (1948). All are included in this set, but so are movies like “Marked Woman” (1937), “Dark Victory” (1939) and “Virginia City” (1940), in which Bogart plays generic supporting roles, and other films, like “All Through the Night” (1942) and “Action in the North Atlantic” (1943), in which Bogart plays leading parts that draw little, if at all, on the deeper qualities that made him a star. He was not only a late bloomer, but also an intermittent one.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Bogart was hardly alone in taking his time to find his screen personality. It took John Wayne some 10 years of hard work and experimentation, much of it in B westerns, to find the gait and rhythm that would make him a towering presence on screen. And it is fascinating to watch Cary Grant’s slow but steady progress as he moves from the brilliantined clotheshorse of “Devil and the Deep” (1932) to the fully developed personality of “The Awful Truth” (1937).

Entertainment    But where Wayne advances through dedication and Grant seems to relax gradually into his personality, Bogart’s development seems fitful and erratic. A Manhattan child of privilege (his father was a doctor, his mother a successful commercial artist), Bogart shared little life experience with his most famous characters. As a young actor on Broadway he specialized in cheerful go-getters and Park Avenue types. Some sense of his early manner can be gleaned from “The Bad Sister,” a 1931 Universal feature (coincidentally Bette Davis’s first film) in which he plays a society swindler. His accent is more George Plimpton than James Cagney, and his voice seems pitched a register above his later signature growl.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       In the early ’30s Bogart shuttled between Broadway and Hollywood, playing supporting roles in a few films (and making the acquaintance of the director Raoul Walsh, who employed him as a voice coach for the endangered silent star Charles Farrell on the 1931 “Man Who Came Back” ), but never getting a real foothold in the business. That started to happen back in New York, when he played a gangster in the independent feature “Midnight” — not much of a role in not much of a movie, but one that pointed the way toward his breakthrough part, that of the gangster Duke Mantee in Robert E. Sherwood’s play “The Petrified Forest.” When Warner Brothers acquired the film rights, the play’s star and co-producer, Leslie Howard, insisted Bogart come along with it. “The Petrified Forest” is the first film in the new Warner set, and it sets the tone for much of what follows: the battered looks, the insolent demeanor and the simmering anger that had held him back as a leading man suddenly work in his favor, and for the first time in a movie he seems to know who he is.  But his studio, manifestly, did not. Uncertain of Bogart’s appeal, the studio cast him in character parts, generally malevolent (his resemblance to John Dillinger did not pass unnoticed) in  A pictures like “Kid Galahad” and “The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse” (Bogart’s first collaboration with John Huston, who worked on the script). But in B pictures he was a leading man, frequently in scripts that had served as A pictures just a few years before: “Two Against the World” (a remake of “Five Star Final” ), “Isle of Fury,”  “King of the Underworld.” The Warner set might have benefited from a few more of these and a few less of his A picture walk-ons (though it does include the A-/B+ “Black Legion,” in which Bogart is a factory worker seduced by a fanatical anti-immigrant group). Bogart finally broke out of this pattern (as his near contemporary Ronald Reagan never really did) with “High Sierra” in 1941. Though still billed second  (after another suddenly successful, late-blooming star: Ida Lupino), Bogart owned the movie as Roy Earle, an aging gangster clearly based on Dillinger who is drafted to take part in the ill-conceived robbery of a resort hotel. Directed by Walsh (who had since worked with Bogart on “The Roaring Twenties” and “They Drive by Night” ) and co-written by John Huston, the film drew on aspects of Bogart’s talent that no movie had before; suddenly his performance has an interiority — a sense of secret thoughts, hidden motivations, buried feelings  — unknown to the stock figures he had played so often before. His temples grayed to make him look 10 years older, Bogart burrowed into the role to find a sense of alienation and regret. He seems to move more slowly than any of the other actors (in particular contrast to the hyperkinetic Lupino), and his black suit settles on him like a monk’s robe, separating him visually as well as emotionally from his sunny California surroundings.

He learns the hard way, during the course of the film, that he will never belong to a family circle or a wider community (he is used, then tossed over, by Joan Leslie’s fresh-faced farm girl, who only wants him to pay for her orthopedic operation), and his stoic acceptance makes him a new kind of hero. He’s neither the eager entrepreneur of the 1920s nor the popular-front communalist of the early Depression, but a self-defined outsider whose like would not be seen again until the Beat Generation of the 1950s.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   As Bogart aged, he lost his defiance, leaving Warner Brothers for Columbia and trading his gat for a bow tie. In movies like “The African Queen” and “We’re No Angels” he practically begged the audience to love him; in films like “Deadline  — U.S.A.” and “The Left Hand of God” he seemed too eager to save society by sacrificing himself. But there was one last, unforgettable blast of Bogie in Nicholas Ray’s “In a Lonely Place” (1950),  a movie true to its title and brimming with sad self-awareness. It’s the story of a man lost in Hollywood.

Although the film was released theatrically in 3-D, this is the 2-D version. With the voices of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler and America Ferrera. “The way the dragons look, the way they move, the way they catch the light, dissolve in the mist, somersault through the air and dive toward the ground — all of this is likely to make you forget the uninspired plot and the shopworn lessons, even as you are reminded of some of the basic, ecstatic reasons you go to the movies in the first place,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times in March.
