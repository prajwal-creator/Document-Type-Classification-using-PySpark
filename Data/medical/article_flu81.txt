Health officials were also investigating why there was a high incidence of cocaine users among those infected with hepatitis. Four new cases of hepatitis A, a nonfatal virus, were diagnosed Friday, bringing the county's total since May to 54 cases. Last year, there were eight cases in the county. Of particular concern to health officials were six cases involving employees of five restaurants within the last month. As a result, employees of Onondaga's 1,700 eating establishments were ordered Wednesday to wear disposable plastic gloves when preparing and serving food.

''That includes employees of restaurants, hot-dog stands, temporary food stands and even ice cream stands.''

Such contamination can occur if a restaurant employee fails to wash his hands after going to the bathroom. The plastic-glove directive will remain in effect until the outbreak subsides, a period Dr. Miller estimated at two months. The measure has the support of the State Health Department because of an alarming pattern of outbreaks of hepatitis A in three upstate New York communities since January. The department is urging all the counties in the state to watch for hepatitis. It is also warning them that some of the hepatitis A has been linked to the intravenous use of cocaine. ''This is disturbing,'' said Stanley Kondracki, an epidemiologist with the State Health Department's Bureau of Infectious Diseases who has been studying the cases. ''And yet, it fascinates us. Several of the diagnosed cases have had intravenous cocaine abuse in their histories.''

Of 63 people diagnosed with hepatitis A in January and February, 23 admitted to cocaine use, Mr. Kondracki said. In April, an outbreak in Cortland County, south of Onondaga County, included 25 confirmed cases, of which half involved admitted cocaine users, Mr. Kondracki said. In Onondaga County, as well, roughly half of the 54 cases have been linked to cocaine use. A similar phenomenon has been noticed in other parts of the country, according to Dr. Mark Kane, an epidemiologist with the hepatitis branch of the Centers for Disease Control. ''Whether it is associated with contaminated lots of drugs or with the life styles of drug users - lots of people living together in low-income housing, we don't know yet,'' Dr. Kane said.

Flu-Like Symptoms Most people initially experience flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, fever, nausea and body aches. Later symptoms include jaundice and severe abdominal and stomach pains that last several weeks but cause no permanent damage, Dr. Kane said. The outbreak continues to spread because it can be transmitted in its early stages during which a victim may not realize the symptoms as being those of hepatitis A. The Onondaga County Health Department has offered a series of free clinics to inoculate residents who may have been exposed. Since June 13, the county has inoculated 10,000 people at a cost of $4 per shot, said Dr. Miller, the Health Commissioner. Health officials also hope the requirement that restaurant workers wear plastic gloves will help curtail the outbreak. But some restaurant owners said they hoped the gloves work. ''It gives the public the image that we are doing something,'' said Terry Riley, owner of Riley's restaurant in Syracuse. ''But it might not really be any better than having employees who wash their hands really well.''    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
