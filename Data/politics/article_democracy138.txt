The setting did not exactly support his point, since he was standing in a mock courtroom on a popular daytime show called “Fashion Verdict,” which prosecutes badly dressed women for dressing badly. Mr. Urgant accused a socialite of vulgar excess and didn’t smirk, even though he was testifying in a tribunal decorated in the style of a Bratz doll dream house. “Fashion Verdict” has a dizzying format — part makeover show, part show trial — but like a lot of Russian television it’s a whimsical, over-the-top adaptation that somehow suits the national spirit. A Russian crime procedural has a bribe-taking hero; a coming-of-age sitcom is set in the last days of the Soviet empire; middle-aged busybodies bully the bachelor on a dating show; and contestants on Russian “Jeopardy” dress in shiny wizard robes. To anyone who remembers television when the Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin first came to power — a dispirited consignment shop of Mexican soap operas and insipid copies of programs from the West — the sheer variety and brio of Russian programming says something about his long, complicated reign. Television over the last 10 years has mirrored the country’s economic recovery. State-controlled news deliberately spread Mr. Putin’s message of stability and prosperity at any cost. Entertainment subliminally echoed it.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Yet change is in the air. Protest and opposition to Mr. Putin, the prime minister, is sneaking onto the news. And with elections coming on March 4, Mr. Putin’s quest for something like a presidency for life looks more like banana republicanism than the stirring clamor of democracy. Suddenly Mr. Putin’s relationship with television is like a marriage that seems fine until minor differences look irreconcilable. Television is Mr. Putin’s medium, and he takes his macho stunts seriously. Whether it’s hunting for tigers or scolding lazy bureaucrats in staged meetings, Mr. Putin does it all with a straight face. (His critics joke that he has no choice; his mock Twitter hashtag is “botox.”) That kind of grandiosity grates in a TV universe that is playful and self-aware. “Let’s Get Married!” is a dating show like “The Bachelor,” but without the time — or budget — for sunset balloon rides across Moldovan wine country or hot-tub getaways on the Black Sea. Instead, it brings a jolt of Slavic fatalism to romance: the bachelor has his choice of three eligible and comely young women, but first he must listen to the advice and commentary of a panel of older women who cross-examine him and the potential brides. Also, for no better reason than a flair for excess, the bachelor and his prospective brides sometimes wear theme costumes: he as a hussar officer and they as Tolstoyian ballroom belles, he as Aladdin and they as a harem of belly dancers.

Here, the contestants prepare to perform a belly dance for their bachelor-prince, dressed as Aladdin.

But the cheeky, knowing tone assumes that viewers can enjoy nosy Russian yentas — and laugh at themselves. There’s plenty of humor on Russian television, though not much political satire; Mr. Putin put a stop to that long ago. To fill the gap there is loads of bathos and bad taste. Treacly, sequin-studded variety specials featuring disco balls and smoke machines pay tribute to stars of yesteryear who for some reason are still around.

One of the most popular procedurals of all time is “Glukhar,” which finished its last season a the end of 2011. It is about a police inspector, Sergei Glukharyov, who is a loyal son, hard worker and talented detective who occasionally, just once in a while, accepts bribes. There are shows aimed at younger audiences that are variations on the “Big Brother” genre. “House 2,” which puts a household of sexy, quarrelsome young people under reality-show house arrest, is in its 10th season. One of the original hosts of “House 2,” Kseniya Sobchak, is the socialite daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, an early reformer and Putin ally, who died in 2000. Ms. Sobchak, who is blond, bubbly and often likened to Paris Hilton , was a defendant in 2009 on “Fashion Verdict,” on which she was accused of dressing provocatively and too expensively. (The evidence, a montage of Ms. Sobchak wearing lots of jewelry and not much clothing, was overwhelming.) Ms. Sobchak, who now sports a sober mien and black-framed glasses, has almost overnight become the “It” girl of the Twitter protest movement. This month she began hosting a weekly talk show on Russian MTV : Mr. Putin was her first topic. Her tweets and appearances at anti-Putin rallies get attention, mostly because of the unusually close historical ties between her family and the prime minister but also because she is famous for being famous.

They make up Mr. Putin’s political base, and his campaign courts them with class warfare, using state-controlled news programs to paint anti-Putin activists as privileged urban elites out of touch with real Russians. But that hasn’t prevented evidence of Mr. Putin’s newly shaky standing from finding its way onto TV screens. Some of the celebrities whom viewers know best have turned against Mr. Putin. Ms. Sobchak is one, but her following is a young niche audience. Alla Pugacheva, on the other hand, is the country’s most enduring pop diva, Barbra Streisand with a little bit of Cher and lots of Elizabeth Taylor , and she is supporting one of Mr. Putin’s opponents for president, the billionaire businessman Mikhail D. Prokhorov .  Photo        Kseniya Sobchak, a socialite, TV host and critic of Vladimir V. Putin.

It doesn’t criticize the government, but it exposes social problems that are rarely discussed aloud, giving voice, for example, to people with severe handicaps who tend to be shunted off to institutions where they are conveniently invisible. The Russian judicial legal system doesn’t have a savory reputation — critics and journalists are beaten and sometimes killed, and the perpetrators too often go free. Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky , the Russian billionaire who turned on Mr. Putin, sits in a prison camp.

Plaintiffs and defendants overact, but unlike Judge Judy or Judge Joe Brown, Russian TV judges aren’t show-offs, and they don’t kid around. Their sobriety suggests that the audience has an expectation of fair play, or at least a yearning for real justice. And, of course, prizes. Most Russian game shows copy European and American formats, then embellish. “It’s a Game” is a quiz show modeled on “Jeopardy,” but the contestants wear silvery wizard smocks and the host, Pyotr Kuleshov, is far more severe than Alex Trebek. He was indignant when one recent contestant couldn’t name Tchaikovsky’s French choreographer. “It’s Petipa, of course,” he snapped. There are less demanding game shows with bigger payoffs, like “Ten Million.” On that show not long ago a man and wife, middle aged, plump and good natured, were baffled when asked why the French celebrate on July 14. The boyish host, Maksim Galkin, who happens to be the latest, much younger, husband of the pop diva Ms. Pugacheva, tried to steer the nice couple to the storming of the Bastille and the start of the French Revolution. “Everybody used to know it,” he pleaded. “It was a big deal in Soviet times.” They shook their heads, stumped. The Soviet past seems very distant on all these shows, yet it’s never out of the picture for long. The British have “Downton Abbey,” and the Russians have Communism: at any given time there is at least one period drama that is set in Stalin’s terror, the Khrushchev space race or Brezhnev era stagnation. Audiences just watched the finale of “Zhukov,” an expensive but rather turgid mini-series about Marshal Georgy Zhukov, the Red Army hero of World War II . “Grocery Store No. 1,” which was broadcast on a privately owned network, was much better: an engrossing, beautifully shot drama based on the real-life case of Yuri Sokolov, the manager of Moscow’s fanciest food emporium, who was convicted of corruption and executed by the Communist regime in 1984. Time blurs memory, and nowadays history isn’t always shown as tragic. The jokes on a new Russian sitcom called “The Eighties,” are punctuated with faded archival footage; Moscow without neon or traffic and Russians lining up around the block to buy sausage. It’s a coming-of-age comedy like “That ’70s Show” or “Happy Days” but focused on the naïveté and insularity of Soviet society in a way that makes viewers feel sophisticated and modern. A nerdy university student tries to impress a pretty girl who just moved back from France . “When I was a kid, I went abroad too,” he boasts. “ Mongolia .”   There are two targeted audiences: older Russians who are nostalgic for their pre-perestroika youth and younger viewers who are curious about a Communist system that today seems unimaginable. “The Eighties” takes a wistful, affectionate look back at the early days of Mikhail Gorbachev , when change was in the air but not yet on the streets. It’s a flashback that is oddly timely: it summons an era when many Russians first began hoping that they would someday live in a normal country.
