The turnout is worth noting: it dwarfs the average attendance at last year’s world championships in Osaka, Japan. The 50,000 people are here because Liu Xiang , China’s most celebrated athlete and its first and only male track-and-field gold medalist, is on the card tonight. He materializes on the stadium’s huge digital screens at 9:35 p.m., and the crowd roars. His narrow, handsome face is instantly recognizable — it adorns airport terminals, train stations and highway billboards and sells Coca-Cola, Nike shoes and Lenovo laptops. Liu himself rarely appears in public, but there he is, dressed in the shimmering yellow and red singlet of the Chinese national team. Cameras flicker like fireflies. He rolls his neck and stares up at the masses. He is 6-foot-2, 180 pounds, and runs the 110-meter hurdles. His greatest hits flash across the screens: his 2006 world record of 12.88 seconds; his dominating victory at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. No real drama is expected. Liu is racing against other Asian hurdlers, mostly Chinese, whom he has thrashed for years. In August, he’ll run on this same track in the Olympics and the pressure will be very different.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The hurdlers drop into position as the announcer asks for quiet. Screams erupt at the crack of the starter’s gun, and just as quickly dissolve into gasps of disbelief: Liu jumped early. Another false start means disqualification. A nervous murmur ripples through the stadium. Could he actually lose? Like everyone else, I came to watch him perform on his big stage, if not yet at his big moment. One false start has brought the obvious revelation: there are no meaningless track meets for Liu Xiang.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Liu waggles his arms and bounces lightly on his toes, like a boxer before the bell. The hurdlers crouch down again and wait for the pistol. Liu’s legs slice over the hurdles as crisply as scissors, and his victory comes so easily that he seems to slow at the finish. The race takes just 13.18 seconds. Fifty thousand people, sated, begin to leave, oblivious to the fact that other events are still underway. They got what they came for. They have no idea that Liu will soon lose his world record, lose his rhythm and lose his front-runner status. One thing he will not lose is the pressure. He is still expected to fulfill the expectations of one-fifth of humanity. In the United States, people might ask: Liu who? His name only occasionally flitters across the pages of sports sections. But in China, he is often considered more popular than even Yao Ming, the basketball superstar whose N.B.A. success is a point of immense national pride. A recent poll asked people their wishes for the Beijing Games. Staging a successful Olympics ranked fourth; watching Liu Xiang win gold ranked first. “He’s huge,” says P. T. Black, a partner at Jigsaw International, a market-research firm in Shanghai. “He is so far and away the No. 1 sports celebrity in the country. What he has done is something people here in China didn’t know they could do.” What Liu proved was something many Chinese still cannot quite believe: that they can compete with anyone in sports that demand speed and power. Many Chinese assumed they were genetically disadvantaged in such sports; Liu showed them that China was a nation of more than just Ping-Pong players. Hurdling has no real tradition in China, and few Chinese follow the sport for its aesthetic values or understand the excruciatingly narrow margin between winning and losing. But in Athens, they watched Liu demolish the world’s best hurdlers and tie what was then a world record of 12.91 seconds. Overjoyed and triumphant, he draped a Chinese flag over his shoulders for a victory lap. At a news conference, Liu admitted out loud what his countrymen were thinking.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   “It is kind of a miracle,” he said. “It is unbelievable — a Chinese, an Asian, has won this event. It is a proud moment not only for China but for Asia and all people who share the same yellow skin color.” He then made a pronouncement: “Please pay attention to Chinese track and field. I think we Chinese can unleash a yellow tornado on the world.” Yao carried the Chinese flag during the opening ceremony in Athens, but it went to Liu for the closing. Flying back to Beijing with the Chinese team, Yao handed him another baton. “Yao Ming said, ‘Finally, you can understand the pressure on me,’ ” Liu recalled. At 25, Liu’s appealing blend of humility and swagger has made him a sensation in China, not to mention rich. His love of country is real, but anyone who has watched him compete can see that he is not merely performing for the glory of the Communist Party. When he set the world record of 12.88 seconds at a 2006 meet in Lausanne, Switzerland, he jumped atop the digital clock and happily posed for photos, smiling, punching the air and kicking his legs. His success and good looks have made him a breakthrough athlete in China’s emerging world of sports marketing, and he has become an idol for a new, more individualistic generation in China. Young men want to be him; young women want to marry him. Endorsements pushed Liu’s 2007 earnings to more than $23 million, according to a survey by Forbes. His sponsors are already competing for his time once his race is over in Beijing. Parties are planned. Ad campaigns are waiting to be unveiled. All it will take is victory. “He represents national pride,” says Jimmy Qin, sports marketing director for Coca-Cola in China. “We want to celebrate that.” Liu’s rock-star status makes him an anomaly in the Chinese sports system. Olympic glory is rarely individual glory in China. In the seven years since Beijing was awarded the Games, the ruling Communist Party has spent billions so that the official state sports program, overseen by the General Administration of Sport, can produce more athletes and win more medals, especially gold, than ever before. China is no different than the United States and Russia in placing so much national prestige on winning medals, but the difference is that China has focused its entire sports apparatus on Olympic gold. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, China finished third in gold medals with 28, its most ever. But within this success, officials also saw a telling disparity: 21 of those medals came in table tennis, diving, badminton, weight lifting and gymnastics. China struggled in other sports, especially in swimming; other water sports like rowing; and track and field. At the time, these events offered 119 potential gold medals, yet China won only 1 in Sydney. Thus was born Project 119: a government program that has poured money into these sports in pursuit of a larger share of those medals (the total is now 122). New training centers were built. Foreign coaches were hired for water polo, synchronized swimming, canoeing and rowing, as well as for other events like field hockey, fencing, basketball and cycling. The program bore fruit in Athens, where China won 32 gold medals, second only to the United States. But the real focus has been 2008. The Communist Party not only wants to capture the most gold medals in Beijing but also show the outside world a rising, modern China. That public relations agenda has taken a hit in a year that has seen Tibetan riots, epic floods, angry protests at the Olympic torch relay and a catastrophic earthquake. But when the Games open on August 8, Beijing still hopes the same basic message will resonate: Look at what three decades of economic reforms have done! Look at this new China, led by the Communist Party! The dazzling Olympic venues are eye candy in this pitch and make it easy to forget that the sports machine is one of the least reformed institutions in China. Coaches begin identifying prospects during regular visits to local elementary schools. Consider that in just one city — Suqian, in Jiangsu Province — every government district was asked to assess children from the ages of 8 to 13 and select candidates for sports schools. In turn, the teenagers who prove good enough then matriculate to bigger government training academies. Their sports are often chosen for them through systematic examination of their physique and an eye toward what’s most likely to produce Olympic medals, especially gold. They are employees of the state who train long hours, are paid little and are often discarded if they fail to reach elite status.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   As much as Liu Xiang appears to transcend the system, it created him and it still controls him. I was on a train earlier this year, returning to Beijing from central China. It was the overnight local, loaded with migrant workers returning to the city after their annual visit home for the Lunar New Year. These were the people building the Olympic city. When we finally stepped onto the platform and into the bleary morning light of the Beijing West station, there was Liu, his smiling image selling us yogurt from an overhead advertisement. At the time, as I stood surrounded by workers for whom the Olympics would bring some pride but little reward, he seemed as incongruous as some unidentified flying object from another world. But as the Games approached, I began to realize that Liu’s world was not so disconnected from the people on my train. Like them, he had a job to do for the Olympics. He, too, was a cog in the machine.  Photo        MAN OF THE (1.3 BILLION) PEOPLE: A billboard featuring Liu Xiang in a Beijing subway station. His success and charisma have made him an idol for a more individualistic generation in China.   Credit Feng Li/Getty Images    Two days after his win The National Stadium, I met with Liu at a media event titled “A Day in the Life With Olympic champion Liu Xiang.” I was among a small group of journalists invited to observe him inside the Training Bureau of the General Administration of Sport. We had low expectations for an “Oprah” moment, but Liu rarely speaks to the foreign press, so we felt fortunate to get any access at all. We watched him do situps, curl dumbbells and do some light running during a workout with other Chinese hurdlers at a dingy indoor track. He played table tennis, shot pool and bowled with teammates. This qualified as the “leisure time” segment of his day and proved that watching hurdlers bowl is certainly less entertaining than watching bowlers hurdle. Liu is the undisputed centerpiece of China’s entire Olympic team. Yet the uninformed observer watching him work out might not guess at his status. He showed no outward signs of being a diva; he did the same drills as everyone else. His teammate Shi Dongpeng, who finished fifth at the World Championships, is taller and seemingly more impressive physically. But Shi is considered only a borderline medal threat. Project 119 has made China more competitive but not so much that traditional track powers like the United States are feeling overly threatened. In Beijing, China will field more than 70 athletes for track-and-field events, compared with 52 in Athens. But Chinese coaches feel they have a good chance for medals in only a handful of events: the women’s hammer throw, the women’s marathon, race walking and possibly one of the women’s relays. The winds blowing the yellow tornado still mostly come from Liu. After his workout, Liu walked over and sat down. An interpreter sat beside him. Liu is studying English and understands enough to chat with his rivals, if not enough for a full-blown media day. The subject of pressure came up immediately. “Four years ago, I was not so popular,” he said. “People didn’t recognize me when I was on the street. Now everyone recognizes me, so I can’t be on the street. Being famous is sometimes a good thing, but sometimes not very good.” Given a choice, he said, he would prefer “to be ordinary and not so famous.” He usually trains in his hometown, Shanghai, the country’s financial capital. But earlier this year he joined the hurdling team in Beijing to prepare for the Games. Liu is exempted from having to run qualifying times to ensure his place on the team. His preparations are deemed more important. He is tended by a special team of coaches, doctors and gofers. They train him, feed him, supervise him and drive him around. In Beijing, he shares a two-bedroom apartment in an athletic dormitory with his hurdling coach, Sun Haiping. Liu was friendly, a bit shy, but accustomed to questioners. He confessed that the concept of a girlfriend interests him but that he has never had time for one. “I hope after the Olympics,” he said, smiling, not needing to mention that he is the most eligible bachelor in China. (His father keeps signed photographs to hand out as gifts to the young women who travel from all over China to the family’s Shanghai apartment.)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   When in Shanghai, Liu’s life is far different from the glamorous one portrayed in his billboard ads and television commercials. Government sports officials negotiate his endorsements and, according to his father, take half the earnings. His parents oversee Liu’s half of the pot, and if he indulges himself, he does so inconspicuously. He bought an apartment in his old Shanghai neighborhood, but renovations are still underway. His family lives in a suburban apartment provided by the government as a reward for his Athens gold medal. Liu lives with them on weekends and spends his weekdays inside Shanghai’s top sports training center. On weekends, his coach is not far away; he owns an apartment in the same complex. They can literally see each other through their windows. “I go home, and I go to the training facility,” Liu said, describing his routine. “Two places. And those two places are the safest for me.” In China, he is almost always accompanied by coaches or officials. Though he endorses Cadillac, he cannot drive — he has not been permitted to get a license. His isolation is a product of the sports system but also a symptom of his celebrity. In Shanghai, at least five daily newspapers and one television station have assigned reporters to cover him. He likes eating Japanese food and shopping, at least when he is abroad. He has a taste for designer clothes. “He is always very happy to travel abroad,” says Feng Shuyong, the amiable head coach of China’s track team. “There are fewer people who know him. He can go shopping. He likes shopping.” He loves to sing karaoke. (“I know all the Chinese songs,” he told us.) But when he goes out, his coaches sneak him into a club and later shuttle him out a back door. He keeps in touch with friends by e-mail or text message. “He wants to be normal,” Feng says. “Sometimes, I think: He is a young man. He wants to do many things, but he cannot. I feel sorry for him. Many times he is alone in his room, chatting on the Internet with friends. “But at the same time,” Feng adds, “I appreciate that he has targeted the Olympic Games. For this target, he has sacrificed so many things.” Our day in Liu Xiang’s life ended with one telling observation: he was favoring his right hamstring. The next day he flew to New York for the Reebok Grand Prix, posing for photographs atop the Empire State Building , but he dropped out of the meet, citing the injury. He then traveled to Eugene, Ore., to run in the Prefontaine Classic, the biggest track meet in the United States and an event sponsored by Nike. He said the hamstring was fine. But he was disqualified on a false start. Then, on June 12, Dayron Robles exploded out of the blocks at the Golden Spike competition in the Czech Republic. Robles, a Cuban, is considered the most physically gifted hurdler alive, exactly the type of athlete amplified in the Chinese imagination. He ripped over the hurdles in a shocking 12.87 seconds. Liu’s world record was history. Robles was still breathing heavily, exultant, when a television reporter pressed forward with a question: Can you beat Liu Xiang in the Olympics? “We will see,” was Robles’s answer.

But only 57 days remained until the Olympics, and Liu Xiang was suddenly an underdog. Twelve men have run the 110-meter hurdles in less than 13 seconds. Only two, Liu and Robles, have dipped below 12.90 seconds.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The hurdles lack the sex appeal of the 100-meter dash, but the event is a premier Olympic attraction because of its combination of speed, power and grace — and its potential for calamity. The best hurdlers need about 38 steps to leave the blocks, navigate 10 hurdles and reach the finish line 110 meters away. To watch a race is to suffer the illusion that you are seeing men running at top speed while jumping at the same time. You are really seeing them attempt to solve a complex physics equation without crashing. “In hurdles, you never actually get to maximum speed,” says Curtis Frye, one of the top hurdling coaches in the United States. “Every time you get near it, you’ve got to jump in the air. It’s not as much about speed as it is about mechanics.” Frye categorizes hurdlers into two groups: blasters and accelerators. Blasters are often shorter and have powerful legs like sprinters. They explode out of the blocks, quickly reaching a high speed, but that speed, if unchecked, can be a handicap if it pushes them too close to a hurdle. Frye says hurdlers must maintain the flattest possible parabola over each hurdle. To do so means mastering a three-step shuffle between each hurdle in order to leap from a perfect takeoff point. Frye notes that taller hurdlers with longer strides sometimes leap too close to a hurdle, a mistake that slows them down. At 6-foot-2, Liu is one of the taller elite hurdlers, but he has a reputation for rarely making mistakes once the race is underway. He’s an accelerator, Frye says, because he steadily builds speed and maintains his rhythm. As Frye explains, physics dictates that an athlete can create speed between the second and sixth hurdles but that the rest of the race is a contest of survival in which mechanics prevail. Liu’s mechanics are considered the best in the world. “Liu Xiang does not make an error,” Frye says. “He never beats himself. And the great hurdlers take advantage of other hurdlers’ errors. The guy who has the best mechanics and is the most efficient is going to win. That was Allen Johnson for a long time. And then it became Liu Xiang.” Johnson, once coached by Frye, is the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and a four-time world outdoor champion. He was one of the prerace favorites in Athens until he stumbled in the second round. At 37, he tried and failed to qualify for Beijing during the United States Olympic trials in July. “He’s not superspectacular anywhere,” Johnson says of Liu. “The thing that is so great about him is that he doesn’t really have a bad part of his race. It’s all good. He very rarely makes a mistake that is going to significantly impact his race.”  Photo        PING-PONGS NOT HIS GAME: Liu in a heat on his way to winning the 2007 World Championships.   Credit David Guttenfelder/Associated Press    But Johnson says technical prowess should not be confused with invulnerability. “Everybody has a weakness,” he says.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Liu’s recent problems in the starting blocks might offer a clue. When I saw him in May, he shrugged off his false start at the National Stadium. But Sun Haiping, his hurdling coach, was more concerned. Sun said they had been tinkering with Liu’s start before the race and had shifted his weight two or three centimeters forward in his stance. Sun crouched into position to show how the shift had wrongly placed greater pressure on Liu’s fingertips. They scrapped the idea. “His starting technique is not so steady,” Sun says. “We are going to pay more attention to that.” Sun knows Liu better than anyone. He has essentially been Liu’s guardian since the hurdler was a teenager. Liu grew up in a lower-income district of Shanghai, raised largely by his grandparents while his parents worked. At 9.9 pounds, he was a huge baby by Chinese standards. Athletics came easily to him. His family enrolled him in the district’s sports elementary school. Coaches examined his bone structure, his large feet and his long Achilles tendons and concluded that he was a high jumper. He was in fourth grade. By age 16, Liu was at the Shanghai No. 2 Sports School, one of the city’s top training centers. His high jumping results were good but he had started to plateau. Doctors and coaches examined and tested his bone structure, concluding he would not grow tall enough to be an elite high jumper. This selection process, so Orwellian to Western sensibilities, is not unusual in Chinese sports schools. A system so intensely focused on producing Olympic champions regards X-rays and bone tests as practical tools to help project which kid among thousands might one day become a medalist. Liu had done some hurdling, and so his coaches decided that would be his focus. He began training with his school’s B team because he was the youngest member of the program. And though his talent quickly became obvious, he was teased and beaten by older teammates until his family decided to drop athletics and transfer him to a regular school. Sun was coaching the senior team and was not directly responsible for Liu. But now he intervened. In what has become a famous tale in China, Sun lobbied Liu’s parents to keep him in the sports program. He promised to help him develop as an athlete and teach him to be a good man. The extended Liu family convened a meeting and voted against returning. But the father, Liu Xuegen, overruled the majority. “I trusted Sun,” Liu’s father says. “He was a responsible man and a famous coach.” Sun promoted Liu to the senior team and oversaw his training. At different times, they lived in the same apartment. Liu would take classes for half a day and train the other half. He quickly demonstrated a competitive fire that no X-ray could reveal. By 18, he was dominating national competitions, and he’d already begun to race abroad against other elite hurdlers. “When he first went to international competitions, he said foreigners had bigger muscles,” his father recalls. “He was fearful.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   His confidence grew as his performances steadily improved. In July 2002, he broke the world junior record at a major event in Switzerland and then won his Athens gold in 2004. Last year, he won his first world championship. In March, he won the indoor world championship in the 60-meter hurdles. He no longer feared the big-muscled foreigners. Now they worried about him. “He is in people’s heads,” Frye says. “Even if you don’t see him out of the corner of your eye, you know he’s there. And you know he is not going to change his rhythm. It causes them to try to go faster. Then they run up on hurdles, and they make mistakes.” Pressure: Cathy Freeman understands it. Like Liu, she seemed to carry the hopes of an entire nation. When Sydney hosted the 2000 Olympics, Australia placed its smothering expectations on her shoulders as she sought to become the first Aborigine to win an individual Olympic gold medal. She had a private team provide a protective cocoon against what she now calls “peripherals”: media, sponsors and the crush of expectations. “It’s an unnatural existence,” she told me, speaking by telephone from Melbourne. “But then when you are in the class of doing something remarkable, what is natural? You become a prisoner to your own success. That’s just life. Billie Jean King said pressure is a privilege. I never forgot that.” Freeman, 35, is retired and devoting her time to the Catherine Freeman Foundation, which helps aboriginal girls. There are about 20 million people in Australia, and they exulted when Freeman flew around the backstretch and took gold in the 400 meters. But consider that Liu’s hometown of Shanghai, alone, has almost 20 million people. “He is under more pressure than I was,” Freeman says, laughing. “I’m glad my career is over.” It’s true that pressure cannot be quantified; expectations cannot be bundled together and placed on a scale. But it is commonly accepted in China that Liu runs with the weight of the nation on his shoulders. His coaches do not doubt it. Senior government sports officials told them that Liu’s past achievements would be meaningless if he does not win in Beijing. When I met Liu in late May, he tried to downplay the expectations. He said this is the “athletic period” of his life. “I have to live even after this period,” he said. “I think I have done very well up to now.” No matter what happens in Beijing, he plans to keep racing and compete in London at the 2012 Olympics. After that, he may retire. “I don’t want to spend all my life on this event,” he said. “I would like to do something else, to learn other things.” He has admitted to nerves in the past, even as he has overcome them. Moments after he won the world championship, he told reporters that the days before the race had been “torture.” Now he stays on script. He says he is preparing for Beijing as if it were just another meet.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   His coach knows otherwise. “The pressure and expectations are too large,” Sun says. “Everyone hopes he can be the Olympic champion again in Beijing. But it is not as easy as the spectators believe. So we are trying our best.” Then he blushed slightly and smiled. “Maybe the pressure is greater on me than him.” Liu skipped his usual summer races in Europe, preferring to train in Beijing. Freeman says he should concentrate on simple things — like breathing. “Honestly,” she says. But she also offered a perspective made clearer by retirement: expectations came from all directions, but ultimately, she ran for herself, because it was what she enjoyed most. China is not Stalinist Russia. Liu will not be exiled to some gulag if he loses. Liu’s China is a mass of contradictions, a weird mix of Socialist sports schools and Starbucks. He is supposed to win for the glory of the Communist Party, and for his corporate sponsors, too. He is living with his coach in a dorm even though he makes eight figures. Pressure is everywhere; coherence is nowhere to be found. But with so much attention on whether Liu will win, or how he copes with the pressure, or even when he’ll find a girlfriend, Liu usually ducks the simplest question of all: why does he run? In mid-June, I met Liu’s father in a hotel lobby in Shanghai and posed that question. He sipped tea and smoked expensive cigarettes. He was a cheerful man whose cellphone kept ringing. I asked about the world record. “He said he admired Robles’s performance and that he has great talent,” Liu Xuegen said. “He has said, ‘I can’t keep the record for a lifetime. This time, he broke my record. Next time, I am confident I can grab his.’ ” Weeks earlier, I had listened to Liu’s careful answers and witnessed his carefully restricted existence inside the sports ministry, and he had not betrayed a hint of brashness. So these comments, even secondhand, startled me. Perhaps I had just become too accustomed to Chinese modesty and deference. What elite athlete isn’t fired by ego and a thirst for individual glory? Maybe that is why 1.3 billion people so desperately want him to win. They are navigating the same mass of contradictions. Conformity is still the safest route, but it is rarely the most satisfying. Yes, Liu runs for China. But he also runs for himself. “He has said that he didn’t want to be great only once,” his father said. “He said he wanted to keep being great as long as possible because nobody can be a hero forever.” .
