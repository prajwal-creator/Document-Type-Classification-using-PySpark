Questions can be sent to stuarte@nytimes.com . Q. I wanted to know about two recent ads in Parade for Newport Red, the non- menthol Newport cigarettes. Since it’s a family publication, I was surprised to see the ads. Can you tell me about the Parade policies about accepting tobacco ads? A. “Yes, Parade does accept tobacco advertising,” says Susan Ollinick, a spokeswoman at Parade, part of the Parade Publications unit of Advance Publications in New York. Ms. Ollinick passes along a copy of the e-mail that Parade sends in reply to questions about its policies on cigarette ads that are directed to Jack Haire, president and chief executive at Parade Publications, or Maggie Murphy, editorial director.

In terms of your concern regarding the appearance of cigarette advertising in Parade, it is the policy of our magazine’s business staff to accept tobacco advertising, which is a legal product for sale to adults throughout the United States.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       “Parade’s advertising team complies with all restrictions placed on these ads by the F.D.A., and they are clearly marked with the required warning labels,” the response continues. “Parade’s editorial team does not condone or endorse any of the products advertised in Parade. If you have any further questions, please feel free to e-mail me.” (“F.D.A.” refers to the Food and Drug Administration.) Cigarette commercials have not appeared on television or radio in more than 40 years, during which time cigarette ads in magazines have dwindled. They began disappearing in large numbers after 1998, when tobacco companies agreed not to aim cigarette ads at young Americans. (Some magazines, like Good Housekeeping, had policies against accepting cigarette ads for decades before that.) The tobacco companies adopted various guidelines for reducing the number of youth who might see cigarette ads in magazines. They said they would not advertise in magazines with more than a certain percentage of young readers, which ranged from 15 to 25 percent.

But those ads, for both varieties of Newport, have returned recently, appearing in magazines like Car and Driver, InStyle and Life & Style in addition to Parade. Q. I love the ESPN commercial “starring” Michael Jordan , which features an ordinary man named Michael Jordan who disappoints quite a few people — medical office receptionists, pizza and flower delivery people, car service driver, restaurant maitre ’d — when they realize that their encounter will not be with the basketball star. I am wondering if the name of the actor is, in fact, Michael Jordan, and if he has had those experiences? A. To borrow the title of a very funny 1941 movie, dear reader, you probably will not say “Here comes Mr. Jordan” next time you watch the commercial. According to Amy Phillips, a spokeswoman for the ESPN unit of the Walt Disney Company, the actor in the spot is named Buzz Bovshow. However, Ms. Phillips does pass along remarks on Twitter from an actor named Michael B. Jordan , whose handle is @michaelb4jordan. He sent his followers a link to the commercial along with this comment: “Do u know how hard it was to grow up with the Greatest Basketball Player in the world’s name?”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The commercial is part of a campaign for ESPN that carries the theme “It’s not crazy. It’s sports.” The campaign is created by the New York office of Wieden & Kennedy.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
