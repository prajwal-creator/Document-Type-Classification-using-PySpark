Ms. Cooper and Mr. Macrae, who is known as Jack, agreed to let Ms. Leibovitz stay in the building, at 465 West 23rd Street, for a few months while she continues the long-running renovation of a trio of Greenwich Village town houses where she ultimately plans to live. Ms. Cooper said she and her husband expected to move into one of the London Terrace penthouses in the fall. In the last week of June they put their current home, a 25-foot-wide town house in Chelsea, on the market for $7.9 million. It is listed with Jan Hashey, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman. Mr. Macrae said the deal for Ms. Leibovitz's apartments had been in the works for months and was very complex in an "only in New York" kind of way. "You can't imagine how complicated," he said.

She later bought the adjoining unit, Penthouse A, which was occupied by a renter who had been living in the building for decades. As part of the purchase, the tenant received what Mr. Macrae described as "a life tenancy." Ms. Leibovitz then got permission to knock down a wall and added a bedroom from the tenant's unit to her own, according to Susan Singer, a vice president with the Corcoran Group who specializes in the building and who recently showed the penthouses to a client. The tenant remains and Ms. Cooper and Mr. Macrae will be able to occupy only the apartment used by Ms. Leibovitz.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Ms. Singer said her client had been told the renter was paying significantly less than the $2,455 monthly maintenance for the second penthouse. Ms. Singer said that a few months ago, when her client was looking at the units, Ms. Leibovitz was seeking close to $6 million for the pair, but she said that she had been told by someone close to the deal that Ms. Cooper and Mr. Macrae paid about $5 million. Ms. Cooper and Mr. Macrae would not say how much they had paid. Both penthouses have large terraces. "They have outdoor space and lots of light," Ms. Cooper said. Ms. Cooper and Mr. Macrae had been looking for an apartment in London Terrace, a co-op, for some time. They had bought a two-bedroom apartment on the floor below Ms. Leibovitz's penthouse but then learned that she was interested in selling and began negotiations with her. They put their other apartment, on the 19th floor, on the market, through Bruce Solomon of Prudential Douglas Elliman, with an asking price of $1.795 million. They sold it last month to another of Ms. Singer's clients. Ms. Cooper and Mr. Macrae are fixtures in the Chelsea art world. Ms. Cooper's gallery is at 534 West 21st Street. Mr. Macrae owns a bookstore, 192 Books, around the corner on 10th Avenue. Their town house is on West 21st Street, a block from the gallery. And now they are moving to West 23rd Street. "Our whole lives are circumscribed by three blocks," Mr. Macrae said. Ms. Leibovitz did not return phone calls. Her broker, Alf Naman, said he was not permitted to discuss the sale. The Sun Sets on the Sunshine Group IT is a classic story in American business: a hard-charging entrepreneur sells a small but successful company to a large corporation and within a very short time, the hard-charging entrepreneur is on the outside looking in. It took exactly three years and two days for Louise Sunshine to exit from the real estate marketing company that she started and named after herself, the Sunshine Group, after she sold it on June 27, 2002, to NRT, which also owns the Corcoran Group, one of the city's largest brokerage firms.

Instead, it was folded into Corcoran and merged with a division there that does similar work consulting with developers and marketing new developments.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ms. Sunshine will take the title of chairwoman emeritus and she will work as a full-time consultant with her former employees. She said that her consulting contract will last a year and can be renewed, and that she was committed to seeing through all the projects she has started until sales have been completed. Everyone involved was working hard to make the move look as if it was, well, full of sunshine. But it was hard not to see it as at least partly cloudy. Ms. Sunshine is something of a force of nature in the world of high-end New York real estate. Starting some 20 years ago, she helped to pioneer a way of selling real estate by working with developers to help shape their new buildings and then marketing the outcome as a form of luxury goods. She marketed and sold some of the signal projects of the current boom: the Time Warner Center, One Beacon Court, the three buildings designed in the far West Village by the architect Richard Meier, and the conversion of the old J.P. Morgan headquarters in Lower Manhattan, opposite the New York Stock Exchange. Of course, Ms. Sunshine would never call them projects: she preferred "developments," saying it conveyed a more upscale image. She spoke of marketing penthouses with high ceilings in terms of cubic feet, rather than the more modest square feet. And she aggressively pursued wealthy art collectors as customers, trumpeting her buildings as showcases for fine art. But Ms. Sunshine is also known for a forceful personality. She was successful being her own boss, but people who know her and have worked with her said she clashed frequently with executives at NRT, a subsidiary of the Cendant Corporation. Her business also grew significantly in the last three years, and with that came added pressures to operate the company in a more traditional way. People who spent some time around her said that the last few months, as her new status was being hammered out, have been stormy ones. "This was my choice because I wanted to really focus on the creative things that I was doing and not on the operational aspects of running the company," Ms. Sunshine said. The Sunshine employees will now answer to Pamela Liebman, Corcoran's chief executive and a regional vice president for NRT. Ms. Liebman said that the new division would be called Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group and that projects would still be marketed using the Sunshine brand name. When Ms. Sunshine, accompanied by Ms. Liebman, announced her new status to her staff on Wednesday, her senior managing director, James Lansill, stood up and quoted George Bernard Shaw, who said: "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man." Mr. Lansill quipped that after working with Ms. Sunshine he understood that Shaw was almost right: he just got the gender wrong. Ms. Sunshine said his words brought tears to her eyes. The other people at the meeting might have had a hard time telling. Ms. Sunshine wore dark glasses.
