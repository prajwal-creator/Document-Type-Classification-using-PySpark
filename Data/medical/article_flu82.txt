It will be accompanied by photos of old, comfortable, perhaps mud-stained, but never unloved, Timberland shoes. The creative effort will be backed by a domestic media budget of $4 million, an enormous rise from last year's $1.7 million. With the exception of some radio and outdoor advertising that may be used in development markets, all of the money will find its way into magazines as four-color spreads and single pages. Last year the company had two separate campaigns, one featuring the famous waterproof work shoe and the other, the boat shoe that competes with Sperry Topsiders. The new advertising that will begin to appear in March issues emphasizes the brand name and will always include an inset photograph of shoes from each of the company's four categories (boots, rugged casuals, loafers and boat shoes), as well as the name of the person who has contributed the old shoes. Yesterday, Sidney Swartz, who owns the Hampton, N.H., company with his brother, Herman, who was home with the flu, came to town to meet with John S. Thorbeck, his vice president of marketing, and the top brass of the agency, o discuss the campaign with a passer-by.

He returned to active duty briefly in the early seventies at the request of his two sons to design a truly waterproof and insulated boot that would be sold as a branded product. Its first agency, Marvin & Leonard in Boston, developed the strategy that is still being used, ''Boots that cost plenty and should.''

That included sales in 17 other countries in Europe and Asia. SSC&B:Lintas, which took over the account in August, is the agency in 11 of the countries.

The headlines to top off the old-shoe campaign are a clue as to where the copy is going: ''Years from now you may have to replace the laces,'' ''As time goes by you learn who your friends are,'' and, over the picture of a closet full of Timberlands, ''Some people just can't seem to get enough of a good thing.'' The ads will appear in Sports Illustrated, Playboy, Gentleman's Quarterly and Esquire, all of which carried Timberland ads last year, as well as in The New Yorker (which marks a return), M magazine, Outside, Runner, Rolling Stone, Ski, as well as a number of hunting and marine publiations. Meanwhile, moving up a bit from footwear, Timberland has acquired an apparel company in Sag Harbor, L.I., called Atlantis Weather Gear, and the agency is working on advertising ideas for it, too.
