But in equally large part, the fate of school sports was determined by individuals -- people who made a difference or who did not, who tried to defend athletics or who stood idly by on the sidelines. Ed Reynolds fought back. Reynolds, the principal of West Side High School in Manhattan, became so angry that the 350 students at his alternative school could get no money from the city for sports that he formed his own league and ran it himself. Organizing the city's expanding group of smaller, specialized high schools beginning in the 1970's, Reynolds pushed and prodded and insisted that sports for students mattered. And it worked. Now, the more than four dozen alternative high schools like West Side get money from the Board of Education that, while paltry compared to schools around much of the nation or in the New York metropolitan area, is better than nothing. The schools now participate in interscholastic sports alongside the oldest and largest schools in the city. ''You don't have to yell,'' Reynolds said of the lessons he learned in his battles over sports. ''But you do have to be aggressive -- you have to continually lobby for your position, you have to write letters and organize meetings, you have to be sort of a crusader,'' he said.

Most others would not, or could not. The pattern of de-emphasis of sports and physical education came from the top down, as Board of Education administrators cut and cut financing and never restored it, and partly from the bottom up as parents stopped caring as much or pushed for other school improvements. Principals were caught in the middle.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Most took the meager amount of money doled out by the Public Schools Athletic League -- the Board of Education's administrative arm for high school sports -- and did what they could. They found ways to raise more money through stopgap measures or they eliminated a sport here or a gym class there as they balanced their budgets and their needs for books, materials and teachers. Athletics programs, as they struggled, came more and more to mirror everything that works and does not work about the New York City school system: varying resources from neighborhood to neighborhood, varying levels of commitment and ability from school to school, and always and everywhere a seemingly constant conflict over politics and labor and management and who was or should be in charge. Schools chancellors came and went like waves on the beach. Frank J. Macchiarola tried to rebuild some of the sports program in the late 1970's and early 1980's, and the current schools chief, Rudy Crew, has added back money in the late 1990's. But the deeper structural problems remained. Now, in the city's first concerted effort in years to rethink and retool how it runs its high school sports programs, it has decided that the answer is to decentralize authority further, giving more responsibility to individual schools. What many principals and teachers had seen as a symptom of the erosion in commitment and money from the center -- decentralized sports programs that seemed orphaned and at the mercy of local neighborhood economics -- has now been embraced as a cure. Leaders on the scene, the city has said, really do know best. Under the plan, parts of which are being put in place now, principals will be charged with insuring that athletes are academically eligible and medically fit to compete and that coaches are certified. Principals will enforce rules and assume legal liability for mishaps or oversights. ''We're now trying to say to the principals, 'It's your show,' '' said Thomas Hemans, the director of the P.S.A.L., which has until now scheduled games, set rules, hired officials and certified the training of coaches since its creation in 1903. Consequences and Politics Caught in a Battle Involving Principals The overhaul plan has in turn opened a new debate about what school sports could be and should be. Some principals and teachers say the city is giving up on the idea of systemwide improvement, while accepting the diminished state that sports has assumed. Some say they believe that the overhaul represents real hope of improvement. Still others say the timing, coming in the middle of a pitched battle between the city and the principals' union over tenure, promises to make school sports more of a political issue than ever. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has pushed to eliminate tenure for principals -- a move the principals' union has rejected. Even principals who think the sports overhaul is a positive step say that greater decentralization will make the inequities between poor and middle-class schools more profound -- or at the very least leave the problems unaddressed -- because each school will be left more on its own than ever.

Baxter, the principal of Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Fordham section of the Bronx; the district has a 100 percent poverty rate among its students and no athletic fields at all. ''But I think it's going to make it more difficult for the schools to be competitive -- truly competitive.'' The principal of New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn, Howard J. Lucks, also believes the changes -- contained in a new rule book given to principals last year -- have some positive aspects, notably the new section on sports and ethics. But for all the good intentions, he said, decentralized authority will inevitably mean unevenness of application. ''I think it's very difficult for every school to have the same kind of program,'' he said. Phil Watnick, the girls' track coach at South Shore High School in Brooklyn, questioned the wisdom of further burdening principals. The new plan simply will not work, he said, because principals are already overwhelmed by the responsibilities they have. ''How much do you want to put on their heads?'' he asked. Other administrators and sports officials, however, say that the city may have stumbled onto an important truth: that for all that principals did not do as the city's commitment declined, people like Reynolds -- scattered here and there across the system -- kept sports programs alive. ''Sometimes, I think it's a miracle that high school sports even survived in New York,'' said Arthur Greenberg, the schools superintendent for District 25 in Queens and a principal in the 1980's. What is indisputable about the city's sports overhaul is that it comes at the expense of the P.S.A.L. Indeed, a Board of Education task force last year concluded that the P.S.A.L. , which administers sports programs for 165 high schools and 2,361 boys' and girls' teams, had to a great extent failed. Its staff of eight full-time employees and its network of coaches and athletic directors who serve as part-time commissioners for individual sports had been overwhelmed, the report said, by the sharp growth in the number of high schools in the 1990's and the explosion of girls' teams that the city was forced by Federal law to create in recent years. The P.S.A.L.'s new role is more consultant than administrator. It will schedule games between schools, arrange for officials and umpires and offer advice about rules and procedures when asked.

In the century's early decades, when New York City's system of high school sports and physical education was being built, and being seen as a national model, the agency was a central -- sometimes autocratic -- voice and authority and advocate for the value and necessity of school sports. In the name of greater local control, that unifying voice, however much it had already been eclipsed, has been silenced.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But many principals also fear that downsizing the P.S.A.L., whatever the result for students, will make sports more political in New York by injecting the issue directly into one of the most divisive subjects in public education: tenure for principals. The Board of Education and Giuliani are leading vehement campaigns to chip away at or eliminate tenure for principals. In such an environment of acrimony, some principals say they believe the overhaul will change the traditional politics of money for sports into the politics of blame. Greater local control has raised the specter, some principals say, of a kind of Trojan horse -- a huge extra task, cast as an improvement, that principals cannot possibly keep up with, given all their other duties. The new rule book could come back to haunt them, they say, as a prosecutorial exhibit with the first major scandal of poor enforcement or student injury. ''The burden is now placed on the principals; if anything goes wrong, they can always point the finger at us,'' said Bruce Schnur, the principal of Liberty High School, a small specialized school in Manhattan mainly for new immigrants. The principals' union, for its part, sees little change in the status quo. Sports will be made better, union officials say, because principals are more capable and competent than P.S.A.L. staffers. ''I think it will amount to a more effective administration of the sports programs and less chance for violations to take place,'' said Norman Sherman, the high school director for the principals' union, the Council of Supervisors and Administrators. Crew, the city's Schools Chancellor, said he believed that spending increases for sports in the last few years -- and his own statements of commitment -- had changed the debate: The question is no longer survival, he said, but rather how to create the proper role for sports going forward. Crew said in an interview that athletics must become part of a broader educational effort aimed at putting students onto what he calls a ''road of personal competency.'' Arts education and internships, in which students can get experience outside school in real-life working situations, are others. ''I would argue that there are many ways of being able to scale that road,'' he said. ''And I have not chosen one over the other -- I'm saying all three have to be present.'' Crew said he thought it was probably reasonable for principals to feel cynical about the recent changes for sports, given the long, dismal record of retrenchment. But he said he hoped to embed athletics once again so firmly in the curriculum that it would not be the first to fall when tough budget times return.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   All across New York -- and in schools all over the nation -- educators are wrestling with similar questions. At a time of taxpayer revolts and state mandates for better academic performance, the question of how and whether to fit sports in -- let alone finance them seriously -- has become a burning question. And as the public schools have struggled, the number of new private groups seeking a new path for sports, or seeking to help finance existing programs, has exploded. In many corners of the city, in and out of the school system, people are searching for new vehicles to provide sports and are articulating new ideas about their value and role in youth development. One group, for example, that is held out by some educators as a model of what school sports could be is a five-year-old program in Harlem called the Urban Youth Bike Corps. The group is ostensibly about biking, said its director, Erik A. Cliette. But Cliette said that biking was in many ways just a cover story. The corps blends physical and emotional and academic development, all revolving around bike-riding trips, bicycle maintenance, personal responsibility and academic achievement, with all expenses paid for by private and corporate sponsors. It is like school sports in its focus on physical development and training, he said, but with the emphasis shifted to a broad and structured coming-of-age strategy. And many school officials, in struggling to keep sports programs going, have reached back to these private-sector efforts as well, forming public-private partnerships -- some as ambitious as raising money for a new gymnasium, some as small as the bats and balls that are being provided to several local school teams by the Shooting Gallery, a Manhattan-based movie production company that recently created a foundation to raise money for New York City public school teams. Optimism and Resignation A Need for Change, And Faith as Well Many principals say they are optimistic about the changes at the P.S.A.L. mainly because they say the administration of sports could not get much worse. At Liberty High School, for example, which has only three sports teams -- boys' and girls' volleyball and coed bowling -- Schnur, the principal, said that his new responsibilities had resulted in changes already. Students who want to use the gym after school must now provide proof that they have had a physical examination. That rule, he said, has probably been on the books for years, if not decades, but in the hands of the P.S.A.L. it was never enforced. ''It was essential that it be changed,'' said Eileen Taylor, the principal at Aviation High School in Queens and an enthusiastic supporter of the overhaul. ''More accountability is built in, and it's more realistic.'' Most school officials, though, said that keeping sports going in New York -- no matter what changes are made in the name of reform -- had become a matter of faith. Either you believe that it can be done, they said, or you don't.

I think they're out there somewhere.''  Continue reading the main story        Weâre interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
