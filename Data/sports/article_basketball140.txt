In the final seconds of a tense 86-85 exhibition victory over Spain on Sunday night, a slice of orange bailed out the United States. The Americans used a tactical shift on the final possession to secure a hard-fought victory over the defending world champion. Leading by a point with 16.9 seconds left, the United States showed its typical man-to-man before moving to a 2-3 zone, a defense Boeheim has practically trademarked during his career at Syracuse. Spain froze momentarily, and Kevin Durant blocked two low-quality shots by Spain, a long jumper by Ricky Rubio and a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer by Rudy Fernandez, to seal the victory.

Durant broke out of his shooting slump to lead all scorers with 25 points, and Derrick Rose started in place of Rajon Rondo and hit the winning free throws.

Considered by many around the world as a collection of B-level stars, they began to forge an identity as a hyperathletic and scrappy defensive team that could be considered the favorite heading into the world championships beginning Saturday in Turkey. “Guys are excited but not overly excited,” guard Chauncey Billups said. “Although this is an exhibition game, that team is a machine.” When Durant blocked Fernandez’s shot and the buzzer sounded, the American bench players ran onto the court to celebrate. Inside the sold-out arena known as the Magic Box, the deafening noise disappeared and the house band, which had been blaring tunes like the “Rocky” theme song all night, stopped playing. “We made one more play than they did, and that’s why we won,” Krzyzewski said. American basketball coaches are rarely credited for their tactics at the international level; they are expected to have the most athletic and talented team. But what made the move to the 2-3 zone so effective was the coaching staff’s understanding of a nuance of international rules.

Credit Sergio Perez/Reuters    Team USA expected Spain to run a high screen-and-roll for Juan Carlos Navarro, who led Spain with 20 points and prompted Boeheim to say, half kidding, that he had scored on that play on five consecutive possessions. Instead, when the United States went to the zone, Spain had to scrap its play and could not call another timeout because FIBA rules do not allow them in the middle of possessions.

The most surprising part of the game was the absence of Rondo, who had been the starting point guard, for the entire game. Krzyzewski said that Rondo and Danny Granger did not play because they were veterans and the coaches knew what they were getting out of them. Rose said that Rondo was sick with a sinus problem, although that notion was later dismissed.

After a screen from Lamar Odom, Rose scored an acrobatic left-handed layup to give the Americans an 84-82 lead with 32.9 seconds left. After Navarro answered with a 3-point play to give Spain the lead at 85-84, Rose made two free throws with 16.9 seconds left for the game’s final points. “When you want your legacy to finally end, this is something that some people are going to remember,” Rose said. “Over here, people are going to remember this if they don’t see me play anymore.” Krzyzewski told the team at its shootaround that he was changing the starting lineup because Team USA had started slowly in exhibition games against France and Lithuania. Odom started in place of Tyson Chandler, who had no points or shots in 20 minutes against Lithuania on Saturday .

When asked what his 13-point performance meant for his chances to win the starting job, Rose smiled and shook his head. “I wouldn’t say winning; it’s a team thing right here,” he said. “It’s not about that.” Rose’s presence, and another energy jolt off the bench from Russell Westbrook (8 points), helped the United States play faster and more aggressively than it did against Lithuania. It seems clear that this team, made up  mostly of young, second-tier stars, will have to win by playing with great tempo and exploiting its superior athleticism. And a good call from the bench does not hurt, either. Boeheim broke into a big smile after the game when asked about going to “orange.” “What else would you call it?” he said. Although it was only an exhibition, the Americans head to Athens for a tuneup against Greece on Wednesday with what they can certainly say was a satisfying victory.
