To Che? To Chez? Touché!   By CLYDE HABERMAN JUNE 17, 2005     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           The Yankees said this week that the new playpen planned for them in the Bronx will continue to be known as Yankee Stadium, even if naming rights to pieces of it may be sold to corporate sponsors. But what about that other new ballpark for New York, the one that is supposed to rise in Queens? Will it remain Shea Stadium? This stadium is Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's Plan B, which he was forced to embrace after his West Side dream crashed and burned. The idea now is to build a new home in Queens for the Mets, reconfigure it for the 2012 Olympics and pray that the International Olympic Committee buys into the deal. Perhaps fervent America haters on the committee can be wooed by convincing them that the place is really known as Che Stadium. More seriously, what to call the Queens ballpark is a question that has received little attention. The Mets are not saying much. "I don't think there has been any discussion on this," said a team spokesman, Owen Bochner.

The team has an option to sell or lease naming rights to the new stadium, said Edward Skyler, Mr. Bloomberg's communications director. "We don't know if the Mets will sell the naming rights," Mr. Skyler said, "but we assume they will."

The prospect leaves them decidedly unthrilled. Would they want things to stay as they are? "Of course we would," said F. Scott Shea, a transplanted New Yorker practicing law in Los Angeles. "My grandfather worked very hard to get baseball back to New York." It is probably safe to say that few New Yorkers today recognize the name of his grandfather, William A. Shea, or why it graces this stadium that has stood for 41 years. Even people who should know often don't. "Shea was an engineer, I believe," a government official in Queens said the other day. No, he wasn't. He was a lawyer and a power broker of the first order. After the baseball Dodgers and Giants absconded to California in 1957, Mayor Robert F. Wagner turned to William Shea to fill the city's National League void. The result was the advent of New York Metropolitan Baseball Club Inc., immediately adored even as it set records for haplessness on the field.

Mr. Shea said at the time that Wagner's name should have gone on the stadium, but the mayor felt otherwise. "There never would have been a stadium if it hadn't been for Bill," he said. Mr. Shea died in 1991 at 84. Three years later, so did his mighty Manhattan law firm, Shea & Gould. His obituary said he had once jokingly predicted that the stadium would be renamed 15 minutes after he was gone. Some have certainly tried. Dropping Mr. Shea's name in favor of Jackie Robinson's is one idea with legs. It still makes sense to Archie Spigner, who proposed such a change years ago when he was a city councilman from Queens. Robinson was "a trailblazer," Mr. Spigner said. "With all due respect to Shea," he said, "who the hell is he?" You can almost feel Mr. Shea's relatives wince over the phone. "A lot of people today don't know who he was and don't know all that he did for the city," said Kathy Anfuso, a daughter of Mr. Shea's who lives in Portland, Ore.

"If the name was to be changed," Mrs. Anfuso said, "I would hope that it would be to the value that it has been, to the substance that it has been -- that it wouldn't be another FedEx Field or whatever." Then again, she said, selling naming rights to the highest corporate bidder is a fact of modern sports life. F. Scott Shea, who used to sit with his grandfather watching the Mets, made a similar point from Los Angeles. Ball club expenses "are phenomenal," he said, and "we don't want to begrudge the city or the Mets anything." "Put it this way," he said. "We would be honored if the name stayed the same. And if it were to change, we would hope it would be changed to something that is equally deserving of such an honor." First things first, though. A more immediate issue is the city's Olympics bid. Paris is the presumed favorite for 2012. But there may still be time to beat the French at their own game. Forget Che Stadium. Perhaps it would be best to let the international types think that the Queens site is this marvelously sophisticated place, known to everyone in New York as Chez Stadium.
