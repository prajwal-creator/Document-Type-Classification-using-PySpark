A new scientific tool for probing further into the inner mysteries of matter which, its discoverers hope, will furnish the first direct experimental evidence of the motion of electrons within the atoms of metals and other solids at the terrific speeds postulated by Bohr, propounder of the orbital theory of the electron on only indirect evidence, is described in the current issue of The Physical Review, official organ of the American Physical Society.
