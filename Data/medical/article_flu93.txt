On the ground floor, inside the entrance portico, Chief Justice Warren E.  Burger was expected to unveil a bronze statue of John Marshall, the nation's fourth Chief Justice and a pivotal figure who established the principle of judicial review. The statue, nearly seven feet tall, was carved by William Story, a 19th century artist whose father, Joseph, served on the Court with Marshall. What made the unveiling somewhat unusual was the fact that the statue had remained for years in an inconspicuous spot on the west side of the Capitol, buffetted by rain and snow. Forty years ago Congress voted to move the st atue to the Court, but somehow it was never done. A nd it was only during the hoopla surrounding President Reagan's inau guration, when workmen were sprucing up the Capitol, that someone decided to move Mr. Marshall to a more appropriate haven. After weeks of refurbishing and polishing, the statue was set for unveiling before dozens of Court employees. Some news photographers milled around with them, waiting to record the event. They waited for Chief Justice Burger. And waited. And soon it became clear that he would not appear at all. The word was finally passed that the Chief Justice had had second thoughts because, well, he didn't want to appear before photographers.

Then everyone drifted off, content in the knowledge that John Marshall was finally home. A bit late. A bit controversial.

Baker 3d, a Texan with a taste for Western art, often ponders the painting above the fireplace in his big office. The colorful work depicts a cowboy on a galloping horse, shooting over his shoulder at pursuing Indians. Just the other day, an American Indian delegation trooped into the White House for a session with Mr. Baker, and before departing someone suggested a photograph. As the Indians, flanking Mr. Baker, stood before the fireplace, smiling at the camera, an aide to Mr.  Baker suddenly stared up at the backdrop. Stop! came the order. Puzzled, Mr. Baker and the Indian visitors were escorted to a corner of the office where they resumed smiling before the camera. Wondering, perhaps, if the lighting wasn't just a bit off near that fireplace.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It has been billed as offering ''the finest New York has to offer - in entertainment, fashion, food, cuisine and gaiety.'' Sponsors of the event, scheduled for tonight at the Washington Hilton, say it is designed to mix business leaders with politicians and Administration officials. But now, like a ride on the IRT at 2 in the morning, the tension has become unsettling. Joe Namath, the former football great, has canceled out as master of ceremonies because, sponsors say, he has the flu. President Reagan and Vice President Bush, who were invited, have apparently dec lined. Mayor Koch, one of honorary co-chairmen, won't appear because of his father's death. A nd Governor Carey has not yet made up his mind. And then comes the unexpected problem of those pesky journalists.  For reasons not entirely clear, reporters have been barred from most of the offerings. Representative Charles B. Rangel, co-chairman of the festival's Congressional advisory committee, said: ''It's a question of space in the hotel - the members of Congress and the hosts in a setting that's not overly crowded.'' The New York Democrat noted, however, that the decision was causing him ''problems.'' Later, Richard Brown, a Washington public affairs consultant who is coordinating the event, said that reporters would have been a ''blockage'' on the floor and ''deflected'' the invited businessmen, Congressmen and Administration officials from conferring privately. By the way, the button for the festival, reads, ''Come Love New York,'' with Love in the form of a big, welcoming heart. Sunday morning services at the Little Flower Parish in Bethesda, Md.: Seated in the same pew were Speaker of the House Thomas P.  O'Neill Jr., a Democratic liberal, and former Senator James Buckley of New York, an Under Secretary of State and a well-known conservative. On the way out, a woman who knows Mr. O'Neill came up to him and said: ''I see the church brings all her children together.'' Mr. O'Neill laughed.  Francis X.
