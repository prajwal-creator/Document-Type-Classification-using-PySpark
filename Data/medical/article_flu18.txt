McNEIL Jr. FEB. 24, 2012     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           The winter flu season has finally begun, federal health officials announced on Friday, making this the latest start to the season in 24 years — and thus far it is one of the mildest. The unusually warm winter this year “might play a role,” said Dr. Joseph Bresee, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Flu viruses survive longer on surfaces in cold, dry weather, and cold weather makes people huddle indoors, where they are more likely to transmit the disease. Far fewer Americans than usual have been hospitalized with flu, and there have been only 3 confirmed flu deaths among children thus far this season, compared with 122 last season and more than 200 during the swine flu pandemic of 2009-10, said Dr. Bresee, who is chief of epidemiology for the agency’s flu division. Only two states — California and Colorado — have reported widespread flu activity on the agency’s weekly FluView report.

In a typical American flu season, A(H1N1) is the most common strain, especially at the start.

And the 2009 pandemic strain, an A(H1N1), is predominant in Southeast Asia and in Mexico. “We could attempt to speculate why — but flu is inherently unpredictable,” Dr. Bresee said. Flu shots among the Americans most at risk — pregnant women and young children — have been “trending upward slowly but steadily,” Dr. Bresee added. “I’d still like to get to 80 percent coverage in those groups, and we’re not near that,” he said.
