Credit Romeo Ranoco/Reuters July 9, 2016 Serbia and Croatia are headed for Brazil, while France or Canada will claim the final spot in Olympic basketball. Serbia claimed its first Olympic appearance as an independent nation by crushing Puerto Rico, 108-77, on Saturday in the championship game of the Olympic qualifying tournament it hosted in Belgrade. Bogdan Bogdanovic had 26 points and 8 assists, while the tournament’s most valuable player, Nikola Jokic of the Denver Nuggets, added 23 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists. Croatia had a much tougher time, outlasting Italy, 84-78, in overtime in Turin. Bojan Bogdanovic of the Nets scored 26 points, the former Philadelphia 76ers lottery pick Dario Saric added 18 points and 13 rebounds, and the Croatians qualified for the Olympics for the first time since 2008. In Manila, fifth-ranked France eliminated eighth-ranked Turkey, 75-63, in a semifinal despite relatively quiet nights from most of its N.B.A. stars, including Tony Parker, Boris Diaw and Nicolas Batum. Diaw, who had 4 points, 7 rebounds and 2 assists, said France must overcome its habit of starting slowly. “Young guys came in to give us a lift for us to be able to win,” he said. Canada defeated New Zealand, 78-72, and will play France in Sunday’s final. BASEBALL Balk Helps Orioles in Win Over Angels Jonathan Schoop scored the tying run on a seventh-inning balk and delivered a decisive run-scoring single in the eighth inning to propel host Baltimore past the Los Angeles Angels, 3-2. The victory assured the Orioles of sole possession of first place in the American League East at the All-Star break. Mark Trumbo hit his major-league-leading 28th home run for Baltimore, a solo shot in the second inning. It was the Orioles’ 135th homer of the season, their most before the break. PIRATES CRUSH CUBS Josh Bell hit a grand slam in his second major league at-bat, one of four homers by host Pittsburgh in a 12-6 victory over Chicago. Bell slugged a 1-1 pitch from Adam Warren over the seats above the 21-foot wall in right field during his second pinch-hit opportunity in two games since being recalled from Class AAA on Friday. Jordy Mercer, Andrew McCutchen and Sean Rodriguez also homered for the Pirates, who have won nine of 10. GIANTS IMPROVE TO 56-33 Brandon Belt hit a run-scoring triple, Grant Green homered for the first time this season and San Francisco got a big lift from its bullpen in a 4-2 victory over the visiting Arizona Diamondbacks.

CARDINALS’ BARRAGE SINKS BREWERS Jhonny Peralta, Tommy Pham and Aledmys Diaz homered, helping Carlos Martinez and visiting St. Louis rout Milwaukee, 8-1. Peralta hit a leadoff drive in the second inning off Chase Anderson. During the Cardinals’ five-run ninth, Pham connected on a solo shot and Diaz belted a three-run homer.

GOLF Swede Increases Lead at Scottish Open Alex Noren of Sweden birdied the final two holes to extend his lead to two shots at the Scottish Open in Inverness after a third round that ended in heavy rain at the Castle Stuart links. Noren shot a four-under-par 68 to move to 12-under 204, two strokes ahead of Tyrrell Hatton of England (66) and Matteo Manassero of Italy (68). The top 15 players are separated by six shots in the final event before the British Open at Royal Troon, which begins on Thursday. Noren, the second-round leader by a shot, defied the blustery conditions by hitting a 219-yard tee shot to 3 feet on No. 17 and then getting up and down at the par-5 18th for another birdie. TWO TIED FOR FIRST AT CHAMPIONS TOUR EVENT Paul Goydos shot a six-under-par 66 to forge a tie for the lead with John Riegger after two rounds of the Dick’s Sporting Goods Open in Endicott, N.Y. Goydos made an eagle at the par-4 16th hole, and he followed with a birdie at No. 17 to finish at 11-under 133 with Riegger, who shot a 67. The first-round leader, Scott Dunlap, shot a 70 and was alone in second place, one shot behind. AUTO RACING Keselowski Edges Edwards in Kentucky Brad Keselowski became the first three-time winner at Kentucky Speedway, overtaking Kevin Harvick on Lap 201 and holding on for the Sprint Cup series victory in Sparta. Matt Kenseth grabbed the lead with six laps remaining but pitted for fuel and handed the top spot back to Keselowski, who had just enough gasoline in reserve to edge Carl Edwards by 0.175 of a second in a tense finish. Keselowski’s tank eventually ran dry, and he needed a tow to victory lane.

The move came after a frustrating season for the Rockets, who were ousted by the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the playoffs. They fired their coach, Kevin McHale, after a 4-7 start, and the interim coach, J. B. Bickerstaff, went 37-34 the rest of the way.

BULLFIGHTING Matador Dies After Being Gored A Spanish bullfighter became the first to die in the ring in three decades after being gored in front of horrified spectators in the eastern town of Teruel. Victor Barrio, 29, died of injuries to the chest after being struck by the horn of a bull weighing more than 1,100 pounds and tossed into the air. Other matadors rushed to the rescue, helping to distract the bull and lure him away while Barrio lay bleeding in the sand. Barrio, who made his bullfighting debut in 2008 and toured Spain, was pronounced dead at the scene, said Tauroemocion. His death was the first of a matador in the ring since 1985, Spanish news media reported.
