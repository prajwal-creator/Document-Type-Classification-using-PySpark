Would that have been a first? It would have been a 10th, but the last time it happened was 56 years ago in Washington. On the staff of the 1930 Senators, Lloyd Brown won 16 games, and General Crowder, Bump Hadley, Sad Sam Jones and Firpo Marberry won 15 apiece as Washington finished in second place with a 94-60 record, 8 games behind the Philadelphia Athletics. Two of the other eight teams with five 15-game winners in a season also failed to win pennants, both finishing second - the 1904 Chicago Cubs and the 1908 Pittsburgh Pirates. The remaining six teams were: the 1902 Pirates, 1905 New York Giants, 1907 Cubs, 1915 Boston Red Sox, 1923 Yankees and 1925 Pirates. All those teams also won the World Series in those years, except the 1902 Pirates, who didn't have a World Series to play in because there was none until 1903. QUESTION: Which major league pitcher was a 30-game winner the most times in his career? Since 1900, Christy Mathewson of the New York Giants heads this list of 13 pitchers with four such seasons: 37 in 1908, 33 in 1904, 31 in 1905 and 30 in 1903. Next is Grover Cleveland Alexander of the Philadelphia Phillies with three, and oddly both finished their Hall of Fame careers with 373 victories. In two of Mathewson's years (1903-4), a Giants' teammate, Joe McGinnity, also won more than 30 games, the only times that's ever happened to a team. In the American League, Cy Young of the 1901-02 Boston Pilgrims (now Red Sox) and Walter Johnson of the 1912-13 Washington Senators (now Minnesota Twins) are the only two-time 30-game winners, but two others, Jack Chesbro of the 1904 Highlanders (now Yankees) and Ed Walsh of the 1908 Chicago White Sox (still White Sox) are baseball's only 40-game winners since 1900. QUESTION: It's the bottom of the ninth and Team A not only has rallied to tie the score, but also has the winning run on third base, as well as runners on first and second, with only one out. The Team B pitcher eases matters a bit by getting the batter to miss the first two pitches. On the third one, the batter, attempting to protect the plate, hits a foul tip that strikes the chest protector of the catcher, who then grabs the ball just before it hits the ground. Thinking that the batter has struck out for the third out and ended the inning, the catcher casually rolls the ball toward the mound and heads for the dugout. At the same time, the runner from third heads for the plate. Can the runner score on this lapse by the catcher and win the game for Team A?

When the ball hit the catcher's protector, it did not qualify for a foul-tip third strike, for it had not been first touched by the catcher's hand or mitt. Without that condition, any rebound that is caught by the catcher means nothing because the foul tip has become merely a foul ball, just as if the batter had hit the ball into the stands behind him. The alert umpire would signal immediately that although there was a foul tip, the ball was dead and no runners could advance.

With no foul tip, though, the Team A runner from third would have to go back, the batter would resume his turn with an 0-2 count and the catcher would return to his position, perhaps crouching a bit lower and probably grateful that his foulup had been erased by a foul ball. QUESTION: An answer a couple of weeks ago involving the last time only American-born tennis players were in the United States Open men's and women's finals in the same year cited John McEnroe as one of the four. But wasn't he born in West Germany? Indeed he was, on Feb. 16, 1959, at an American Army base in Wiesbaden, where his father was stationed, which made John an American citizen if not one born in the U.S.A. In light of that technicality, there have never been four American-born singles finalists in the United States Open since its inception in 1968. The tournament's predecessor, the United States National championships, last had such finalists in 1953: Tony Trabert of Cincinnati defeating Vic Seixas of Philadelphia, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3, and Maureen Connolly of San Diego beating Doris Hart of Coral Gables, Fla., 6-2, 6-4, in a match that made Connolly the first woman to win the Grand Slam - Australian, French, English (Wimbledon) and United States champiohships in the same year.
