We talked about work, about whether to eat in or go out, about trivial gossip regarding the lives of our friends and (more trivially) those of celebrities. All this, however, has come to be replaced by a peculiar, often snippy back-and-forth that begins the moment we see each other and that, to the uninitiated, would sound a whole lot like gibberish. Rose: How many points? Me: 2,432. You? Rose: 5,468! Me: No! Rose: Yes! Me: Damn you! Let me see. . . . At which point Rose gleefully extends her right wrist, on which she is wearing the same black rubberized bracelet that I have on: a clever little device recently introduced by Nike that (per health-gadget protocol) goes by the steroidal name of FuelBand. Thanks to a so-called sport-tested accelerometer embedded inside, the band tracks your level of daily activity, breaking it down into a nebulous currency called NikeFuel. A pickup game of basketball will net you in the ballpark of 1,500 points, while the mundane journey from desk to water cooler will add about 10 to your tally. The idea, in essence, is to improve your heath by turning even the most common days into a kind of live-action video game: you set a goal — Rose and I both aim for 2,000 points a day — and then try to meet and beat it. Press a button on the side of the band and a slick L.E.D. screen lights up, telling you how much “fuel” you’ve accumulated at any given moment, as well as how many steps you’ve taken and how many calories you’ve burned. It is this button that Rose presses, proving, yes, she has outscored me. Again. Me: I’m starting to hate you. Rose: Hey, this was all your idea. Indeed it was. The FuelBands entered our lives as part of an experiment I decided to conduct in the name of self-betterment: a two-month immersion into the curious, ever-expanding world of gear and gadgets and socially networked apps designed to ensure that your body is operating at optimal frequency — and then broadcast that frequency to the world. The FuelBand has been paired with a mobile app that allows you to follow your FuelBand-wearing friends like you would on Twitter , with everyone’s results illuminated on a virtual scoreboard that appears on your phone. The sleek little scale made by Withings, a French company, that I weighed myself on not only delivered detailed analyses to an iPhone app, but it also shared the results to the Withings “community” — users who check each other’s stats on their smartphones, iPads or laptops. Meanwhile, during what were once casual bike rides around New York City , I wore a heart-rate monitor around my chest and had a little chip attached to my shoelaces — all part of Adidas ’s new miCoach line, which turns your smartphone into a computerized “coach” who (a) pushes you along with an electronic voice to make sure you’re getting the most out of workouts, while (b) keeping your Facebook friends updated on your accomplishments. Finally, come bedtime, I strapped a sensor-laden band called the Zeo Mobile Sleep Manager around my head to tell me how much light sleep, deep sleep and R.E.M. sleep I was getting, while allotting a “sleep score” that appeared on my phone in the mornings.

Especially to someone like me, who in general tends to write off exercise obsessives as belonging to an intellectually inferior subset of the population. It isn’t that I don’t care about being in stellar shape, about feeling good — I do. At least in theory. But do I care more about hamburgers and martinis? Without question. Until I stopped going to the gym recently, my intermittent workouts, if you can even call them that, typically lasted 10 minutes. Yet at 32 years old, I’ve been forced to recognize that my metabolism is no longer the all-devouring enigma it was in my 20s, and the fact of the matter — the fact of the waistline, you could say — was that a little tuneup wouldn’t hurt. In the end, I was curious to see if these gizmos, while appealing foremost to the gadget hound in me, would conspire to rewire my exercise-centric thoughts: instead of thinking, “This is tiring, I don’t like to be tired, I wouldn’t be tired if I stopped,” I would think, “I need the data, the points, the illusion of victory!”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       In fact, the makers of these gadgets understand that while a point system in itself may not get anyone’s heart racing , there is no motivation quite as effective as bragging rights. Keeping your heart rate up during workouts is important for the burning of calories, or so I’ve learned from the Adidas miCoach, yet for me it was really just another addition to the numbers game. I wanted my rate to be higher and higher simply because it was satisfying to see it on my phone. On bike rides, I began pushing myself, going faster and riding longer than ever before, happy to be seduced by the illusion that it all somehow mattered because it was being recorded. I felt like I was participating in a nonlethal “Hunger Games” competition, even when I was just running out to buy milk.

Not that it was easy. What my arsenal of gadgets initially made clear is that I live, like many modern Americans, a preposterously sedentary existence. As a writer, I spend most of my days at my computer, and since I work from home, my “commute” is limited to the 10 steps between my bed and desk. Rose, on the other hand, works as a stylist, constantly running around town to stores and photo shoots and, in the process, racking up a full tank of fuel. Monitoring her progress on my phone became an ever present and never pleasant reminder of my own inertia, and so I started going to extremes to rack up points. Take those moments after a long day when I typically crack open a beer and sit down with a magazine: now I got on my bike and reluctantly went for a ride. Coming home, I got in the habit of skipping the elevator in favor of the stairs, sprinting up the six flights to my apartment, only to realize at the top that I’d “forgotten” to check my mailbox, prompting another quick sprint. Oh wait — did I also “forget” to buy milk? Another jaunt to the deli, and suddenly I felt like one of those determined athletes in a montage from a feel-good sports movie, running up and down the stadium steps long after his teammates had called it a day. A few weeks in, you could say I was constantly exercising, looking for excuses to exercise, falling in love with exercise, becoming, in short, one of the very people I used to mock. But it never felt like that. What it felt like was an addictive game with stakes in the real world, the way Words With Friends can become too compulsive because you’re playing virtual words with your actual friends. The only difference, of course, is that as a result I was becoming a healthier human being.   Need proof? When I first stepped on the Withings scale, I had assumed that I weighed somewhere in the ballpark of 165 pounds, which is what I’ve weighed since I was 18. Wishful thinking. My initial weigh-in clocked me at a semi-alarming 175.5, forcing me to realize that, yes, my clothes had been fitting me a bit tighter for a reason. Watching what I eat has never been much of a skill of mine, but now that I was regularly consulting a graph charting my weight fluctuations, getting down to my modest target of 168 pounds became another little game. I took to drinking less beer and making chopped salads in order to see the line on the graph on my Withings app get lower and lower, splurging on fatty, more decadent fare only on days when I accumulated enough points to justify it. Ridiculous? No doubt about it. And yet as I write this, I’ve just stepped off the scale at a svelte 162 pounds, 13 pounds lighter than when this all began. And best of all, I even beat Rose. Rose: How many points? Me: 5,232! You? Rose: 3,928. Me: Ha! But she was still the more frequent victor; she even wishes that Nike would require some of the professional athletes it sponsors to wear the FuelBand and share the results. “Beating you is too easy,” she said. “I want to beat Lance Armstrong !”   A version of this article appears in print on September 9, 2012, on Page M274 of T Magazine with the headline: Sporting News.
