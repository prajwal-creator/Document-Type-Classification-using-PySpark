Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times     WHEN the tech firm Yipit moved last month from General Assembly, a communal office campus on 20th Street and Broadway, to its own loft space on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue, its 14 employees simply grabbed their coffee cups and MacBook Airs and did the job on foot. Arriving at their new home, they milled about, admiring the water-cooler, and the breath mints in the bathroom, and then got down to work, requiring no more than a power source and a pass code for the Wi-Fi. By the time the two guys from Moishe’s Moving Company arrived with a half-dozen boxes of office sundries, Yipit was back in business. There had already been a staff meeting, conducted while a handyman knelt in the rec room setting up a Ping-Pong table. All told, the move took about 10 minutes. With a recent $6 million Series-B (or second round) financing deal, and plans to double its workforce in a year, Yipit sits in the mid-to-low range of New York’s thriving tech spectrum, below the behemoths, like AOL and Twitter, and the happily mid-sized, like Foursquare and Gilt Groupe, but above the sort of start-ups that had been their neighbors at General Assembly’s shared tables. Its place in the world can be roughly inferred from the fact that one of Yipit’s founders, Vinicius Vacanti, recently bought an apartment downtown, outbidding — New York detail — Sarah Jessica Parker’s assistant. Standing recently in his new Silicon Alley office, with its new Xerox copier and new fridge stocked with Sierra Nevada beer, Mr. Vacanti was very much the young businessman, acknowledging, “It’s kind of like we were living with our parents for a while and now we’re on our own.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   According to city officials, high-tech employment in New York is, much like Yipit, on the move, shooting up by 30 percent in the last five years, at a time when overall private-sector employment has decreased. New York recently surpassed Boston in the amount of venture capital invested in Internet start-ups, and lags behind only San Francisco. The vibrant growth has led Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to campaign for a new graduate school of engineering to be built on Roosevelt Island and to the flourishing of a social scene so varied and complex that there are now techie fashion shows , techie reality TV shows , techie entrepreneurs on the Council of Foreign Relations, and techie scalpers hawking tickets outside the New York Tech Meetup , the industry’s premier (and perennially sold-out) monthly event. New York has become a hotbed of such expanding promise that one local company, GroupMe, was founded, developed and eventually sold to Skype for a reported $85 million — all within a year.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       It is often said that New York tech companies are not really tech companies in the chip-making Silicon Valley sense of the word, but merely use technology to deliver services in new ways. Yipit, which aggregates and filters daily deals from companies like Groupon and Living Social , delivering only those that subscribers want, fits that mold. It exemplifies what Roger Ehrenberg , a venture capitalist who invested in the company, once called “the kind of applied thinking that is very New York.” That approach would not have been possible in New York without the radical democratization of technology that has taken place over the last five years. Tools like hosted networks and open-source coding packages have allowed New Yorkers, who have historically left the hard-core engineering to their California peers, to establish themselves online cheaply and, in some cases, within days.

Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times    “From a technical perspective, it’s so much easier today to get your Web site or iPhone app running,” said Mr. Vacanti, who professes to have been a relative tech dummy when he started work on Yipit with his partner, Jim Moran. Mr. Moran himself claims that Yipit cut its start-up costs by as much as 90 percent by using pre-written software and by locating itself in the “cloud,” on a free server hosted by Amazon. In August, Mr. Vacanti, a former investment banker, published a blog post that attracted notice in New York’s chatty tech society. Entitled “Why I Quit My Job to Start a Tech Company,” it described how, late in 2006, while working at the Quadrangle Group, he attended a conference for media moguls and was stunned to find the middle-age executives paying tribute to two men in their 20s: Chad Hurley , co-founder of YouTube, and the sandal-wearing Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg . “I was floored,” Mr. Vacanti wrote. “They were building something. They were changing how the world communicated. What was I doing? Could I do what they had done?” Mr. Vacanti, 30, and Mr. Moran, 29, are part of a wave of New York entrepreneurs who have come to high-tech from high finance. (Mr. Moran once worked at the Blackstone Group.) The perceived demise of Wall Street as a sustainable — and desirable — career path has worked to tech’s advantage, pushing talented young people toward companies like Yipit, where half of the employees used to work for banks. “It just didn’t feel good when America started looking at Wall Street as the villain,” Mr. Vacanti recently said. “I mean, think about it. No one’s out there saying, ‘Occupy Tech Startups.’ ”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   MORE and more these days, New York entrepreneurs, attracted by the industry’s vitality and richness, are coming to the tech sector with little or no experience in technology and, in some cases, with only a vague notion of what they want to achieve. Yipit was born out of just this sort of amorphous desire. In 2007, at a time when the word “Tumblr” could still call to mind a circus act, Mr. Vacanti and Mr. Moran began to brainstorm plans for a company. They had saved a small stake from their Wall Street jobs and proceeded to consider, then discard, a variety of unworkable ideas. At one point, Yipit was going to sell furniture; at another, it was going to be a reservation service for New York nightclubs. There were brief iterations as a clearinghouse for sample sales and as a Twitter link shortener. Mr. Moran said of this period, “We were burning down our idea pretty much every other week.” Part of the problem, Mr. Vacanti said, was that the flow of information they were used to in finance — large-cap company market reports, equities analyses — had little relevance in the busy, fleeting, microcosmic world of technology. “The only way to succeed,” he said, “is to notice patterns of success, and then figure out a way to replicate the pattern where no one else has. Unless you’re deep in the start-up community, it’s very hard to come down one day and decide what’s going to work.”  Photo        James Moran, co-founder, and his staff moving, on foot, to their new office.   Credit Librado Romero/The New York Times    Even their corporate identity — their name, Yipit — was the product of a trial-and-error process, albeit one of a specifically digital sort. Mr. Moran said he and Mr. Vacanti had wanted a name with noun-like solidity but with the snappiness of a verb. “We wanted to be able to say, ‘Something-It!’ ” he said. The trouble was that neither man knew what that “something” was. So they created a computer program that generated all possible English-language compounds composed of a three-letter, consonant-vowel-consonant prefix and “it.” Yipit, Mr. Moran said, was the only one that was both pronounceable and unclaimed on the Internet’s domain registry. Last winter, having finally decided that Yipit would be an aggregator and sifter of daily deals, Mr. Vacanti and Mr. Moran moved into General Assembly, renting space in the “dedicated office” area, which is glassed off from the campus-like common room, with its propped-up cardboard cutout of Captain Kirk. General Assembly, the brainchild of four young techie locals, is something like the Deux Magots of the New York tech world: a place where kindred entrepreneurs, between stints of code-writing, can swap aperçus on location-based social gaming or search-engine optimization over fresh cups of gourmet Brazilian coffee.

A large daily deal company called one day, asking for information about the kinds of deals most popular with consumers. Because Yipit collects so many deals from so many sources and collates them according to its subscribers’ preferences, the company has a bird’s-eye view of the market. The caller was willing to pay for a glimpse. “We didn’t want to do it at first — it seemed like a distraction,” Mr. Vacanti said. “But now market research is a huge part of our business.” By focusing on services like this, instead of on hard technology, Yipit is of a piece with New York tech-boom companies of the 1990s, like Doubleclick and Razorfish. Those two online advertising agencies prospered because the advertising industry and its large creative class were already here, and they survived the bust of Internet 1.0 to witness and fertilize the second boom. “The most important thing a tech ecosystem can have is the first-growth forest underneath to produce the second growth,” said David S. Rose, a longtime New York angel investor who now runs a company called Gust. “New York didn’t have that until after the post-dotcom nuclear winter of 2001 to 2003.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It is no surprise that the new boom has coincided with the reign of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is thought of fondly in local tech circles as the city’s oldest start-up guy. Mr. Bloomberg made his first appearance at the Tech Meetup last month, waxing nostalgic about soldering capacitors in his early days at Bloomberg L.P. Although the word “capacitors” drew blank stares from the iPad -toting crowd, the mayor was a hit. He was honored with an unusually long 30-minute speaking slot — which he promptly overran — and with a standing ovation. ONE night in October, Mr. Vacanti went to watch his soccer team, Soccer 3.1, play on a field in Chinatown. Soccer 3.1 is an all-tech squad. The goalkeeper is a developer for Hashable , which helps manage online relationships. One of the forwards works for Greycroft Partners , the investment firm run by Alan Patricof, a longtime venture capitalist. Mr. Vacanti, with an injured foot in an orthopedic boot, squirmed in the darkness on the sidelines. “It’s killing me not being out there,” he said.

Credit Benjamin Norman for The New York Times    Because of its density and overwhelming youthfulness, Silicon Alley is a subculture as much as it is an industry, and on any given night, postings can be found online for events that range from a happy hour for programming nerds to a live-streamed panel discussion on venture capitalism hosted by Girls in Tech NYC. Last month, Matthew Cavnar, an executive at the e-book company Vook , was hanging out at General Assembly when the news broke that Steve Jobs had died. “Everybody there was my age or younger,” said Mr. Cavnar, 33. “Everyone was doing their demos and everyone just stopped. There was this long conversation about Steve Jobs. It turned into this experience where you were with your peers, on a Wednesday night, excited at 9 o’clock to be talking about technology.” For an industry that in the second quarter of this year alone witnessed more than 40 start-up deals valued at nearly $400 million, New York’s tech world projects an aggressively noncorporate public face. Dennis Crowley, a co-founder of Foursquare, recently told an interviewer that he was more interested in building new products than in “monetization.” There is a correlative belief that entrepreneurs and engineers in New York are more like artists than capitalists. “People here are craftspeople,” said Adam Pritzker , one of the founders of General Assembly. “What this movement is doing is showing people that they aren’t cogs in a larger bureaucracy. It’s reconnecting them with things they make themselves, with craft.” It is certainly a happy accident that Silicon Alley has located itself in what could be called the “ Restoration Hardware district,” a corridor of high-end tool shops and antique-furniture purveyors in the Flatiron neighborhood, where seekers can always find a handmade armoire or a 19th-century awl. The name “General Assembly,” as Mr. Pritzker said, was chosen to reflect an interest in this sort of small-bore, artisanal production. On the night of Yipit’s big move, General Assembly threw Mr. Vacanti and Mr. Moran a “graduation” party. There were heartfelt speeches about “mutual support” and “reciprocal relationships” and the necessity of finally “leaving the nest.” The founders received a gift bottle of single-malt scotch. As the digerati stood about, drinking beers from a metal ice bucket, one of them asked Mr. Moran if he had ever felt like giving up. Mr. Moran thought deeply on the subject. Eventually he said that he had, but that the idea of avoiding a return to Wall Street had always managed to sustain him.

He is Vinicius Vacanti, not Vincent Vacante.
