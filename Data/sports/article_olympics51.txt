Eisenhower, George S. Patton and Omar N. Bradley, the three outstanding American commanders in North Africa and Europe from 1942 to 1945, were, if not exactly “brothers in arms,” at least friends, even if their friendship was often disrupted by envy, backbiting and disagreements over strategy. Fellow graduates of the United States Military Academy, all three were immensely ambitious. Eisenhower and Bradley were impervious to the outward trappings of military glory and took little or no pleasure in warfare. Patton, on the other hand, operated at a higher and more brittle emotional level. He undercut “Ike” and “Brad” whenever he could, yet was just as likely to be swept away on a wave of sentimentality about them when his mood changed. He clearly suffered from bipolar disorder, though the condition wasn’t recognized at the time, and one of the real pleasures of Jonathan W. Jordan’s “Brothers, Rivals, Victors” is reading about this Peck’s Bad Boy of the American military. Jordan, a military historian, begins his story in the immediate aftermath of World War I, when Eisenhower and Patton formed a close if unlikely friendship. Patton was rich, well connected, a cavalryman and a dashing polo player who had competed in the Olympics and won a chestful of decorations for bravery on the Western Front. Eisenhower was of humble origin but so skilled at staff work and training troops that the War Department had refused to send him to France. The two men were drawn together both by an admiration for each other’s professional ability and by a mutual enthusiasm for the tank as the weapon of the future. Bradley, sidetracked like Eisenhower, never managed to get nearer to the war than Montana, where he commanded an infantry company being used to break up strikes. But together, these three very different men — each more or less handpicked by Gen. George C. Marshall, perhaps the best talent scout the United States Army has ever possessed — went on to form a partnership under Eisenhower’s command that was extraordinarily effective on the battlefield. This is not really a work of military history. Readers who want a rounded description of the war in Europe should look elsewhere. What Jordan gives us is the war as Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton saw it.

At his worst, Jordan can sound parochial: he dismisses Gen. Charles de Gaulle as a “Gallic peacock,” and takes pretty much the same view of Montgomery. World War II in Europe was won by that rarest of arrangements, a successful coalition, thanks in large measure to the patient, fair-minded genius of Eisenhower as supreme commander, and to his determination to enforce equality between the American and British troops, despite a vast gulf of differences. You will not learn that from this book.  Photo        Fighting generals: Eisenhower, Patton and Bradley in Germany in 1945.   Credit Corbis    Where Jordan does excel is in his diligent use of quotations to capture exactly what the three men thought of one another, and to show how each went out of his way to strike the image of a “fighting general.” Patton, of course, was a master showman, who always managed to project himself as the fighting general. Eisenhower disliked Patton’s ivory-handled revolvers, and in later years he firmly discouraged Patton worship. Eisenhower also disapproved of Bradley’s ostentatious pose of wearing a G. I.’s combat blouse and boots, but, as Jordan points out, Bradley “was, in Ike’s opinion, the greatest American ground commander in recent memory.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       His judgment of Patton was more cautious. Jordan quotes a letter from Eisenhower to one of the producers of the movie “Patton,” which pretty well sums up his opinion of his two most famous army commanders: Patton’s “temperament made him a headliner in the press, but he was not the kind of all-around, balanced, competent and effective commander that Bradley was. . . . He disliked, intensively, the heavy fighting necessary to break through, and because of this I did not use him in the slugging match that finally brought about the breakout from the beachhead, in late July 1944. Once, however, we had broken through, he was a natural to put in for exploiting the weaknesses of the Nazi forces on our right flank.” Patton did not survive to write retrospectively, but despite their friendship, he raged in his diary that “Ike is more British than the British and is putty in their hands.” (He was critical, as well, of Eisenhower’s relationship with his beautiful young British driver, Kay Summersby.) Patton was no kinder to Bradley behind his back. In a letter to his wife, Beatrice, he called Bradley “the tent maker” — a snide reference to his first name. Given such sentiments, it may seem surprising that we managed to win the war at all. Fortunately the German field marshals’ feelings toward one another were not noticeably more generous — Rommel’s colleagues, for example, referred to him scornfully as the Bubi-Marschall (baby marshal).

Jordan’s three subjects are all too human. And yet, in the end, they somehow got it right, and managed to deploy America’s strength on the battlefield in a way that not only defeated, but destroyed, an army that was in some respects better equipped, better trained, undoubtedly more battle-hardened and, until the very end, motivated by a degree of fanaticism that went beyond mere dedication to country. It is not just that Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton knew what they were doing; they represented America’s traditional way of waging and winning wars. Eisenhower, like Ulysses S. Grant, his model as a general, was a man who understood the importance of bringing America’s full resources to bear on the enemy. Bradley, like George Meade, was a superb planner and organizer of armies, as well as a dogged fighter. Patton, like J. E. B. Stuart, was a master of the rapid advance and unexpected flanking attack. They were perhaps the last American generals who enjoyed the full confidence of the government, the public and their own troops (despite Patton’s singular talent for saying and doing the wrong thing), and they may have been the last who believed that when America fought, it should be in pursuit of a clearly defined goal and a complete ­victory. To read about Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton today is to imagine how dismayed and angry they would be to see small packets of American troops spread out over a hostile landscape, defending themselves against endless attacks by an enemy that vanishes when pursued, in a war in which American speed, mobility and firepower count for nothing, and where nobody has as yet defined what “victory” would look like. In World War II, the generals understood what victory would look like, and knew how to achieve it. It’s almost enough to make one nostalgic for that war, as opposed to the mess we’re in now.
