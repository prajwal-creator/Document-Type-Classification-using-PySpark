Credit Ivan Sekretarev/Associated Press     MOSCOW —  Russia’s readiness to serve as the host of major international sporting events like the Olympics and the World Cup faced new criticism after a top player from Africa said he had been racially abused by fans during a Champions League soccer match here Wednesday. A few minutes into the second half of the match, between Manchester City and CSKA Moscow, Yaya Touré, a star midfielder for City from Ivory Coast, walked up to the referee, Ovidiu Hategan, and angrily pointed at CSKA fans making monkey chants and shouting abuse toward him and his black teammates. The game continued and, according to Touré, so did the abuse. Afterward, Touré, who plays internationally for Ivory Coast, said that unless Russia took steps to stop racist abuse by its fans, black players might boycott the World Cup when the country hosts the tournament in 2018. “If we are not confident coming to the World Cup in Russia, we don’t come,” Touré said. European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, has opened an investigation into the accusation of abuse, and the incident has created another storm of negative publicity. For the second time in a year, Russia has found that efforts to showcase itself through sports have inadvertently exposed social attitudes held by many of its citizens. The country is already trying to fend off concerns about the safety of gay athletes and visitors to the Winter Olympics in February in Sochi, after it passed a law banning “gay propaganda.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Touré’s complaint has shifted the focus to racism in Russian soccer. Last December, another Russian club, Zenit St. Petersburg, received a petition from its largest fan group demanding that the club exclude black players. Insults and monkey noises directed at players by fans are not uncommon. In 2011, while playing for Anzhi Makhachkala, the Brazilian Roberto Carlos stormed off the field after a fan threw a banana at him. Months earlier, a Zenit fan offered him a banana through a stadium fence.

Its three-step protocol calls for any match in which such behavior occurs to be halted and for a warning to be issued over the stadium loudspeakers when the referee is made aware of the problem. Hategan, however, did not stop Wednesday’s match. “I’m not surprised by what happened,” Alexander Verkhovsky, the director of the Russian anti-racism research organization SOVA. “Here it’s rather common to chant something racist.” Part of the furor resulted from CSKA’s adamant denial that any abuse had taken place. In a statement, the club said that Touré had misheard boos directed at all of the City players, regardless of their race, and said CSKA was puzzled “why the Ivorian midfielder of Manchester City took it all personally.” CSKA repeated its denials after UEFA announced its inquiry Thursday. “Nothing has changed since yesterday,” Michael Sanadze, the deputy media manager for CSKA, said in a telephone interview. The incident is also embarrassing for UEFA, as it took place during a week when the organization was promoting a new campaign called No To Racism . (The slogan was printed on Touré’s captain’s armband for the match, and he could be seen pointing that out to Hategan, the referee, while voicing his complaints.) Michel Platini, UEFA’s president, ordered on Friday that a separate investigation be opened into why the referee did not halt play after Touré’s complaint. Russia has previously been criticized for failing to adequately penalize teams for racist incidents. By May of this year, Zenit had already been fined $170,000 for misbehavior by its fans. Kommersant, a business daily, keeps a scorecard for the fines racked up by CSKA and Spartak fans in their local derby. In a rare case, CSKA was ordered to play a game in an empty stadium last November as punishment after one of its fans threw a flare that struck an opposing player.

Verkhovsky, of the anti-racism organization, said there was little will among Russian sports institutions to combat prejudice among fans. “Russian authorities have a very high tolerance to racism,” he said. Russian’s soccer federation denied that the country had a problem with racism in the stands. “The situation is no worse than in other countries in the world,” said Nikita P. Simonyan, first vice president of the Russian Football Union. “I’m sure that we’re improving the situation.” Black players who have played in Russian leagues and human-rights groups specializing in racism disagreed, calling racist abuse a fact of life in the country’s stadiums.

Kulaeva, who runs ADC Memorial, an organization that promotes immigrants’ rights in Russia, said that although the atmosphere at soccer matches was not as bad as it had been, racist views were still a fundamental part of the culture. Kulaeva said that racist attitudes had become more strident among a majority of the Russian population in recent years, citing an Oct. 13 anti-immigrant riot in southern Moscow involving thousands of white youths. Preparations for the World Cup here have already begun, with $7.5 billion budgeted to get Russia’s stadiums ready. The game on Wednesday was played at Moscow’s Khimki arena because CSKA’s larger home stadium, an important site for the tournament, is being renovated. Russian World Cup organizers hurriedly sought to pledge that they were taking racism seriously. The committee went on to suggest that the World Cup could provide an impetus for improvement, saying in a statement that the 2018 event could “act as catalyst to positively change the mind-sets and behaviors across all involved in Russian football.” Doubts remain about how realistic that vision is, and Verkhovsky and Kulaeva noted that little had changed when it came to fan behavior in recent years. “There’s been so many of these cases,” Verkhovsky said. Sanadze, CSKA’s deputy media manager, reiterated his club’s position, saying, “We — and tens of thousands of fans in the stadium — didn’t hear anything.”   A version of this article appears in print on October 26, 2013, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Accusations of Racism Haunting Russia.
