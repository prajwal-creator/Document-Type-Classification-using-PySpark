David Boies , the prominent lawyer who just months ago defended the N.F.L. during its lockout, has switched sides and will now represent the N.B.A. players in their fight against the league’s lockout. Working both sides of an argument is not unique for lawyers, especially one as successful as Mr. Boies. Indeed, he defended I.B.M. against antitrust charges and prosecuted Microsoft on antitrust charges on the government’s behalf. When he represented Al Gore before the Supreme Court in the case that decided the 2000 presidential election, he squared off against Theodore B. Olson. He then teamed with Mr. Olson to fight the same-sex marriage ban in California known as Proposition 8. Mr. Boies also has plenty of experience in sports, having advised the Yankees, Nascar and Larry Ellison in his dispute involving the America’s Cup. What is unusual this time is how quickly Mr. Boies has moved to the other side of the aisle. Last spring, he helped the N.F.L. block the union’s legal challenges, which ultimately led the players to return to the negotiating table and agree to a new collective bargaining agreement with no loss of regular-season games.

Players Association and counsels the National Basketball Players Association as well.

The law tends to be the law. How you apply the law sometimes varies, and what the facts are that determine the applicability of the law are critical.” The N.F.L. and N.B.A. unions disbanded, but there are several differences in their cases. The N.F.L. players union, for instance, disbanded several hours before the lockout began in March. The basketball players, by contrast, have disbanded four months after the lockout began, and after the league gave the players ultimatums. To the N.B.A., the differences in the approaches taken by the N.F.L. and N.B.A. players are without a distinction. On Monday, the league amended the unfair labor practice charge that it filed with National Labor Relations Board in August. Since then, the league contends, the union has “failed to bargain in good faith” and threatened to decertify or disclaim interest in further representing the players.

The N.L.R.B. is reviewing the matter but has no timetable for issuing a complaint or dismissing the charge, said Nancy Cleeland, a spokeswoman for the board. In the meantime, Mr. Boies and Mr. Kessler will proceed in court to charge that the N.B.A. has violated antitrust laws. But many antitrust suits are made to be settled, said Jeffrey Standen, who teaches sports law at Willamette University, because the cases are expensive and time-consuming. “It will take several years, so I suspect this is another tool in the arsenal for the players to slightly up the ante on the owners,” he said. Even then, the players could end up accepting the last deal the owners offered before they decided to disband, or worse, other legal experts said. “It could a Pyrrhic victory,” said Mark Conrad, the chairman of legal and ethical studies at Fordham. “It could set back the sport for a long time. The litigation strategy is wonderful for the lawyers, but the public is going to be angry.”   Howard Beck contributed reporting.
