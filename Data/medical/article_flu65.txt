He dashed off E-mails to the scientists studying the patient and then phoned his research associates, saying, ''You won't believe what I just heard.'' Word of the unusual German case quickly spread to a support group for patients in one of Dr. Walker's clinical trials at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Since then the group has had an extra, invisible member: the Berlin patient, who is discussed and analyzed almost as if he were actually present. ''I've never met him, and I don't even know his name, but I've followed his case,'' says one member of the group. ''He is what we want to be.'' The source of all this excitement is a young German man who became infected with the AIDS virus just over two years ago and quickly started taking a combination of anti-H.I.V. drugs. After just six months of therapy, however, he ignored the advice of his doctor and stopped taking the drugs. When that happens, the virus ordinarily comes roaring back, resuming its advance to full-blown AIDS. What makes the Berlin patient so intriguing is that his virus hasn't come back. The most precise tests detect no H.I.V. in his blood and only trace amounts in his lymph tissue, the major reservoir for the virus. He harbors so little H.I.V. that in order to detect it in one of its hiding places, Dr. Robert Siliciano, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, had to redesign his assay, making it five times as sensitive. What little virus remains in the patient is fully capable of reigniting an infection, so he is not cured. But his immune system is apparently suppressing H.I.V. without drugs. He has not taken an AIDS pill in a year and a half. The Berlin patient fascinates researchers, who hope that clues to this singular case may lead to new treatments, especially for those patients lucky enough to get an early diagnosis. At the same time, researchers are terrified that news of his case might encourage other patients to abandon their drugs, a rash decision that virtually always frees the virus to continue its destruction of the immune system and, possibly, mutate into drug-resistant strains. Indeed, another patient in Berlin -- infected at nearly the same time and treated by the same doctor with the same drugs -- similarly stopped taking his pills. Immediately, his virus reared up. The overwhelming majority of AIDS doctors agree with Marcus Conant, a veteran AIDS doctor in San Francisco, who says, ''If someone comes to me and says, 'I want to go off drugs,' I look him in the eye and say, 'You're nuts.'''

At the last international AIDS conference, held two years ago in Vancouver, Dr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York, projected a slogan onto the screen that could have been a motto for H.I.V. research at the time: ''It's the virus!'' And, indeed, targeting the virus has led to a class of antiviral drugs known as protease inhibitors, the primary force behind a remarkable two-year decline in AIDS death rates.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       No one is suggesting a retreat from this front, but as 10,000 researchers, doctors and advocates gather in Geneva next week for the 12th World AIDS Conference, the research focus is broadening from simply attacking the virus to strengthening the immune system as well. The Berlin patient, along with several similar, but less well documented cases just now coming to light, are helping to spur this shift. Such cases are ''really pivotal for how we think about H.I.V.,'' says Walker, an immunologist who obtained and analyzed the Berlin patient's blood. ''What they're banging us over the head with is that the immune system can control this virus.'' The renewed interest in the immune system comes at a time when AIDS research has reached a plateau following the development of protease inhibitors. Despite a Presidential commitment to create a vaccine, and despite the recent approval by the F.D.A. to begin large-scale testing of one experimental vaccine, there is widespread sentiment that vaccine research lags behind drug development. Meanwhile, an estimated 16,000 people are infected with H.I.V. every day, and 90 percent of them live in developing nations that can't afford the expensive new medications. At the same time, early euphoria over protease inhibitors has been tempered by the realization that they achieve a stalemate, not a victory. Cocktails of two to four drugs can stop H.I.V. from replicating and halt disease progression but can't eliminate the virus, because it integrates into the DNA of every cell it infects. Scientists hoped that if H.I.V. were paralyzed long enough, the body might purge every infected cell. But that possibility dimmed last year when three independent research teams found that H.I.V. can hide indefinitely in long-lived cells known as resting T cells. So unless new strategies are developed, patients might have to take their drugs for life. But the drugs can cause persistent nausea and diarrhea, and frightening long-term side effects have recently been emerging, including redistribution of body fat and possible heart complications. Moreover, the drugs currently fail to suppress H.I.V. in as many as a third of all patients, and that proportion may grow over time. When drugs fail, it often means that the virus has mutated into a strain that is resistant to many drugs, even ones the patient has never taken, leaving few or no options for effective therapy. ''We could be on a short-term euphoria,'' warns Dr. Ronald Desrosiers of Harvard. If toxicities or drug resistance forces enough patients off medication, he says, the two-year decline in the AIDS death rate could prove short-lived. ''Ten years from now,'' Desrosiers says, ''we could be back to where we were five years ago.'' Yet despite their limitations, the drugs do pin down the virus, at least for a while, thus providing a window of opportunity for researchers to revive the overwhelmed immune system. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (N.I.A.I.D.) in Bethesda, Md., says that it might not be necessary to decrease the viral level to zero. ''You may just need to get it low enough so that the immune system can kick in and keep it in check,'' he says. Ho agrees: ''Control without eradication might be something we could call remission.'' That's why the Berlin patient, who seems to fit precisely this description, is so exciting to researchers. ''What we're looking for,'' Walker says, ''are clues, experiments of nature that will allow us to understand how to tweak the immune system so that it can control the virus. And it's patients like this guy in Berlin who will give us those insights.'' At 30, he is still a student, and he dresses like one: jeans, a plaid shirt open at the neck and, on his wrist, one of those colorful cloth bracelets from Mexico. He has short, alfalfa hair and eyes that often look away, for he is almost painfully shy. He has never before spoken publicly about his situation, and -- fearful of discrimination against both himself and his parents, who still live in a small town in southern Germany -- he agreed to talk only if his identity were concealed.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   I met the Berlin patient in his doctor's office, and we walked a few blocks through the heart of West Berlin's gay neighborhood to a cafe, where he explained how he became a celebrated medical mystery. It began on May 10, 1996, when he had sex that wasn't safe. Three weeks later, he came down with what is called primary infection syndrome, the fever, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue signaling that H.I.V. is gaining an initial foothold. Heiko Jessen, a Berlin doctor with a large AIDS practice, suggested an H.I.V. test. On June 20, Jessen delivered the bad news. ''I could not move,'' recalls the Berlin patient. ''I didn't even cry.'' Ten days later, the Berlin patient started on a cocktail of three drugs -- the protease inhibitor indinavir, ddI and an experimental and controversial drug called hydroxyurea. The amount of virus in his blood quickly plummeted. Then, less than three weeks after starting his medication, he developed a testicular infection requiring an emergency hospitalization. But he hadn't taken his H.I.V. pills with him. So for several days he didn't take his medicine, and his virus popped back, though only to low levels. Restarting the drugs squelched it. After that the Berlin patient took his pills religiously until, about four months later, he started feeling weak and eating began to make him vomit. He had contracted hepatitis A, which forced him to interrupt his medication again. When he recovered two weeks later, Jessen advised him to resume taking his H.I.V. drugs. Curiously, the virus didn't come back as it had during his testicular infection. But it wasn't the lab tests that ultimately persuaded the Berlin patient to take the dangerous step of ending his drug regimen. ''When the hepatitis stopped,'' he says, leaning forward, ''I felt so healthy. I remember especially one evening. I was listening to some music, and it was really, really cold -- it was November -- but I opened the windows and I was breathing and I thought: 'My body, it's O.K. Everything's fine.''' After that he took his pills only half-heartedly. ''One day I took all of them,'' he laughs, ''and the next day it was only two, and some days I really took nothing.'' Jessen calls his patient a ''dream boy.'' Indeed, he relies on intuition and feeling more than logic and fact. And before becoming infected, he had never known anyone with H.I.V., and no one close to him had ever died. So he is totally sincere when he says he was ''not so surprised'' that his virus didn't come back, because ''it was almost my will to become healthy.'' With 400 AIDS patients under his care, Jessen couldn't afford to be so naive. When the Berlin patient admitted, just before Christmas 1996, that he wasn't taking his medicine regularly, Jessen told him, ''This is not a good idea.'' Jessen tried to bargain, proposing that his patient postpone his decision for a few more months. ''But he said he had definitely decided,'' Jessen remembers with resignation. ''What could I do?'' Yet Jessen realized that something fascinating was happening in his patient. The virus should have already come back. Indeed, a concurrent infection like hepatitis normally stirs up H.I.V. So Jessen said: ''You must come at least twice a month to the office. You owe me that.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The Berlin patient has certainly fulfilled his debt to science, according to Dr. Franco Lori, the principal scientist working on his case and director of the Research Institute for Genetic and Human Therapy in Washington and Pavia, Italy. Lori once joked that the reason the Berlin patient has virtually no virus left is that researchers have removed it all by drawing so much blood. Yet he feels no larger debt, no new lease on life. ''I really did not suffer,'' he says. ''Only the pills reminded me I was ill.'' Lori first presented the Berlin patient's case at a September 1997 conference organized by the lab of Dr. Robert Gallo, co-discoverer of H.I.V. Two similar cases had already been reported in the British medical journal The Lancet, but many researchers doubted those cases. The lead scientist -- Dr. Jorge Vila, medical director at the French drug company Compagnie de Developpement Aguettant in Lyons -- isn't well known to AIDS researchers. And Vila's two patients had such small amounts of virus in their blood before starting therapy that scientists even speculated that they might not have been infected at all. (The Berlin patient had a substantial infection, verified by two separate tests.)  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

David Ho revealed in an interview that he is following two patients who, like the Berlin patient, started treatment soon after they were infected and then decided to stop therapy against medical advice. Their virus, Ho says, has not returned ''in a detectable way with traditional tests.'' He declined to give additional details until he has studied them in more depth. And Vila now says that he has eight additional patients who have had no detectable H.I.V. rebound 3 to 12 months after stopping their medication. One was treated early, but the others are what are known as A1 patients, meaning they have suffered no AIDS symptoms and retain relatively strong immune systems. All of them started therapy with blood tests showing H.I.V. counts of less than 10,000, a low number. None of these 10 new cases have been formally presented in scientific conferences or journals. But if they hold up, there could be 13 patients who are suppressing H.I.V. after stopping treatment. ''That's not a trend,'' says Dr. Beatrice Hahn, a University of Alabama AIDS researcher, ''but it's more than an anecdote. These are some of the most important patients to study.'' The Berlin patient is the best documented of all, and clinical trials are about to begin that, in essence, try to repeat certain key elements of his case. Bruce Walker was eager to get the Berlin patient's blood because he had developed a theory that predicted cases exactly like his. Engaging and confident, Walker spoke with me in what seemed to be the only quiet spot in Massachusetts General Hospital that afternoon: the old operating theater, a rooftop rotunda that is white, austere and as simple as his theory. ''The problem with H.I.V.,'' Walker says, his voice dissipating into the rotunda, ''is that it's an infection of the immune system.'' The conductor of the immune system is the helper T cell, so named because it helps the two main arms of the body's defense system. The immune system has billions of helper cells, and each one is genetically programmed to recognize one and only one germ. A helper cell that recognizes the flu virus, for example, will blithely pass by the virus that causes hepatitis. But when a helper cell comes in contact with its germ, says Dr. H. Clifford Lane, an AIDS researcher at the N.I.A.I.D., ''it sort of says, 'Oh, my God, I've waited my whole life for this moment,' and it immediately starts dividing.'' The activated cell multiplies until millions of its progeny are circulating through the blood. These cells help by sending out chemical signals to B cells, which produce the antibodies that snare freely circulating virus, and to the killer T cells, which kill off any cell in which the virus is hiding. Many researchers, including Walker and Hahn, believe killer T cells are capable of keeping H.I.V. in check -- but only if the helper cells are there to give them orders. H.I.V., however, infects helper T cells, especially those that are dividing. So when helper cells that recognize H.I.V. go on red alert and start dividing, they simply provide more fodder for the virus. The helper cells can never multiply to the number needed to orchestrate a full and effective immune response, because the virus is picking them off. Within 12 months, H.I.V. is believed to wipe out the vast majority of the body's H.I.V.-specific T cells. But scientists have known for some time about a small group of people they call long-term nonprogressors, who suppress the virus without ever taking drugs. They often have extremely large numbers of H.I.V.-specific helper T cells, which may explain why their immune systems keep the virus in check. Walker and his colleague Dr. Eric Rosenberg found that if H.I.V. is pinned down with aggressive drug treatment soon after infection, ordinary patients develop H.I.V.-specific-helper-cell responses indistinguishable from those in long-term nonprogressors. When Walker and Rosenberg first published these results last year in Science, researchers were heartened because of the obvious implication: early, aggressive treatment might transform ordinary patients into long-term nonprogressors who don't need drugs to contain H.I.V. And that's what Walker thinks probably happened with the Berlin patient. This theory has yet to be tested, and some people in the field think it's too good to be true. ''You either have the right genes or you don't,'' says Dr. Steven Miles, an associate professor of medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles. He points to another case, reported in Annals of Internal Medicine last month, in which a patient was treated soon after being infected. Six months later he went off therapy and went through the symptoms of primary infection, suggesting that early intervention merely delayed, but did not alter, the course of his disease.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Still, many major researchers think Walker's theory is plausible and want to see it tested. It's so logical, ''you might have expected it from first principles,'' says Dr. William Paul, chief of the N.I.A.I.D. Laboratory of Immunology and former director of the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health. ''I've totally bought into Bruce Walker's hypothesis,'' says Desrosiers of Harvard, who studies how AIDS vaccines stimulate immunity. Even Robert Gallo, who has doubts about parts of Walker's theory, says, ''Bruce has got the only data I know of that say early, hard therapy is doing anything good.'' The only way to test any theory that suggests patients can do without their drugs is, of course, to stop the drugs and see what happens. Doing so is controversial, but some fears have diminished. While there is still a strong consensus against letting patients go off their medicine by themselves, there is a growing sense that with very careful scientific monitoring the danger might be tolerable. There are clinical reports of patients being able to recommence therapy and suppress the virus, just as the Berlin patient did after his testicular infection. So if, under careful observation, Walker's theory failed and the virus popped back, doctors could immediately restart medication. ''I don't think the damage would be severe,'' Paul says. ''But of course I could be wrong, and it's someone else's life.'' If the immunologists are right, then lab tests of the lucky patients who have stopped therapy without rebound should show a potent helper-T-cell response. Vila and Ho haven't finished testing their patients, but Walker has tested the Berlin patient. During a lecture in February, he accidentally displayed results with an identifiable reference to the Berlin patient. That first round of tests indicated that he does indeed have potent H.I.V.-specific helper responses. ''You weren't supposed to notice that,'' Walker sighs. ''We have not retested. What if we're wrong?'' He hopes to release follow-up tests at the AIDS conference next week. Having a lab test that could help predict which patients might do well without medication would be a boon to the trials that Walker and others are eager to start. Walker's hypothesis is hardly the only one. another theory involves hydroxyurea, the experimental drug taken by the Berlin patient and by Vila's 10 patients. Used for 35 years against certain cancers, hydroxyurea does not target H.I.V. itself but rather the cells that H.I.V. infects. Its main effect seems to be to boost the power of some AIDS medications like ddI, and it also keeps immune-system cells from dividing. Vila's company is testing hydroxyurea, and Franco Lori is a longtime proponent, but many other researchers agree that use of the drug might explain why the virus didn't come back. ''I don't think so,'' Ho counters. The two patients he is following never took hydroxyurea, which strongly suggests that the drug isn't required for such success. But Vila's and Lori's unusual cases have reinvigorated interest in the drug, and several new trials are being planned, including one by the prominent virologist Dr. Douglas Richman of the University of California at San Diego. The Berlin patient's unpleasant testicular episode suggests another possible treatment strategy. Sometimes the immune system needs prolonged or repeated exposures to a germ before it develops a full, robust response. (That's why many vaccines require booster shots.) When the Berlin patient was hospitalized for his testicular infection, his short interruption of therapy allowed H.I.V. to come back and circulate in his body. Could that have acted as a kind of booster shot, priming his immune system for the moment he went off medication for good? ''That's one of the hypotheses we wish to test,'' Ho says -- but not, he is quick to add, by interrupting medication. Instead, both he and Walker are planning trials in which they will inject patients on therapy with an H.I.V. vaccine to see if it stimulates a strong immune response. Of course, there are many other possible explanations. Maybe some of these patients have a defective strain of H.I.V., and maybe the rest will turn out to be flukes. Finally, these patients might simply be long-term nonprogressors, who would never have needed drugs to suppress the virus. ''So,'' Ho wonders, ''is it anything we've done?''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Even if early treatment can train the immune system to handle H.I.V. on its own, ''I really wonder how relevant this will be,'' says Dr. Steven Deeks, a researcher at San Francisco General Hospital. ''It's very hard to identify people that early during infection.'' In the short term, only a tiny fraction of patients -- well educated, with access to good medical care -- stand to benefit. But long term, ''the implications are much broader,'' says Dr. Michael Lederman, an immunologist at Case Western Reserve University. Even if the immune system proves unable to supplant H.I.V. medications on its own, it might be mobilized to complement the drugs. It is known that people treated early respond better than people treated after the virus has wreaked its damage. Strengthening the immune system, therefore, might be like adding a drug to the cocktail. Certain experimental vaccines, like the one developed by the late Jonas Salk, can stimulate H.I.V.-specific responses. Walker will soon be testing the Salk vaccine, and a 2,500-patient trial is already under way. The goal: to see if it improves the effectiveness of existing H.I.V. medicines. That is also the idea behind a strategy from the far edges of biology: gene therapy. Several researchers, including Lori's colleague Julianna Lisziewicz, have spliced genes into cells, which might make them invulnerable to infection. Thus protected, H.I.V.-specific helper T cells could survive viral attack and orchestrate the rest of the immune response. Dr. Philip Greenberg at the University of Washington plans to test that strategy by isolating the few surviving H.I.V.-specific helper T cells in patients, growing billions of genetically modified copies in the lab and reinfusing these ''protected'' cells. Such a therapy might benefit a larger population. As it stands, the Berlin patient's luck is still unexplained -- and still provisional. ''I don't think the virus will come back,'' he says. ''We have a German phrase for my situation, uber den Berg,'' over the hump. ''It's finished for me.'' Perhaps. But he must continue practicing safe sex, because he might still be infectious, and he went to his first H.I.V. support group only after he had stopped taking drugs and had suppressed the virus. ''Once you are H.I.V.-positive,'' he explains, less naive now, ''the virus is always in you.''   Mark Schoofs is a staff writer and columnist for The Village Voice.
