But on Wednesday evening, thousands of soccer fans headed for the edge of the Queens park — not to play, but to watch an exhibition game between Ecuador and Chile. Citi Field, the baseball stadium that is the home of the Mets, was flooded with the braying of vuvuzelas, and by fans decked in their team’s colors — jerseys, face paint and even some patriotically colored Mohawk-style wigs — and some with their country’s flag worn like a superhero’s cape. The scene offered a preview of sorts for what officials at Major League Soccer hope will soon be the home to a new stadium for the league’s 20th team. After considering locations around the city — including Pier 40 on the West Side in Manhattan, the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx and land in Greenpoint, Brooklyn — the league has zeroed in on the park and is negotiating with Queens, city and state officials to secure the land and the necessary approvals.

Blue for The New York Times    “I have been thinking about it for a long, long time: Why don’t they do a stadium?” said William Orellana, 35, a restaurant manager who came from Manhattan for Wednesday’s match. “It will be awesome because there are a lot of Latin people in this area, and everybody loves soccer.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The new stadium would hold about 25,000 spectators, according to a proposal presented by Mark Abbott, the league’s president, to Queens elected officials in late June. League officials highlighted plans to also build municipal soccer fields, cricket fields and volleyball courts on the site. They also estimated that construction would create more than 2,000 temporary jobs and 300 permanent jobs, said Dan Andrews, the spokesman for the Queens borough president, Helen M. Marshall, who attended the presentation. The proposed team does not yet have a name or an owner. The project already has support from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who called it “a very big deal” at a news conference on Monday. Lawrence S. Schwartz, an aide to Mr. Cuomo, said, “If all the parties work together and want it to happen, it can happen in 2013.” Risa B. Heller, a spokeswoman for Major League Soccer, which began play in 1996, confirmed it was in negotiations about the stadium but declined to respond to specific questions about the plans, including the timing. The league’s commissioner, Don Garber, a Queens native, has long said the league has a keen interest in a team within the borders of New York City. The league has 16 teams in the United States and 3 in Canada. A former fairgrounds that hosted the 1964 and 1939 World’s Fairs, the 1,255-acre park is dotted with arenas like CitiField; the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center , home to the United States Open championship each year; and a new aquatics and ice-skating center. The effort could be held up by other claims to the real estate: the proposed site includes eight acres in a little-used corner of the park that are home to the Fountain of the Planets , a defunct relic of the 1964 World’s Fair.

Blue for The New York Times    Approval for a new stadium would require legislation to allow construction on parkland with a requirement that an equal amount of new parkland is created elsewhere.

There are also expatriates from other countries like Argentina, Colombia and Uruguay in the neighborhoods around the park. Luis Montoya, 65, the president of the Big Apple Youth Soccer League, which plays in the park, said the community had pushed for more soccer fields and a stadium for decades, with no success.

Tickets are $20 to $200, some of the cheapest in professional sports. As recently as April, Flushing did not appear to be the league’s first choice among the 19 sites it considered. The league was focusing on the possibility of building the stadium at Pier 40 on the West Side of Manhattan. But that plan fell victim to community opposition and a high price that would have included more than $100 million merely to prepare the pier’s infrastructure to accommodate a stadium.   Correction: August 17, 2012   An article in some editions on Thursday about soccer enthusiasts’ hopes that Major League Soccer will bring a team and stadium to Queens, a project supported by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, misstated the middle initial of an aide to Mr. Cuomo in some editions. He is Lawrence S. Schwartz, not Lawrence A.      Jack Bell contributed reporting.  A version of this article appears in print on August 16, 2012, on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Soccer Enthusiasts Hope For a Stadium in Queens.
