Although he took over the job at the age of 36 without previously having worked in Formula One, Boullier does have a lot of racing experience. Born and raised in Le Mans, France, he discovered his passion at 14 when his parents took him to see the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. He studied aeronautic and spacecraft engineering, working in racing in his spare time before joining a team upon graduation. He has worked in endurance racing, in the Formula Nissan series based in Spain, and in 2003 he became the technical director and manager of the DAMS F3000 team. Last year, he was briefly in charge of Gravity Sport Management, a driver management company supported by Gerard Lopez, part owner of Genii Capital. When Lopez led Genii’s buyout of the Renault team over the winter, Boullier was hired to run the team. He spoke with Brad Spurgeon of the International Herald Tribune. Q.What are the main challenges of your new job? A. It was a big challenge at first, especially with me coming from a style of racing where there was a small structure. I was used to managing 70 people and not 500 people, so that’s a big difference. It was a bit of a challenge to adapt and understand, especially with no F1 experience. But definitely my technical background — and my racing background — was a big help because I understand the business on the track. And one of the first steps, and the first challenge, was to gain some respect from the team. And now after several months having the full support of Genii and Gerard Lopez and Eric Lux [co-director of Genii], it’s obviously a good help for me. And it is obviously good as well to have some good results on track. Q.You are part of a new generation of team directors who have come up from the lower series, like Christian Horner of Red Bull, who was also an F3000 team director. A. I think it’s just a timing issue. F1 went bigger and bigger and bigger, especially after the arrival of the car manufacturers. Today, clearly it is in a period of transition and needs to downsize a bit. It is clearly the third-largest sport in the world, it’s clearly a big, big, big machine, and it is clearly a big success. I think in recent years there was more media coverage on the bad affairs, and on a couple of ego wars, and now it’s a time for people like Christian Horner or myself — we are pure racers — and I think this team can be a perfect example of the transition. It is still backed by a car manufacturer — still its official representative and with the company colors and the name on the car — but it is being managed by multiple entities.

Q.What are the main differences in Formula One and the lower series? In terms of the racing job, it’s 95 percent the same — same politics, same obligations, everything the same. The word is “more.” There is more everywhere: more requests, more media, more responsibilities. It’s tougher, everything is different, and I enjoy it more, maybe — I will let you know later, it is a bit too fresh for me. I definitely enjoy my job, but everything is bigger, or more.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Q.How difficult is the challenge of rebuilding the image of the team after the cheating scandal? The first challenge was to isolate the technical team, to make sure the technical team can just do what they are here for, which is working on the racing car, to make sure the team is focused on its racing. The second thing was to have this change of color of the car back to the historical colors of the Renault team. And the last thing was to speak to the media and just to introduce ourselves and to show the new faces — Genii, myself — and to explain to them the strategy and to have a new media management based on transparency and honesty.

And last but not least is the successful strategic alliance between Genii and Renault through which we have signed new sponsors. And that has also helped the team, as well, to show there is a new dynamic in place. There is no secret, nothing special. We are in Formula One, we are here to race, let’s do our jobs the best we can. Q.What’s Genii’s interest in racing? Gerard Lopez loves racing cars and cars. But Formula One is the third-most-popular sport in the world — I insist on this, behind Olympics and World Cup soccer — and Genii had this idea to create a sort of B-to-B platform, a marketing tool. And the key thing is they wanted to be associated as a car manufacturer, as well. It’s clearly used as a platform to bring new partners, new potential partners, potential investors, to activate all their portfolios in their respective private equity funds and to make synergies with Renault. The great thing is that it works, and it works much more than expected. We’re completely inundated with requests for meetings. Q.How did you become interested in racing? A. I discovered racing when I was 14. My parents brought me to see the 24 Hours of La Mans and I loved it. During my studies, although I was clearly interested in motor racing, for me it was too unstable as a career choice. I knew no one in motor racing, and my parents did not have a lot of money. So I decided to study engineering, for aircraft and space, because aircraft and racing cars are exactly the same. But during my studies I was spending all of my holidays in the paddock, doing any kind of job — I did Le Mans, GT, Formula Renault — and I was offering my services for free. I had to work one month to earn money and one month doing racing. Step by step, I went up the categories, and when I graduated I did a training period in the DAMS team and they hired me, and I decided to stick in racing just to see what would happen. And I’m still there. Q.You worked with the last French Formula One driver, Sébastien Bourdais, at that time at DAMS in F3000 in 2001, and he is also from Le Mans. Would you like to have him back in Formula One? My priority is to make this team world champion. If it has to be with an Argentine driver and a Korean driver, it will be with an Argentine and a Korean. But today — especially the way we are working with Genii — it is a worldwide platform. Everywhere we go racing, we have a lot of meetings and interconnections and synergies are created. But if tomorrow we have to have two French drivers to win, to be world champion because they are the best drivers on the market, then we’ll have two French drivers. It is not because I am a Frenchman that I want to have a French driver: my interest is for Renault F1, that’s it.
