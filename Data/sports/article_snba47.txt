It lasts about 90 seconds and features footage of Tejada doing a little of everything and doing it all well. He hits, he runs, he fields, he jumps up and down and clicks his cleats, he gives animated handshakes to teammates, he signs autographs for fans and he looks perpetually blissful. The only thing Tejada does not do is speak. Perhaps that is by design. Words can speak louder than actions. Not even the Orioles are certain about who the real Tejada is anymore. Is he the player spotlighted on the scoreboard and the player who still seems to be excited about being here? Or is he the exasperated superstar who requested a trade in December because he felt the team was not doing enough to improve? Of course, Tejada insisted he was the energetic player on the video and a man who still has a mission to succeed with the Orioles. But the Orioles have not had a winning season since 1997, and it would be surprising if they leapfrogged the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox and made the postseason in 2006.

You'll see a smiling face on me."  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       But if the Orioles do not win, will the smile fade? How many losses might it take for Tejada, who is in the third year of a six-year, $72 million contract, to resurrect his desire to move to another baseball address? Because there will be lots of losses for Baltimore this season. "Everything is done," Tejada said. "The team is getting better. That's what I want. I don't want to think about that no more." The Orioles think about it. Although Jim Duquette, the vice president for baseball operations, said he believed Tejada was content and spoke glowingly of him, the Orioles were disparaged by Tejada once, so they will surely be ready if there are any more words out of shallow left field. The Orioles feel that Tejada will continue to be pleased as long as they win consistently. [The team improved to 9-7 Wednesday night after defeating the visiting Cleveland Indians, 18-9.] By that logic, another disruption could loom. Tejada and the Orioles begin a three-game series at Yankee Stadium on Friday night. Tejada is a significant part of Baltimore's elusive efforts to win, a cleanup batter who has averaged 30 homers and 124 runs batted in for the past two seasons. [He was batting .375 with two homers after going 3 for 5 Wednesday night against the Indians.] But the continued development of young pitchers like Rodrigo López, Daniel Cabrera and Erik Bedard and an urgency to build a reliable bullpen are also critical for the future. If the Orioles stumble, and Tejada watches David Ortiz, his friend on the Red Sox, heading toward another postseason, there is always a chance for "Miguel Is Mad, The Sequel." "Let's see if we can make the playoffs," Tejada said. "That's my goal. I think that would be better than anything in my life right now."   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Tejada, who has a sweet uppercut swing and a strong arm, is one of the elite players in the major leagues. He plays hard and plays hurt. [He played in his 934th straight game on Wednesday.] He was also the American League's most valuable player with the Oakland Athletics in 2002. "For me, he's the best shortstop in baseball now," said Melvin Mora, the Orioles' third baseman. "No doubt about it. He hits for power. He catches the ball. He's played in 900 straight games. What else can I say? That's special." The polite Tejada has become more guarded after a messy 2005. He was blindsided after Rafael Palmeiro, a former teammate who tested positive for steroids last season, pulled Tejada into the controversy by saying that a B-12 vitamin shot that Tejada gave him might have been the source of the positive test. "He had to deal with the B-12 thing," Manager Sam Perlozzo said. "He's such a proud guy, and the fact that someone was questioning him, it hurt him." Tejada's two drug tests in 2005 were negative, but he was worried that his reputation had been forever stained. Tejada said he navigated through it by reminding himself that he was simply trying to help a fatigued Palmeiro.

While Tejada said he never asked Palmeiro for an explanation, he added that he would accept an apology if Palmeiro offered one. Tejada considers Palmeiro a friend, he said. After Palmeiro received a 10-day suspension on Aug. 1, Tejada hobbled through the last 57 games with 4 homers and 28 R.B.I. His 26 homers and 98 R.B.I. last year were his lowest totals since 1999. That disappointing ending and an off-season in which the Yankees, the Red Sox and the Toronto Blue Jays added marquee players contributed to Tejada telling The Associated Press on Dec. 8 that he needed a change of scenery.

The Orioles, whose major off-season move was signing catcher Ramón Hernández to a four-year contract, had to adjust plans abruptly and have discussions about trading their premier player. The Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs were the most interested. But in the first week of January, Tejada called Duquette and rescinded the request. It was a dizzying period for the Orioles, who, no matter how they depict it publicly, now have a different relationship with Tejada. "When we first talked to Miggy, we told him we wanted to turn the page," said Duquette, referring to Tejada by his nickname. "That's what we've done." Mora, who lives in Baltimore in the off-season, said Tejada called him from the Dominican Republic "50 million times" to ask how fans had reacted to his remarks. The fans want to win, Mora told Tejada, so they were not angry. "I was worried that he was going to leave," Mora said. "I wasn't worried about what he was thinking. He made his own decisions. That's his career. Would we miss him? Of course, but there's nothing we could do about it." Perlozzo said it was "out of character" for Tejada to create a commotion, but Perlozzo felt that Tejada's intentions were sincere. "Here's a guy that just wants to win," he said. "It had nothing to do, I didn't think, with wanting to get out." Standing in front of his locker with his arms folded, Tejada nodded after hearing Perlozzo's comments. Even though Tejada's complaining put the Orioles in an awkward position, he has no regrets.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   "I don't think I hurt nobody," Tejada said. "I think what I said I speak for everybody in here. Everybody wants to win. That's the thing I asked for." Tejada is the best player on the Orioles, but he is eager to play in the postseason, so he is not the happiest player on the Orioles. If the Orioles get into the playoffs, Tejada said, his smile "will be even bigger." But to make that happen, the Orioles must win. Unless that changes dramatically, Tejada's relationship with the team could eventually become tenuous again. "What I told Miggy is this," Mora said. "You say you want to win. If you leave, how are we going to win?"  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
