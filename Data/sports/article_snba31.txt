PETERSBURG, Fla. — In a devil of a decade, Chuck LaMar had tried to envision the moment when Tropicana Field would host the World Series. It arrived this week, and LaMar was there to see it. That much is true. The rest of the story turned out differently than LaMar had hoped. As the first general manager for the team then known as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays , LaMar never designed a team that won more than 70 games in a season. Fired after 2005, he now serves as the director of professional scouting for the Philadelphia Phillies , the team trying to beat the Rays in the World Series. “Sitting here, to have had some impact on both teams in the series, it’s really overwhelming,” LaMar said before Game 1, on the bench in the Phillies’ dugout. Eight players on the Rays’ World Series roster were in the organization in LaMar’s final season as the general manager. That includes three starting pitchers and the outfielders Carl Crawford and B. J. Upton. Another starter, Matt Garza, and shortstop Jason Bartlett were acquired from Minnesota  for Delmon Young, the player LaMar chose first in the 2003 draft.

The team began play in 1998, the same year as the Arizona Diamondbacks, who reached the playoffs in 1999 by spending lavishly on veterans. The Rays tried a similar blueprint but could never keep up. Their commitment to development was compromised right away, when they lost their top three picks in the 1998 draft for signing the veteran free agents Roberto Hernández, Wilson Alvarez and Dave Martinez. Other moves backfired, including the  acquisitions of the aging sluggers José Canseco, Greg Vaughn and Vinny Castilla. LaMar’s staff sometimes made shrewd draft choices — including starters James Shields (16th round, 2000) and Andy Sonnanstine (13th round, 2004) — and he fleeced the Mets for Scott Kazmir in a deal for Víctor Zambrano. But the major league team was a colossal failure, and predictably, the fans stayed away. LaMar, who still lives in nearby Clearwater, Fla., said he never stopped believing the region would eventually embrace the team. “I knew in my heart, the day I took the job, that there would be a championship-caliber team in Tampa Bay, and when that day came, that the fans of this area would support it,” LaMar said. “And through all of our tough times, you heard words like relocation and contraction. To me, that would have been a fatal mistake for Major League Baseball to give up on this area.  Photo        Chuck LaMar, left, with the former outfielder Ben Grieve in

Now I think everybody nationally can see not only what a fabulous area this is to live in, but that it truly deserves major league baseball.” LaMar, 50, has been working in baseball for 23 years. His successor, Andrew Friedman, 31, worked on Wall Street before joining the Rays in 2004 for a two-year apprenticeship as director of baseball development. Since taking over for LaMar — and given the title of executive vice president for baseball operations — Friedman has orchestrated a series of successful drafts, signings and trades, with help from a veteran baseball man, the senior vice president Gerry Hunsicker, who was a Mets executive in 1991 and 1992.

After two years of scrounging, Friedman sensed in February that the team was ready to start winning.

We didn’t necessarily expect it to be this year, but we’re not complaining.” Last month, Friedman was named as Sports Illustrated’s executive of the year, a title that never was applied to LaMar. But LaMar is not alone in leaving an imprint on a franchise he left. The Phillies would not be here without many players acquired during  Ed Wade’s tenure as the general manager. When Boston  won in 2004, it had several stars acquired by its former general manager, Dan Duquette, including Johnny Damon, Derek Lowe, Pedro Martínez, Manny Ramírez and Jason Varitek. LaMar knows of those precedents and cited several others. He has credited his successors for their work and said he did the best job he could while he had it. “In baseball, it happens all the time where an organization starts to develop a group of players, and for whatever reason, a change is made and the next regime finishes the job,” LaMar said. “You can go on and on. What is happening here with the Rays, it’s a great story.”   A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: LaMar, Now With Phillies, Helped Build the Rays.
