It was 1,307, not 2,800. The article also misidentified the academic affiliation of a doctor who commented on supplements and steroids. The doctor, Shalender Bhasin, is a professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine and chief of endocrinology, diabetes and nutrition at Boston Medical Center. He is not a professor at Boston Medical Center. And the article misidentified the nationality of the soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, whose body a teenager quoted in the article said he would like to emulate. Mr. Ronaldo is Portuguese, not Brazilian. BUSINESS DAY An article on Saturday about the difficulty in keeping e-mail private misstated a procedure in e-mail encryption services. The sender of an encrypted message must first get a key from the intended recipient; the recipient does not need a key to read the message once it is sent. SPORTS Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the revival of the U.C.L.A. football team misstated the names of the team’s coach and his father. Jim L. Mora is the coach and his father is Jim E.; they are not Jim Mora Jr. and Jim Mora Sr. The article also referred incorrectly to U.C.L.A.’s 50-point loss to Southern California last season. It was the last game for U.C.L.A.’s coach, Rick Neuheisel, before he was fired; the loss was not his last game with the team. (After being fired, Neuheisel stayed on to coach the Bruins in the Pacific-12 championship game four days later.) • An article on Monday about the New England Patriots’ 59-24 victory over the Indianapolis Colts the previous day misstated the Colts’ lead in the American Football Conference wild-card standing. It is one game, not two.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       WEEKEND A film review on Friday about “Turning,” a concert film documenting a tour of the band Antony and the Johnsons, referred imprecisely to people shown on a rotating stand. They are women and transgendered people; they do not include transvestites. SCIENCE TIMES Because of an editing error, a report in the Vital Signs column on Tuesday about the use of probiotics to reduce the risk of a type of diarrhea by 66 percent described Saccharomyces incorrectly. It is a genus of yeasts, not a bacterium. • An article on Tuesday about the birthrate of stars in the universe misstated the sound made by pressure waves coming out of a black hole in the galaxy NGC 1275. The sound is that of a B flat 57 octaves below middle C, not 27 octaves. • An article on Tuesday about using MDMA, or Ecstasy, in combination with psychotherapy to treat post-traumatic stress described incorrectly the office arrangement that a husband-and-wife team use to conduct therapy sessions using MDMA. The couple, Michael and Ann Mithoefer, hold the sessions in an office in a converted house; they do not conduct the sessions in their home office. And because of an editing error, an accompanying picture carried an incorrect credit. The photograph of the Mithoefers was taken by Hunter McRae, not by Gretchen Ertl.
