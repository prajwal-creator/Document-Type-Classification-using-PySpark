To the Editor: Today ends a campaign in which candidates sparred over inequalities of income and wealth. But another form of inequality, political inequality, has received much less attention. One of the basic tenets of democracy is that the preferences and needs of all citizens should receive equal consideration. If political voice — expressed when citizens vote, contact public officials, protest, support political organizations, donate to campaigns or otherwise take part in political life — is unequal, then equal consideration is jeopardized. Policy makers hear from a limited, and unrepresentative, set of people who are, on average, better educated and more affluent. Campaign contributors are much more affluent. Those who express political voice also have different life experiences. They are, for example, more likely to have health insurance and to live in a house in good repair. Political activity by organized interests, which spend huge sums outside campaigns on policy influence, reinforces unequal voice. Organizations representing those with deep pockets vastly outnumber advocates for the middle class and the poor. And of the billions of dollars spent annually on lobbying in Washington, 72 percent comes from organizations representing business interests, and no more than 2 percent from organizations representing the vast majority below the very top.

A now-defunct program from the 1970s subsidized resource-poor citizens’ groups to take part in hearings in some government agencies. Twenty-four states have some provision for funding elections through the public treasury. More ambitious would be an educational system that delivered as well for the less privileged as it does for those higher on the ladder.

Inequality of political voice has long been with us and is deeply entrenched in American politics. KAY LEHMAN SCHLOZMAN SIDNEY VERBA HENRY E. BRADY Boston, Nov. 5, 2012 The writers are political scientists at Boston College, Harvard and Berkeley, respectively, and co-authors of “The Unheavenly Chorus: Unequal Political Voice and the Broken Promise of American Democracy.” Readers React Professors Schlozman, Verba and Brady have it fundamentally wrong when they write, “If political voice ... is unequal, then equal consideration is jeopardized.” The Constitution does not guarantee every citizen an “equal voice.” It guarantees to every citizen an equal vote, and the freedom to use whatever resources are available to that citizen — be it intelligence, education, charisma, fame, shoe leather and elbow grease, control of a newspaper or wealth — to persuade his or her fellow citizens to vote in favor of or against candidates. The notion that the state should intervene to ensure that no citizen has more influence than any other citizen is pernicious and, as the Supreme Court noted in 1976 in Buckley v. Valeo , “wholly foreign” to our values and history. DOUGLAS B. LEVENE Shenzhen, China, Nov. 6, 2012 The writer is a professor at Peking University School of Transnational Law.  As the writers note, there will always be some political inequality: There have always been, and there always will be, citizens whose oratorical prowess, social stature and even physical appearance allow them to wield a greater influence on public opinion than their peers. What is different now from other eras is the widespread realization, in the wake of the unpopular Wall Street bailouts, that decision makers listen to lobbyists more than to their constituents.

These groups are natural allies, but the left-right paradigm divides and weakens them. What is needed to resolve this discontent is to break out of the left-right, two-party system. PHILIPPE STEPHENSON Montreal, Nov. 6, 2012  The political inequality in the United States that the writers highlight is largely a function of economic inequality. Those individuals and organizations with more money are able to translate that into political influence through campaign donations, lobbying efforts, contributions to think tanks and so on. America has the highest level of economic inequality among Western democracies, and it is getting worse rather than better thanks to Republican policies like tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. Until we begin to encourage a more fair distribution of income and wealth, political inequality will continue to undermine democracy in this country.

I am amazed that the political scientists did not even mention labor unions. Of course, unions today are no longer as powerful as they once were. After several decades of bashing and busting — and admittedly too much corruption and association with organized crime — they have lost much of their political clout.

Whether workers belonged to unions or not, they enjoyed the benefits of higher wages, better working conditions, health insurance and the retirement plans that unions negotiated. It is time for us to wake up and realize that we can regain political power in this country only by banding together in some way. And it must be a way that forces the rich and powerful to share their wealth and power. Collective bargaining in the private and public sectors is a very good way to accomplish this goal. JEFF COLLINS Evanston, Ill., Nov. 6, 2012  When one of my students, Andrew Lipkowitz, and I studied the 21 Senate votes since 2009 on issues that pitted financial institutions against consumers, we found that senators who voted for consumers 35 percent or less of the time received financial industry contributions 58 percent higher than senators who voted for consumers at least 65 percent of the time. Banks don’t win all the time — Congress created a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — but they win a lot of the time. Banks got their bailouts, bankers are paid well and the consumer bureau still doesn’t have a permanent director.

The most glaring political inequality in the United States is the natural-born citizen clause, which effectively separates American citizens into two unequal classes, with one having the right to aspire to reach the presidency, the very summit of political and public life, and the other barred from this for life. If Americans treasure equal rights before the law, repealing the natural-born clause is the first place to start. JAN MORUP Copenhagen, Nov. 6, 2012 The Writers Respond Mr. Levene rightly emphasizes liberty as essential to democracy, but we see no contradiction with our assertion “If political voice ... is unequal, then equal consideration is jeopardized.” To understand everyone’s needs and concerns, policy makers need be exposed to a representative set of voices. The arms race in campaign funding means that they spend more time with people who have deep pockets and less with people who are worried about finding jobs, paying for college or making sure that their health insurance will cover an expensive treatment. Those with intelligence, education, charisma or fame will always be more effective in politics, but wealth is different. Political issues divide us on the basis of wealth, but not brains or charisma. As we saw in this campaign, wealth can be deployed anonymously, without the public’s knowing its source. And, as Mr. Amy notes, when economic inequality increases, as it has in America, some people have megaphones costing millions while almost everyone else can only whisper. Mr. Collins reminds us about the important and diminishing role played by unions in providing political voice for ordinary people. There are nearly a thousand associations active in Washington politics that organize people on the basis of what they do for a living. Other than unions, less than 10 percent bring together people in nonprofessional and nonmanagerial occupations. Not a single one represents unskilled workers who are not union members. No one would expect full equality of political voice, but we are so far from it as to leave our democracy significantly compromised.
