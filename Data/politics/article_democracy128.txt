The ensemble — with the drummer Kaspar Rast, the bassist Thomy Jordi and the multireedist known as Sha — has a new live double album out on ECM, which gives some indication of what will transpire here. At 6:30 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com ; $20 in advance, $25 day of show. (Nate Chinen) Seamus Blake Group (Tuesday and Wednesday) Seamus Blake is a smartly assertive tenor and soprano saxophonist in tune with the post-bop mainstream. His current band is built for sharp turns, with Lage Lund on guitar, Dave Kikoski on piano, Matt Clohesy on bass and Ari Hoenig on drums. From 9 p.m. to 12:30 a.m., Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 252-5091, smallsjazzclub.com ; $20 cover. (Chinen) Freddie Bryant and Kaleidoscope (Tuesday) The guitarist Freddie Bryant favors a clarity of attack, both in his own playing and in the actions of Kaleidoscope, his working band. He’s appearing here with most of the expanded lineup found on his new album, “Live Grooves... Epic Tales” (Hipnotic): Donny McCaslin and Yosvany Terry on saxophones, Juan Galiardo on piano, Patrice Blanchard on bass and Willard Dyson on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net ; $20 cover. (Chinen) George Burton Group (Friday and Saturday) George Burton, a charismatic young pianist from Philadelphia, isn’t as well known as he should be, though he has carved out a strong niche as a sideman in both modern jazz and R&B. He brings his own direction to this combo, an almost all-Philadelphia lineup on Friday with a dynamite front line (the trumpeter Terell Stafford, the tenor saxophonist Tim Warfield) and a dynamic rhythm team (Luques Curtis on bass, Rodney Green on drums). It’ll be a trio on Saturday, when Stacy Dillard joins Mr. Burton and Mr. Curtis. From 10:15 p.m. to 1 a.m., Smalls Jazz Club, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 252-5091, smallsjazzclub.com ; $20 cover. (Chinen)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   James Carney Quartet (Friday) James Carney is a pianist and composer with a fondness for plot twists and intriguing orchestration; he has the capacity for both in this quartet with the multireedist Oscar Noriega, the bassist Chris Lightcap and the drummer Chad Taylor. At 8:30 p.m., IBeam, 168 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, ibeambrooklyn.com ; $10 suggested donation. (Chinen)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Bill Charlap Trio (Friday through Sunday) The pianist Bill Charlap, the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Kenny Washington make up this spit-and-polish trio, which favors a crisp approach to standard songbook fare. The trio’s two-week engagement draws to a close this weekend. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com ; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) George Coleman Organ Quintet (Thursday through Oct. 28) A tenor saxophonist of voluble expertise, George Coleman seeks a soulful path with this group, enlisting the Hammond B-3 organist Mike LeDonne and the guitarist Russell Malone. On drums is George Coleman Jr., and Daniel Sadownick is the percussionist. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set next Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net ; $25; $30 next Friday and Saturday. (Chinen) Kris Davis Trio (Saturday) An inquisitive pianist with a willful but methodical approach to experimentation, Kris Davis has made herself indispensable on New York’s left-of-center jazz scene in recent years. She has top-flight accompaniment here, from the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Nasheet Waits. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com ; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars (Friday through Oct. 21) In addition to being a bebop pioneer and a dazzling trumpeter, Dizzy Gillespie — whose birthday would have fallen during this engagement — was one of jazz’s better talent scouts. That point is hammered home by the scattered alumni in this legacy band, including the multireedist Paquito D’Rivera, the pianist Cyrus Chestnut and the bassist John Lee. Taking turns as Gillespie’s proxy are Terrell Stafford (on Sunday) and Jeremy Pelt (on Saturday); on drums is the impeccable Lewis Nash. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net ; $35 cover at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) An Evening of Jazz: A Fundraiser for Barack Obama (Sunday) It lacks the celebrity quotient and sheer talent pool of Jazz for Obama, a gala concert held earlier this month; it also lacks the three-digit ticket price. And each of the three working bands involved — Sex Mob, the Noah Preminger Quartet, the Randy Ingram Trio — has its own claim on progressivism, and its own approach to democratic interplay. At 10 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com ; $30. (Chinen) Pedro Giraudo Septet Performs the Music of Darcy James Argue (Friday) In one sense Pedro Giraudo, an Argentine bassist, is the heavy lifter in this concert, part of the Seeing Jazz With George Wein series. But there’s a twist: Mr. Giraudo’s septet will be playing compositions by Darcy James Argue, his fellow big-band composer-bandleader. Mr. Giraudo and Mr. Argue will also take part in an onstage interview with the impresario and producer George Wein. At 7:30 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org ; $30, $25 for members, $15 for under 30. (Nate Chinen) Jimmy Heath 86th Birthday Celebration (Tuesday through Oct. 28) Jimmy Heath, the bebop-honed saxophonist, composer, bandleader and educator, has been enjoying a late-career eminence, but that doesn’t mean he’s resting on his laurels. You may have seen him recently with the Heath Brothers, or with the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars — or with his own well-stocked big band, a version of which appears here. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net ; $35 cover at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ★ Vijay Iyer Trio (Monday and Wednesday) Led by the pianist-composer Vijay Iyer and featuring the bassist Stephan Crump and the drummer Marcus Gilmore, this trio has released two acclaimed albums within the last few years, each striking a balance of cleverly reframed cover tunes and vertiginously propulsive originals. The group appears on Monday in Brooklyn, playing a concert set at 7 p.m. and a more informal club set at 9 p.m. On Wednesday it performs at 8:30 p.m. as part of a “Soundcheck Live!” series, with an 8 p.m. opening set by Victoire, an eclectic chamber project of the composer Missy Mazzoli. Monday at Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, 58 Seventh Avenue, at Lincoln Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 622-3300, bqcm.org ; $25 seated admission, $20 for students, $15 standing room, $10 children under 10. Wednesday at Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 417-7050, artsworldfinancialcenter.com ; free. (Chinen) ★ The Jazz Gallery Home Run Benefit Concert II (Wednesday) The Jazz Gallery, an essential roost and incubator for up-and-coming jazz talent, has been searching for a new home. This benefit, the second of its kind, will feature the alto saxophonist Miguel Zenón, in a trio with Larry Grenadier on bass and Johnathan Blake on drums (at 10 p.m.); the alto saxophonist Steve Coleman, working with the drummer Dafnis Prieto, the trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson, the vocalist Kokayi and the bassist Anthony Tidd (at 9 p.m.); and Mehliana, an electro-acoustic collaboration between the drummer Mark Guiliana and the keyboardist Brad Mehldau. At Rockwood Music Hall, Stage 2, 196 Allen Street, between Stanton and Houston Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 477-4155, rockwoodmusichall.com ; $35. (Chinen) ★ Azar Lawrence Quintet (Tuesday through Oct. 28) A tenor saxophonist squarely in the post-Coltrane continuum, still best recognized for his prolific output in the 1970s, Azar Lawrence has been back on the circuit, releasing albums and playing weeklong club engagements. The title of this one is “Celebrating John Coltrane & Elvin Jones” — a natural fit for Mr. Lawrence, and for the crew he has assembled: Eddie Henderson on trumpet, Benito Gonzalez on piano, Essiet Okun Essiet on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org ; $30 to $40 cover, $15 for students for select sets, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.

His pointedly named Electric Band, appearing here as part of the Pace Presents series, includes Henry Johnson on guitar, Tim Gant on keyboards, Joshua Ramos on bass and Charles Heath on drums. At 7:30 p.m., Schimmel Center for the Arts, Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, between Park Row and Gold Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 346-1715, pace.edu/culture ; $30 to $55. (Chinen) Bill Mays Trio Plays Stephen Sondheim (Saturday) Mr. Mays, a sophisticated and lyrical pianist, focuses here on some of the most urbane songs in the modern musical-theater repertory, with an assist from Tommy Cecil on bass and Duduka Da Fonseca on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com ; $25 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen) ★ Bill McHenry Quartet (Tuesday through Oct. 28) The tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry finds a place for rugged insight in this hard-driving but elastic band, featuring the pianist Orrin Evans, the bassist Eric Revis and the drummer Andrew Cyrille. The group is celebrating the release of “La Peur du Vide” (Sunnyside), an engrossing album recorded during its most recent engagement, in the same room earlier this year. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com ; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) ★ Cécile McLorin Salvant and Friends (Monday) A savvy, arresting young singer in the Sarah Vaughan-Abbey Lincoln lineage, Ms. Salvant was a relative unknown in the jazz world until she won the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in 2010. She just recorded an album (scheduled to be released next year on the Mack Avenue label), and its personnel — the pianist Aaron Diehl, the guitarist James Chirillo, the bassist Rodney Whitaker, the drummer Herlin Riley — suggests the level of talent that will join her here. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org ; $20 to $25 cover, $10 for students, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) Charles McPherson-Tom Harrell Quintet (Friday through Sunday) Bebop, sharp and driving, provides a common language for the alto saxophonist Charles McPherson and the trumpeter Tom Harrell, both experienced hands. Their rhythm section has Jeb Patton on piano, Rufus Reid on bass and Willie Jones III on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org ; $40 cover, $15 for students for select sets, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) Merger (Friday) Don’t let the transactional nature of the name give you the wrong impression. All negotiating parties — the cornetist Kirk Knuffke, the alto saxophonist Andrew D’Angelo, the bassist Ben Street, the drummer Nasheet Waits — are coming to the table with the same agenda of collective epiphany, and with as little paperwork as possible. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com ; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Nicholas Payton XXX (Friday and Saturday) A trumpeter of incisive prowess — and, in recent seasons, a dauntless provocateur — Nicholas Payton blends modern jazz with elements of funk and soul in the lean, groove-oriented band he calls XXX. In addition to trumpet, he plays Fender Rhodes and acoustic piano in the band; his partners are the bassist Vicente Archer, the drummer Henry Cole and the percussionist Daniel Sadownick. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com ; $30 and $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) ★ Scott Robinson Doctette (Wednesday) Scott Robinson, an idiosyncratic but adaptable multireedist, spends much of his working life in polished, precise ensembles like the Maria Schneider Orchestra. Left to his own devices — literally as well as figuratively — he occasionally comes up with something like “Bronze Nemesis” (Doc-Tone), inspired by Doc Savage, the pulp superhero of the 1930s and ’40s. As on the album, Mr. Robinson appears here with a theremin and a wind machine, along with an array of saxophones; he also enlists Randy Sandke on trumpet and euphonium, Ted Rosenthal on piano, Pat O’Leary on bass and Dennis Mackrel on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net ; $20 cover. (Chinen) Dr. Lonnie Smith Organ Trio (Tuesday through Oct. 27) As on a fine recent album, “Spiral” (Palmetto), the organist Dr. Lonnie Smith pursues a searching brand of soul jazz. His partners are both veterans in the style: the guitarist Rodney Jones and the drummer Donald Edwards. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com ; $30 to $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) Tamarindo (Tuesday) The saxophonist Tony Malaby has earned a reputation as one of New York’s stalwart improvisers, through an array of sideman appointments and some rigorously rewarding albums. Tamarindo is the name of his free-form trio with the bassist William Parker; in the past the drummer has been Nasheet Waits, but Mark Ferber steps up to the plate here. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com ; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) The TD James Moody Democracy of Jazz Festival (Friday through Sunday) Named in honor of the saxophonist James Moody, who died in 2010, this new festival is a joint presentation of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and WBGO (88.3 FM), with title sponsorship from TD Bank. Among the highlights are “For the Love of Moody,” a concert on Friday at 8 p.m. featuring the Manhattan Transfer, the guitarist George Benson and the saxophonists David Sanborn and Jimmy Heath, among others; “Miles Davis and Gill Evans: Still Ahead,” a repertory concert on Saturday at 8 p.m. with Terence Blanchard on trumpet, Vince Mendoza conducting and Christian McBride, the festival’s artistic director, on bass; and, on Sunday at 3 p.m., the first edition of a Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition. (Vaughan, like Moody, was one of Newark’s brightest stars.) A full schedule is at njpac.org . New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org ; varying prices. (Nate Chinen) ★ Jacky Terrasson Trio (Friday through Sunday) The ever-whimsical but always poised pianist Jacky Terrasson has a sharp new working trio, with Burniss Travis on bass and Justin Faulkner on drums, though so far the evidence has mainly been aired abroad: on the European summer-festival circuit, and on a studio album, “Gouache” (Decca), that doesn’t yet have a United States release date. So consider this engagement a scouting opportunity. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net ; $25 to $30 cover. (Chinen) Myron Walden Momentum (Friday and Saturday) A few years ago Myron Walden, a longtime specialist on alto saxophone, decided to take up the tenor, adjusting to a different voice and register. “Momentum” (Demi Sound), released in 2009, was the first in a series of albums featuring the new instrument, at the forefront of a band modeled after the 1960s Miles Davis Quintet. Another version of that group appears here, featuring the trumpeter Darren Barrett, the pianist Eden Ladin, the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer Mark Whitfield, Jr. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com ; $30 cover. (Chinen)   A version of this schedule appears in print on October 19, 2012, on Page C19 of the New York edition with the headline: The Listings.
