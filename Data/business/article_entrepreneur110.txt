Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Now Playing ''AUTO FOCUS,'' starring Greg Kinnear, Willem Dafoe and Rita Wilson. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 104 minutes). In the tawdry life and violent demise of Bob Crane, star of the television sitcom ''Hogan's Heroes,'' Mr. Schrader has found a subject well suited to his preoccupations with sex, pornography and the existential agony of self-deluded men. As played by Mr. Kinnear, Crane is an affable, charming fellow undone by fame, promiscuity and videotape. His sex addiction is made creepier by his compulsion to record his trysts with the aid of technology supplied by John Carpenter (Mr. Dafoe), a video expert who was later tried in Crane's murder, and acquitted (a verdict the film regards with implicit skepticism). Despite Mr. Kinnear's smart, vivid performance, the movie keeps Crane at a distance. Mr. Schrader is ultimately less interested in the man than in the condition, and he has produced a moral tale that is chilling and disturbing but never really moving (A. O. Scott). * ''BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE,'' with Michael Moore. Written and directed by Mr. Moore (R, 119 minutes). Mr. Moore's latest documentary -- a rambling inquiry into the sources of violence and fear in American culture -- is tendentious and infuriating, full of ideological cheap shots and bullying interviews. It is also generous, disturbing, honest and funny. Since the subject, which sometimes seems to be nothing less than the nature of American society itself, is large and self-contradictory, it seems only fitting that the film (and the filmmaker) should share those attributes. The movie, populated by scapegoats, fools and striving, decent ordinary citizens -- in addition, of course, to Mr. Moore himself -- does not really present an argument, but it should incite quite a few, which is not such a bad thing (Scott). ''COMEDIAN,'' with Jerry Seinfeld. Directed by Christian Charles (R, 81 minutes). Having starred in one of the most successful television sitcoms ever, Mr. Seinfeld decided to break into the small time, returning to the comedy clubs where he cut his teeth and trying to put together an entirely new act. Mr. Charles's film, shot in grainy, low-light video, shows snippets of the act and provides glimpses of Mr. Seinfeld's offstage life, but its main concern is the professional culture of stand-up. In the company of his peers, Mr. Seinfeld reflects on the hard work and anxiety of his profession, and his efforts to keep his career going are contrasted with the struggle of a young comic named Orny Adams to start one. The movie is always engrossing, even if it is, inevitably, somewhat superficial. Not that there's anything wrong with that (Scott).

The mission of this film is essentially to garner sympathy for a white rapper involved in an old-school shootout -- a rap contest. This may be the final frontier for pop, more unbelievable than the prospect of launching a member of 'N Sync into orbit. The film's star, Eminem, doesn't appear to have a great deal of range, but he can play himself. Even though the protagonist is named Rabbit, the thoughtful ''8 Mile'' is a raw version of the rapper's own success story. This is basically an 80's go-for-it movie. (The picture feels like some odd combination of ''Flashdance'' and ''Purple Rain.'') Mr. Hanson has done a fine job of giving it a soul, though it's a gloomy, peeling-paint one. The movie has the echoey, haunted heart of Johnny Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nails' ''Hurt'': maybe the project doesn't make sense in the abstract, but once you submit to it, it works. The revelation in the film is Mr. Phifer, who shows a witty cool as Future, the black entrepreneur who runs rap contests at a Detroit club and believes in Rabbit (Elvis Mitchell).  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       * ''FAR FROM HEAVEN,'' starring Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid, Dennis Haysbert and Patricia Clarkson. Written and directed by Todd Haynes (PG-13, 107 minutes). Mr. Haynes (''Safe,'' ''Velvet Goldmine'') has both updated the now-classic Douglas Sirk melodramas of the 1950's and paid ardent, intelligent homage to their lush, subversive spirit. Ms. Moore plays Cathy Whitaker, a Hartford housewife whose leafy domestic idyll is shattered by her husband's homosexuality and her own illicit friendship with a black landscaper (Mr. Haysbert). The cast, which also includes Mr. Quaid as Cathy's unhappy husband and Ms. Clarkson as her poisonously compassionate best friend, is uniformly superb. The movie transcends irony or caricature, and reminds us how humane and how artful melodrama can be (Scott). ''FRIDA,'' starring Salma Hayek, Alfred Molina and Geoffrey Rush. Directed by Julie Taymor (R, 122 minutes). Ms. Taymor's celebration of the life of the Mexican Surrealist painter Frida Kahlo almost transcends the limitations of the biopic genre. Yes, the events of Kahlo's passionate, painful life are flattened out and crowded together, and no, we don't really understand her any better at the end of the movie, but when it departs from the conventions of realism, ''Frida'' explodes with color, music and sensuality. Ms. Hayek plays the artist with more charisma than insight, and her scenes with Mr. Molina (who plays Diego Rivera, Kahlo's straying, devoted husband) are clunky and literal, but Ms. Taymor is a playful, inventive and emotionally astute filmmaker constrained (as her subject rarely was) by convention. This is a responsible, pat film biography that wants most desperately to be a musical, and that almost succeeds (Scott). ''I SPY,'' starring Eddie Murphy, Owen Wilson, Bill Mondy and Malcolm McDowell. Directed by Betty Thomas (PG-13, 96 minutes). This film version of the old television series teams up Mr. Murphy and Mr. Wilson in the Bill Cosby and Robert Culp roles. The slim plot and its predictable third-act twist involve the theft of the Switchblade, the newest example of United States Stealth plane technology, by evildoers. That's the word used by the spy boss, McIntyre (Mr. Mondy), who assigns the bumbling special agent Alexander Scott (Mr. Wilson) to retrieve the stolen plane from the evildoer Gundars (Mr. McDowell). Scott is hooked up with the megalomaniacal boxing champ Kelly Robinson (Mr. Murphy). The president himself asks Robinson to go to Eastern Europe with Scott, serving as part of Scott's cover, so that they can infiltrate one of Gundars's huge parties and find out where the Switchblade is hidden. It's a novel notion, trying to shoehorn two actors who are born scene-stealers into a buddy comedy. But in this case, there are far more laughs in the idea of Mr. Murphy and Mr. Wilson fighting to upstage each other than there are in the movie (Mitchell).

Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (R, 97 minutes). In collaboration with Mr. Anderson (''Boogie Nights,'' ''Magnolia''), Mr. Sandler, without shaking off his familiar angry doofus persona, becomes the most improbable and inspired romantic hero in some time. He plays Barry Egan, an awkward, volatile bathroom-supply salesman who collects pudding in his spare time and who is harassed by his seven sisters and ensnared in a phone-sex extortion scam. Into the chaos of Barry's life -- brilliantly orchestrated by Mr. Anderson, with help from John Brion, who composed the swooning, percussive score -- comes Lena Leonard (Ms. Watson), who falls in love with him for no good reason. Which is fitting, since this movie delights in its own irrational, exuberant romanticism and will leave you in a flushed, intoxicated state best captured by its title (Scott). ''RED DRAGON,'' starring Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes. Directed by Brett Ratner (R, 126 minutes). In ''Dragon,'' Hannibal (the Cannibal) Lecter is played once again with relish -- and probably wasabi mayonnaise -- by Mr. Hopkins. But Lecter is such a huge presence at this point that he capsizes the picture's narrative, which is presumably a manhunt for a serial murderer other than Lecter. Lecter is in prison, but a killer is attacking families in their homes on a lunar cycle. The F.B.I. asks Will Graham (Mr. Norton), a retired agent, to help find him before the next full moon. So Graham asks Lecter for help. The best material in the picture is sparkling, drawing-room comedy, like the exchanges between Graham and Lecter. And there are gamy comic moments featuring Philip Seymour Hoffman as the tabloid reporter Freddy Lounds. But while Mr. Hopkins excels at Grand Guignol comic relief, it's tiresome because we've heard it all before. The entire picture is a third-generation Xerox copy: it's a thriller too timid to thrill (Mitchell). ''THE RING,'' starring Naomi Watts and David Dorfman. Directed by Gore Verbinski (PG-13, 115 minutes). This American remake of a famous Japanese suspense film is about an urban legend that has come to life: whenever a mysterious, unlabeled videotape is run, its unlucky viewer gets a phone call just after seeing it. The voice on the other end of the phone says simply, ''Seven days.'' It's how long the viewer has to live; and the corpse looks like something out of a Francis Bacon daydream. When her niece dies after seeing the videotape, Rachel (Ms. Watts), a Seattle reporter, decides to investigate the rumors. And that's when ''The Ring'' begins its downward spiral. She watches the freakout tape, complete with suffering animals, a fly crawling across the screen and static-ridden flash cuts. Much of what follows consists of close-ups of the clues that Rachel, desperate to beat the clock and stay alive, sifts through to solve the mystery. But while impressively made, this impassive and cold feature fails, in a spectacular fashion, to deliver the thrills (Mitchell). * ''ROGER DODGER,'' starring Campbell Scott, Jesse Eisenberg, Isabella Rossellini and Elizabeth Berkley. Written and directed by Dylan Kidd (R, 105 minutes). Roger Swanson (Mr. Scott), the slick motor-mouthed ad man who jabbers his way through Mr. Kidd's impressive filmmaking debut, is one of those barroom pundits who have an answer for everything, including a Darwinian philosophy of sex whose pseudoscientific logic camouflages a deep misogyny. The movie follows Roger and Nick (Mr. Eisenberg), his innocent teenage nephew from Ohio, through a grueling night of New York pub-crawling during which Roger tutors Nick on how to pick up women. Mr. Scott's portrayal of this charismatic creep is a dazzling star turn and change of pace for an actor who usually plays earnest good guys (Stephen Holden). ''THE SANTA CLAUSE 2,'' starring Tim Allen, Elizabeth Mitchell and David Krumholtz. Directed by Michael Lembeck (G, 98 minutes). In which Santa (Mr. Allen) returns from the North Pole to find a wife and patch up his relationship with his teenage son. Meanwhile, back at the office, a rogue toy Santa (Mr. Allen) has staged a coup d'Ã©tat and is threatening to fill the stockings of the world's children with coal. Instead, the kind people at Disney offer them this disposable holiday goodie, decked out with maudlin spirit-of-the-season hokum and smirky Tim Allen charm for the grown-ups (Scott). ''THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE,'' starring Mark Wahlberg, Thandie Newton and Tim Robbins. Directed by Jonathan Demme (PG-13, 104 minutes). Ms. Newton plays the recently married Regina, who returns home to her spacious Paris flat to break off with her husband, Charlie, an art dealer. She finds him gone and the apartment ransacked. When Charlie's corpse turns up and a pack of mysterious strangers pop around threatening Regina and asking questions about a treasure that he supposedly left behind, she's stunned. The truth about Charlie is that everybody knew more about him than she did. Regina's first hope is Joshua (Mark Wahlberg), a helpful American. But when even Joshua turns out not to be what he seemed, she has to turn to Bartholomew (Mr. Robbins) at the American Embassy for help. This knockabout, moderately successful remake of the 1963 comic thriller ''Charade'' lacks the heartless, silken cool of the original. Most of the remake's allure comes from the sensual, butter-voiced Ms. Newton; with her Mr. Demme has found the 21st-century corollary to Audrey Hepburn (Mitchell).

Directed by Peter Kosminsky (PG-13, 110 minutes). Janet Fitch's best-selling novel about the tormented relationship of an artist, imprisoned for murdering her unfaithful lover, and her teenage daughter, who is shuttled through a succession of foster homes, has been adapted into a movie of unusual depth and subtlety that captures several moods of Los Angeles. Ms. Pfeiffer gives the most complex screen performance of her career as the beautiful mother, a remorseless narcissist, who raises her daughter to believe the two of them are superior to ordinary mortals. Ms. Lohman's equally impressive portrayal of the daughter, herself a talented artist, maintains a perfectly calibrated balance between resentment and adoration. Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Penn are also memorable as foster mothers, one an insecure, clinging sometime B-movie actress, the other a trashy former stripper (Holden).
