Credit Lenny Ignelzi/Associated Press     Once upon a time — from the mid 1960s into the early 1980s — the Baltimore Orioles had the best organization in baseball. This is what they have now: By losing at least 41 of their remaining 89 games, they would become only the fourth team in history to have 10 successive losing seasons after a first-place finish, joining the Pittsburgh Pirates (en route to their 15th consecutive losing season after a 1992 first-place finish), the Boston Red Sox (15 losing seasons after 1918) and the Philadelphia Athletics (10 losing seasons after 1914). This is no fairy tale, but the story of a chaotic, poorly run organization. It is operated by an owner who bristles when he is likened to George Steinbrenner, insisting he is no Steinbrenner, but he has demonstrated time and again that he is the poor man’s Steinbrenner. Managers come, managers go. General managers come, general managers go. Except Peter Angelos, the owner, doesn’t care for the title of general manager, which he says is outmoded. The people who run the Orioles’ baseball operations are vice presidents for baseball operations. Except the Orioles’ media guide lists three assistant general managers. The title confusion epitomizes the chaotic way in which the Orioles have been run. It’s difficult enough competing in the same division as the Yankees and the Red Sox without having a clear and stable way of operating the team.

The Orioles have no assistant vice presidents for baseball operations.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       MacPhail, who this year has worked on projects for Commissioner Bud Selig and could have continued in that role, returns to an executive club position after his voluntary departure from an 11-year term as the chief executive of the Chicago Cubs. At 54, he was not ready to leave the world of baseball operations. But why the Orioles? “A couple years ago, a bunch of baseball people were sitting at the lunch table, and we went around the table saying what job we would like before our careers ended,” he said. The Baltimore job was MacPhail’s fantasy wish.  “I grew up there,” he said. “I walked around with my Jackie Brandt two-tone bat. My mother told the story that I wouldn’t go to school unless I could wear my Orioles pj’s.” But when his father, Lee, was the Orioles’ general manager from 1958 through 1965, no one interfered with him in the team’s baseball operations. MacPhail will work for an owner whose interfering hand has become legendary. “I wouldn’t be there if I didn’t have the assurances that I would have freedom to operate the team,” MacPhail said. “With the parameters the owner and I agreed to going in, it’s no different from Minnesota and Chicago. The owner has a responsibility to himself and his partners and has to set someone loose to operate within the parameters.” Unlike most of his predecessors in baseball operations — Roland Hemond, Pat Gillick, Frank Wren, Syd Thrift, Jim Beattie, Flanagan and Duquette — MacPhail has the advantage of knowing Angelos as an equal. “I know Angelos probably as well as anyone in baseball,” MacPhail said. “I was imprisoned with him in that room in 2002 and in 2006 as well. There’s a lot of dead time between meetings. A lot of times, Peter and I would be in that conference room talking. He’s seen me at the table. We have a relationship you normally wouldn’t have.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   MacPhail was referring to the roles he and Angelos served in labor talks with the players union as members of the owners’ committee. Management people who worked with them say Angelos is so glad to have MacPhail that he will stay out of his way, uncharacteristic though that may be. And even Angelos might have to agree that after 10 years, his way hasn’t worked. He wasn’t available to discuss that possibility because he didn’t return telephone calls. MacPhail’s first task will be to find a manager, who will be the ninth in the 14 years Angelos has owned the team and third in the last four years. The Orioles thought they had Joe Girardi, but be opted to pass on the opportunity. No Uniformity in Pullovers Worst baseball fashion trend of the year: the pullover shirts many managers wear instead of regular uniform shirts. The rulebook doesn’t prohibit the shirts — it governs only players’ uniforms — but Major League Baseball could declare the managers out of uniform and tell them to dress right. It’s highly unlikely that managers would want to be like Connie Mack and wear suits and ties, but they have taken their appearance to the other extreme. They are not only part of a team but also the team leader and would be wise to look like their players. Billy Martin, Earl Weaver and Sparky Anderson would never have worn the pullovers. “I like people wearing uniforms,” Commissioner Bud Selig said. “It’s something we need to talk about. Being in a proper uniform is important.” It’s Time to Sign Negro Leaguers Dave Winfield has such a good idea, Major League Baseball will surely find something wrong with it. Winfield, a Hall of Famer, wants baseball to take a huge symbolic step and sign living Negro leagues players to major league contracts. “The only right thing to do for these men would be for Major League Baseball and the players association to make all the remaining living players major leaguers, if but for a day,” Winfield said in remarks prepared for delivery at a luncheon in San Diego yesterday honoring blacks and Hispanics who played in the Negro leagues.

Baseball is now long past that era. We are now in the 21st century. Baseball has long ago put an end to the thought of separation and exclusion, as noted by the fact that M.L.B. is now over one-third minority and people from other countries.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Winfield, who is a vice president for the Padres, said the players being honored “created the opportunities for anyone of color or from any part of the world to play major league baseball today,” setting the stage for players like Ichiro Suzuki, Daisuke Matsuzaka, David Ortiz and hundreds of others. “The time is right to connect the past with our present while these men can enjoy it,” Winfield said. “The bridge building and good will that will be generated between baseball, countries, cultures and communities right here in the United States is undeniable. We’ve denied these men this opportunity too long.” To make these players major leaguers, not Negro leaguers, baseball and the union would have to agree to waive the rule on 40-man roster limits so teams wouldn’t have to remove players from their rosters to make room for the added players. Owners and players have agreed on so many things in recent years; this one should be easy. “Change their lives forever,” Winfield said. “M.L.B. could do the right thing with these men.” $102 Million on Disabled List After the 2005 season J. P. Ricciardi, the Toronto general manager, had money to spend, and did he spend it. He paid B. J. Ryan $47 million for five years to be the Blue Jays’ closer, and a week later he gave A. J. Burnett $55 million for five years to join the starting rotation. That $102 million is now on the disabled list, Ryan finished for the season after reconstructive elbow surgery and Burnett on the D.L. for the ninth time in his nine-year career and the third time in less than a season and a half with Toronto. It was Ryan’s elbow injury that prompted Ricciardi to utter one of the most remarkable comments of the year. When Ryan missed time in spring training, Ricciardi attributed it to a sore back. A month later he had to acknowledge the problem was Ryan’s elbow. On his Toronto radio show, Ricciardi admitted his lie but excused it. “They’re not lies,” he said, “if we know the truth.” Jones and Lugo Hit Lows Julio Lugo and Andruw Jones are waging a fierce fight to have the major leagues’ lowest average with the most times at bat. Jones, Atlanta’s center fielder, was hitless in two at-bats yesterdayday, extending his current hitless streak to 24 at-bats and dropping  to .198. Lugo, Boston’s shortstop,  did not get a  hit in four at-bats Friday night, extending his hitless streak to 20 at-bats. He was also batting .198 before last night’s game.

Ignoring the benefit of hindsight, ESPN’s “Baseball Tonight” celebrated Sammy Sosa’s 600th home run Wednesday night and never dared whisper the word steroids. “What he’s done tonight solidifies his name into the Hall of Fame,” the analyst Fernando Viña said. Scott Reiss, the program’s anchor, said, “Does this cement his ticket to Cooperstown?” John Kruk responded emphatically: “Absolutely. You know, the asterisk thing. Everyone wants to talk about the negative part of baseball, the negative part of Sammy Sosa’s career, Barry Bonds. They’re Hall of Famers. There’s no getting around it.” That’s as close as they came to hinting that there might be something questionable about Sosa’s career. And before he was finished, Kruk added, “Whenever he retires, he’s going to be at Cooperstown making another speech.” Were these guys watching when the Hall of Fame announced the results of the most recent voting? In case they missed it, Mark McGwire, Sosa’s partner in the scintillating but perhaps chemically aided 1998 home run race, received an underwhelming 23.5 percent of the votes. Given his unconvincing performance at a Congressional hearing in March 2005, when he professed to have a language problem, Sosa faces similar treatment. Not from ESPN, though. Tim Kurkjian, the lone journalist on the “Baseball Tonight” crew, noted that Sosa owned three of the eight 60-homer seasons in major league history. Kurkjian could have wondered out loud how a player who had never hit more than 40 home runs in a season was suddenly able to slug more than 60 three times in four years. But he didn’t. No one else on the show wondered anything, either. They all just celebrated.
