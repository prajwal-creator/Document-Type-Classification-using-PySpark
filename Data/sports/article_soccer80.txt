Credit David Goldman for The New York Times     He was an outsider from Cleveland who became one of those unforgettable New York characters: deep-pocketed and domineering, a victory-at-all-costs cutthroat, not shy about twisting arms — or the law. But he delivered: 11 American League pennants, 7 World Series championships. And as the years passed, it turned out that he even had something of a soft side, difficult as it was to see or believe. And so, when George  Steinbrenner  died on Tuesday at age 80 , he got a typical New York send-off: good riddance and God bless, accompanied by applause and anger. “George and I had our differences, but who didn’t?” said Yogi Berra, the Hall of Fame Yankees catcher whom Mr. Steinbrenner fired as the team’s manager 16 games into the 1985 season — and who refused to return to Yankee Stadium until Mr. Steinbrenner apologized, which he finally did, 14 years later. But that was not all Mr. Berra had to say on Tuesday: “He built the Yankees into champions, and that’s something nobody can ever deny.”  Photo        George Steinbrenner in his box before a Yankees-Red Sox game on June 16, 1982.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Fans and people who could not care less about baseball all remembered Mr. Steinbrenner’s seemingly Falstaffian performances on the New York public stage, especially in the 1970s and ’80s. They remembered his bombast and bluster. They remembered the charisma when he turned on the charm and the near-nuclear fallout when he did not. They remembered how he churned through managers and, for a while, general managers, faster than soap operas cycle through marriages and divorces. There were those who said he had landed in the wrong sport, what with his Knute Rockne-esque philosophy of winning. “Who else could be a memorable character on a television show without actually appearing on the show?” asked Jerry Seinfeld, whose show it was. “You felt George even though he wasn’t there. That’s how huge a force of personality he was.” New Yorkers remembered his presence around the city, and not just in the parking lot at Yankee Stadium or, later, in his skybox: how he had a suite on the seventh floor of the Regency — one living room, two bedrooms and three bathrooms; how he kept a life-size cardboard cutout of John Wayne holding a rifle in the suite; how he became a regular at Elaine’s, the Upper East Side hangout for people whose names are inevitably printed in boldface.

Clarke’s and Studio 54 — this was the ’70s, remember — and soccer games on Randalls Island; how he was soon moving in a circle that included the gravelly voiced ice cream mogul Tom Carvel ; how he always sat at Table 12 at the “21” Club and Table 11 at Fresco by Scotto, on East 52nd Street, where, they say, he worked out the deals for the likes of Hideki Matsui, Randy Johnson, Jorge Posada and Jason Giambi. “I was a Brooklyn Dodgers fan forever, but he was a great New Yorker,” said former Mayor David N. Dinkins. “He obviously built that franchise from, I don’t know, $9 million or $10 million into billions. And he did it his way.” (In fact, the syndicate led by Mr. Steinbrenner paid $10 million when it bought the Yankees from CBS.) Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called Mr. Steinbrenner “a quintessential New Yorker” and said that “his deep respect and appreciation for talent and hard work” had made him successful. And Senator Charles E. Schumer introduced a resolution on Capitol Hill to commemorate Mr. Steinbrenner and his contributions to the city and to baseball. Mr. Steinbrenner was not completely new to New York when he took over the Yankees. Brendan T. Byrne, a former governor of New Jersey, said that Mr. Steinbrenner had backed “Applause,” a Broadway show that starred Lauren Bacall and opened in 1970. Mr. Byrne remembered meeting him on opening night.

Jonathan Mahler, the author of “Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning,” said that by the time Mr. Steinbrenner took over, the Grand Concourse — once described as the Champs-Élysées of New York, with Yankee Stadium as its Arc de Triomphe — was in ruins. Arson was costing 10 square blocks, or about 5,000 units of housing, every year.

Credit Bill Cooke/Associated Press    “New York City revived around the team,” Mr. Mahler said. “I don’t think you can look at the recovery of New York from the 1970s without, on some level, talking about Steinbrenner. Even if you’re just talking about the feel of the city, he was part of a creation of a new sense of optimism.” Mr. Mahler mentioned Mr. Steinbrenner in the same breath as Rupert Murdoch, who bought The New York Post a few years after Mr. Steinbrenner took control of the Yankees, as “this new breed of New Yorker who helped revive the city” in the ’70s — hands-on executives “who were not entirely sympathetic people, but who were important forces in bringing life back to New York.” Along the way Mr. Steinbrenner became almost a caricature — not just the boss, but the imperious despot. “A hard bargainer,” said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, recalling negotiations over the Yankees’ stadium lease — a lease Mr. Koch said Mr. Steinbrenner refused to sign for years. “I didn’t think that was gentlemanly among sports people,” he said. “It’s how you play the game, not winning. But business acumen he had, no question about it.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address.

Mr. Dinkins draped a Yankees jacket on Mr. Mandela’s shoulders and put a Yankees cap on his head. Mr. Dinkins said on Tuesday that Mr. Steinbrenner loved that moment. “Steinbrenner was so delighted with Nelson Mandela putting on the cap and the jacket that he said something like he would cover all of our expenses for that day,” Mr. Dinkins recalled. The offer mattered, Mr. Dinkins said, because the event was to have been paid for with private donations, not money from the city.   Andrew Boryga, Emily B.
