During that minute, Akers remembered that Coach  Jack Hartman retired from Kansas State 10 years ago, full of glory. She also had a painful flashback: She saw herself skulking along a public hallway that ran above the gym, flattening herself against a bathroom door and peering down through an iron fence at Hartman's closed Wildcat practices. He was a great coach, and she had wanted to learn his techniques for penetrating zone defenses  so she could teach them to her Wildkittens. The sportscaster returned to announce that in the wake of an investigation of the coach of the K-State women's team, the great Coach Hartman, 69 years old, survivor of two recent heart bypass operations, was heroically coming back to help out his university and coach the ladies. When Judy Akers heard that, she lost her breath. Akers quit coaching in 1980, whipped by too many battles over shabby uniforms, 6 A.M. practice times, lack of respect for her emerging women's program. She even filed a Title IX complaint, and when that was dismissed she knew she was finished at K-State, if not everywhere under the hoop. She would never be given the chance to fight for the opportunities routinely granted to her role model, Jack Hartman. And Hartman was part of her problem. The popular and successful men's team coach seemed to think that women had no place in college athletics; at the least, Akers and others recall, he seemed to think that women were a distraction to his boys and a drain on the budget. He shooed the women out of the gym, locked the baskets, had the communal water cooler moved into the sanctum of the men's locker room. Akers and Hartman had a few confrontations, but no real conversations. He was "part of the old-boy chain," and so she left coaching, K-State and the state of Kansas, at the age of 35.

He was too busy back then to pay any attention to the women, he says, much less watch them play. Now he is reveling in the excitement and enthusiasm of the women's game.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       "I'm very much impressed, they exceeded my expectations," he said last week,  just back from a 1-1 road-trip to Oklahoma, which held up the season's .500 average. "Kids who play hard appeal to you. They want to win, they are open-eyed to suggestion. And smart. I've got two girls on the Big Eight all-American academic team. "Basketball is basketball, but, yes, they are different from the men. Not quite the ego thing, not so much selfishness. They get so excited, it is really  refreshing. "My motivation is purely the chance to help out the university -- that appeals to you. And I only have to do the parts I loved about coaching, the practices and the games, not the recruiting and talking to the media. I'm just here to finish the season. And winning is winning. I still get the adrenaline rush." Both Akers and Hartman are direct without being intimate in that typical coaches' style, clear in what they want to say and what they consider out of line. Passion for the game rings their words. Akers's memories are bittersweet;  she feels betrayed by the institution she loved. Hartman's are fulsome; he has been nominated twice to the sport's Hall of Fame. That is not to say he can't be defensive ("Don't make this into a gender thing," he said. "I'm no gargoyle."). He is no gargoyle and of course it's a gender thing, a cautionary tale. It is on the shoulders of women like Judy Akers that Pat Summitt and Nancy Lieberman-Cline, Rebecca Lobo and Chamique Holdsclaw stand; to forget her is to  forget history. In her patch of America, she pushed her game forward. As did Hartman, who inspired generations of his own. In his 16 years of coaching men at Kansas State, Hartman won 295 games and lost 169. He won three Big Eight titles, and four times took a team to the quarterfinals of the N.C.A.A. tournament. He developed such professional players as Chuckie Williams, Rolando Blackman, Eddie Nealy and Mike Evans, who, when told last week that his old coach was coaching women, said, "Getouttahere!", and then, "Is this some kind of April Fool's?" Assured it was not, Evans, a former Denver Nuggets player and coach, who is now broadcasting the team's games, laughed and said: "It's bizarre, it seems like the last thing he'd do. He was always kicking them out of the gym. But I don't think he was sexist. There was never any discussion about women at all. He didn't want them distracting us, the same way he threw the men's track team out  of the gym.

I came from a religious background, and I liked it. Basketball was the biggest thing at K-State then; the football coach brought recruits to watch us play. It was magical. The crowd made so much  noise you couldn't hear the ball dribbling on the floor. I didn't hear that kind of crowd noise again until the Nuggets made the playoffs against Utah.

The women's team that Judy Akers created in the 1960's and 1970's went from six players with a rover to five players, fullcourt; from "extramural" games to  varsity schedules; from T-shirts on which she sewed felt numbers to real uniforms; from Wildkittens to Lady Cats to Wildcats. Her teams were perennial winners. Her record was 206 victories, 94 defeats, a winning percentage of .687, which was 51 points higher than Hartman's; Akers feels it is some measure of what "really counts" that Hartman is always called K-State's "winningest" coach. In the 90's, the women's program slumped. Three years ago, Brian Agler was hired; not only did he reverse the losing trend, he reached into the past to award varsity letters to Akers's pioneers in a ceremony held just a week before  he was suspended, reportedly for paying a team member to baby-sit for him. That's what brought Jack back. "I was dumbfounded," said Deanna (Dee) Duffy Hanzlick, chairwoman of "Cat Pride," a group of female basketball alumni. Married and a mother, she also coaches basketball at her old high school. "Judy Akers was a wonderful coach. We worked hard, had fun, learned to respect each other. Other students didn't respect us, we didn't get stories in the school newspaper until one of our managers got on the sports staff. I remember Hartman hiding the balls and the clocks, throwing us out of the gym. "Some of us talked about a sit-in, But Coach Akers didn't want us to fight her battles. I had a chip on my shoulder because I came from a high school where girls were not allowed to run on the track. I had to join an A.A.U. team. My personal feeling is that it was just plain old discrimination against women, part of the culture of the times. Hartman might be a great coach for women now because everybody grows up eventually." Akers, once she started breathing again in front of the TV set, thought it might all turn out for the good if Hartman's presence brought greater attention  and respect to the women's team, which ends its 29-game regular season today. "I have a certain level of compassion for the man, which admittedly doesn't last too long," she said from the Castle Rock Ranch, the B-and-B that officially opens in April. "He saw us encroaching on his territory. The old boys had the illusion that we would kill male sports, that the pie wasn't big enough. Hey, why should sports be different from politics?" Akers has no plans to coach again, although she has not given up the idea. She sees her game on the brink of a positive new era. The battles she fought are hard to explain to a generation that watches women play basketball on TV, uses Title IX as a tool for change, wears a Nike shoe named for Sheryl Swoopes. Akers thinks that the people with power who once gave the Hartmans tacit permission to "take as much space as they could cover" were finally offering women a piece of the pie. "Jack had all the toys and he didn't want to share them," she said. "My heart was broken because my kids were treated as second-class players. You know when I'll know things have really changed? When the men's team gets into trouble and  they call me up, 'Judy, we need you.' "  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
