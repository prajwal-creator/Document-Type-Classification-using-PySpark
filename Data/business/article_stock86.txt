In his final State of the Union address , President Obama pointed to a resurgent economy and to the nation’s improved standing in the world, despite inequality at home and terrorism abroad. And he accepted responsibility for falling short of transforming Washington and politics itself. Here are highlights and the full transcript of his speech. Today, Mr. Obama visits an Omaha high school teacher who wrote him a letter a year ago asking what kind of world her newborn son would face. He hopes to spend much of the next year in conversation with citizens outside Washington, an aide said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   • The next State of the Union.

And Ted Cruz, facing criticism from Donald J. Trump over his Canadian birth, is suggesting that Mr. Trump is catering to Democrats.

Iran released two U.S. Navy patrol boats and 10 crew members who were described as “trespassing” in Iranian waters , state news media said today. The episode came just days before a nuclear deal is carried out , under which the U.S. is to unfreeze $100 billion in Iranian assets. • At the Supreme Court. The justices hear arguments today in a case brought by the families of Americans killed in terrorist attacks sponsored by Iran. The families seek to collect almost $2 billion seized from Iran’s central bank. • Following the money trail.

It’s the first time the government has required real estate companies to disclose names behind all-cash transactions, made by shell companies that often shield purchasers’ identities. • Millions away from home. The U.N. estimates that 244 million people, or 3.3 percent of the world’s population, live in a country other than the one where they were born. But many others cannot leave. The U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Syria says that some residents of Madaya resemble “skeletons that are now barely moving.” • Water crisis in Flint, Mich. National Guard troops could begin arriving in the city today to distribute water filters and bottled water to residents with lead-tainted drinking water . Flint’s problems began after the city switched its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in 2014 as part of a cost-cutting plan. • Largest. Jackpot. Ever. At $1.5 billion, tonight’s Powerball drawing is the largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history. No other has ever broken the $1 billion mark.

Monte Irvin was one of the first outstanding black players in the major leagues in the 1940s, but he spent most of his prime years in the Negro leagues, waiting for baseball’s color barrier to be broken. He died on Monday at 96. BACK STORY It took more than 100 years after the Civil War for an African-American to join the presidential cabinet, and even longer for one to be elected governor. Both milestones happened on this day. Robert C. Weaver was appointed secretary of housing and urban development by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966, and L. Douglas Wilder took the oath of office as governor in Richmond, Va., in 1990.  Photo        L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia became governor of Virginia on this day in 1990.   Credit Tyrone Turner for The New York Times    Weaver, who had three Harvard degrees, was the great-grandson of a slave and an expert strategist in the civil rights movement. “Fight hard and legally,” he said, “and don’t blow your top.” His government service began during the New Deal, when he tried to harness benefits for blacks from the domestic spending programs. Weaver has been followed by 19 other African-Americans in the cabinet . Mr. Wilder, a grandson of slaves, won the governorship in the onetime capital of the Confederacy with 50.19 percent of the vote. History was made only after a recount. His margin of victory lagged far behind those of his Democratic running mates, suggesting that many Democrats did not vote for him. Only one other African-American has been elected governor of a state: Deval Patrick, a Democrat who led Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015. Victoria Shannon contributed reporting.
