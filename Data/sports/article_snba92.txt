Here in the sports arena of junior athletics, the boys are separated from the men, wimps are weeded out from winners and coach is a deity second only to the Highest Power. I should know. I'm a sports mother, dedicated to the care and feeding of the next lean, mean money machines: two young athletes in the making. The functions of a sports mother are simple but physically demanding. First you must always remember your place in the young sportsman's life. One step out of bounds and you're out. This applies most acutely to emotional nurturing. Sportsmen are trained to be tough - to wear pain as a badge of honor. Therefore a sports mother must never attempt to kiss it and make it all better. Nor should she console a losing athlete with the following words: ''You did your best, and what I liked most was your display of good sportmanship.'' Good sportsmanship? Are you crazy? A young sportsman plays to win, and a sports mother must support nothing less at all costs. Like any good athlete, a sports mother must understand her position on the team. While it is all very well to attend sports events - cheering yourself hoarse over every point - a sports mother's first and foremost duty is on the homefront.

When a sports mother remembers her place, she helps the young athlete conserve all of his physical and emotional energy for the big game. Your job may be behind the scenes, but it is still a vital part of the junior sportsman's winning strategy. Here are a few tips to help you prepare for this extraordinary challenge: LAUNDRY. One to two loads a day/per junior sportsman is the minimum requirement. Now is the time to invest in that new hot-water heater (think colossal in terms of size). Supplies to keep on hand include gallons of bleach and industrial-strength detergent. Forget about sissy stuff like fabric softener. Separate whites from colors only if your young sportsman has reached puberty and wishes to use his athletic prowess as an entree into the complex world of teen-age dating.

Grocery shopping requires skill, energy and a 24-hour supermarket close by. As you march through the aisles, consider loaves of bread, institutional-size jars of peanut butter and sides of beef. Snack foods are another area of serious concern for the junior sportsman. Television dinners make a nice appetizer with a side of corn chips and a six-pack of soda. After a game, junior sportsmen like to unwind with a half-gallon of ice cream and a poundcake or pie. Food intake is exceeded only by fluid consumption. During a championship season, expect gallons of Gatorade to slide down your young athlete's throat.

As a junior sportsman will assure you, your financial investment will pay off handsomely when he gets that first $1 million contract and buys you a retirement condominium in Florida. INJURIES. A mother soon learns to handle injuries with the calm dispatch of an emergency-room nurse. A few simple rules pertain to all sports-related accidents: if it is swollen, apply ice. If it is bleeding, apply pressure. If it is broken, apply sympathy - but only in private. As previously mentioned, never break down and cry on the sidelines during a game. If your young athlete is injured, you may applaud as he is carried off the field. BRAINS VS. BRAWN. One day you present your high school athlete with a front-page newspaper article. The article states that college entrance requirements are getting tougher each year, and even students with B-plus and A-minus averages are being rejected by popular schools with good reputations. Your junior athlete flexes his biceps as a tolerant smile crosses his face. ''You see how smart I am, Mom?'' he replies. ''Instead of concentrating on my brain - like every other kid in high school - I've been building my body. This gives me the competitive edge! Everyone knows that Ivy League schools are desperate for athletes because you can't expect a genius to know how to throw a football or take down a wrestler. They might bruise their brains or something. But I don't have that problem!'' He leans back in his chair and points to the only ''muscle'' in his entire body that hasn't been exercised since elementary school. ''Smart, huh?'' Having no reply to this athletic logic, the junior-athlete mother sets a four-pound steak in front of him and continues to ponder how a heavyweight boxer can earn $30 million in 90 seconds but a research scientist needs a loan to buy a car.
