That’s Curious George, hero of H. A. and Margret Rey’s picture book series, who first appeared on the printed page in 1941 and has gone on to star in films, a PBS Kids TV series , a world of toys and now a traveling museum exhibition for young fans. The show, “Curious George: Let’s Get Curious!,” at the Children’s Museum of Manhattan, both celebrates the books and goes beyond them. Created by the Minnesota Children’s Museum , it portrays George’s  exploratory enthusiasm as the very spirit of scientific inquiry. This  may not be quite faithful to the cheerful anarchy of the Reys’ tales, but it works in a context that depicts George’s protector, the Man in the Yellow Hat, saying, “It’s all in a day’s play. ... Children do science every day.” And children do science here. One exhibit, inspired by “Curious George Takes a Job” (1947),  lets them turn cranks to operate pulleys that send a window-washing  cutout of George swinging across a building facade. At another station  they can make a building, loading foam blocks onto a conveyor belt that  sends the blocks traveling along a Rube Goldberg-type structure. The show has exhibits on light and on wind energy,  in which children can make simple pinwheels and wind socks and see more  sophisticated examples in motion. H. A. Rey, who was interested in  alternative power sources, was also prescient in sending George into  space in 1957 in “Curious George Gets a Medal”; a year later the United States launched a rocket carrying a monkey. Here little visitors can climb inside a model of the Reys’ spacecraft.

Fortunately, they don’t stint on information about the Reys’ marriage and creative collaboration . (Jews living in France in 1940, they barely escaped the Nazis.) An exhibit includes their photos, sketches and letters, including a boy’s 1963 fan note saying he’d read one of their books “because Curious George is bad, and so am I.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Well, not bad.

Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel.

It’s a bit like a living picture book. An art that goes back to sixth-century India, it employs representational paintings on banners or scrolls that are made to move with cranklike mechanisms (hence banners and cranks). This festival, presented by the Dream Music Puppetry Program, includes variations on the form and, of course, puppets.

This new series at the Museum of the Moving Image, running weekends until July 3, screens family films with literary roots. This weekend offers older children an opportunity to see a critically acclaimed recent film they might not have caught in theaters: “True Grit,” the Coen brothers’ western based on Charles Portis’s novel about Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), who enlists the United States Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to help her find her father’s killer.

He is Bob Morss, not Morse.      A version of this schedule appears in print on June 17, 2011, on Page C24 of the New York edition with the headline: Spare Times.
