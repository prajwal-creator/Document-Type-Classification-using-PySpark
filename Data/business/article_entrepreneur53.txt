Omidyar and Peter B. Lewis are in many ways opposites. Mr. Omidyar, the founder of eBay, is shy, soft-spoken and formal, while Mr. Lewis, who made Progressive Insurance into the powerhouse it is today, bluntly speaks his mind and revels in stopping people midsentence by taking off his prosthetic leg during meetings. But as philanthropists, both are handing out human resources advice along with the money they give to nonprofit groups, a strategy that underscores concerns by donors and even some organizations’ leaders about the management of nonprofits. “Pretty early on, I realized that when I asked these organizations about management, the response I usually got was, ‘That’s business and we’re not a business,’ ” Mr. Lewis said. “I told them baseball teams have managers, too, but that seemed to have little impact on their opinion.” Human resources is, in fact, the nonprofit version of “eat your peas,” according to a study done last fall of some 3,000 leaders of smaller charities by CompassPoint Nonprofit Services and the Meyer Foundation. Those nonprofit executives, none of whom were from universities, hospitals or large national nonprofits, ranked human resources the most challenging and least satisfying part of their jobs.

And since many nonprofits don’t have a dedicated human resources staff person, managing personnel just sucks you in and takes over your life.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The Omidyar Network, through which Mr. Omidyar supports both commercial and nonprofit ventures, found that charities set goals that often did not match their employees’ skill sets, lacked succession planning and were led by executives stretched too thin. In 2006, Mr. Lewis set up a nonprofit called the Management Center to provide human resources and other consulting services to groups to which he and others donated. He has tangled with prominent organizations like Case Western Reserve University and the Guggenheim Museum over what he considers bad management, but he said he had intended the Management Center to work primarily with the fledgling progressive groups he was underwriting then. “They weren’t so interested, so I finally had to say, ‘I won’t give you any more money until you learn this stuff,’ ” Mr. Lewis said. “I don’t have that kind of leverage with the Guggenheim and those big organizations.” Nonprofit leaders are notoriously prickly about allowing major donors to get involved in how they manage their organizations, but officials of groups that have used the services provided by Mr. Lewis and Mr. Omidyar say they were enormously beneficial. “Many donors say they provide value beyond financial resources, but in reality that’s quite rare,” said Tim Hanstad, chief executive of Landesa , which works to ensure land rights to the rural poor. “But frankly, I could easily make the case that the nonfinancial resources we got from Omidyar were as equally beneficial as the money they gave us.”  Photo        Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, is also a philanthropist.

Mr. Omidyar’s background as a young entrepreneur struggling to manage eBay’s explosive growth provided him with experience he wanted to pass on as he became a philanthropist.

Mr. Giambanco and his team have worked with 47 nonprofits, more than half the network’s charitable portfolio. “The dynamics of a Silicon Valley start-up are not that different from a nonprofit — both tend to have charismatic founders, both are more passionate about what they’re doing than about how they’re going about doing it, both tend to be organizationally flat,” Mr. Giambanco said.

Additionally, Ms. Rottenberg’s husband, the author Bruce Feiler, had cancer, and they had young twins. Omidyar put up $10 million to help Endeavor grow, but required the organization to meet stiff matching requirements for about $4 million of the gift. Perhaps more onerous was the network’s insistence that Ms. Rottenberg undergo executive coaching. “If I hadn’t been going through what I was going through personally at the time, I might have pushed back on that more,” she said. “I did think, ‘Why do they need to put me on the couch?’ ” She now praises that aspect. Mr. Giambanco gave her practical advice that she said had proven valuable. “We had been a very flat organization, where everyone had access to me, and now there was going to be this cabinet of senior managers to deal with and other changes he helped me figure out how to explain and manage,” she said. Omidyar also helped her recruit a management team with experience at companies like Dell, Bloomberg and AOL. “We don’t always agree with them,” Ms. Rottenberg said, referring to the network. “We don’t kowtow. But the services they are offering are really useful, especially at organizations like us where resources are always scarce.” Mr. Lewis continues to support the Management Center, though groups receiving advice have begun to pay for the help. “People in this sector, just like scientists and doctors, get promoted because of their issue expertise and then no one really ever teaches them how to manage,” said Jerry Hauser, the center’s chief executive and a former consultant at McKinsey & Company. “Then it becomes a vicious cycle, where the next generation coming up in an organization comes up under someone who doesn’t know how to manage.” David S. Bennahum, the chief executive of the nonprofit investigative news operation, the American Independent News Network , credits the center with finding a way to manage a workload that had rapidly expanded. “For the first time, we created quarterly goals for the whole organization,” he said. “We had 58 impact stories last year, stories that had real consequences in communities around the country, and it wasn’t just by accident — we worked toward that goal.”   A version of this article appears in print on July 30, 2011, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Philanthropists Start Requiring Management Courses to Keep Nonprofits Productive.
