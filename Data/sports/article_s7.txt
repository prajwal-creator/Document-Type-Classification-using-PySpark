But some au courant sports officials believe it could have a bright future — at the Olympic Games. Plans are going smoothly for a new breakdancing event at the Youth Olympics in Argentina in October, said Lukas Hinder, the president of the World Dance Sport Federation, which promotes competitive dancing events. “We are quite on track with the preparations for the Youth Olympic Games,” Hinder told Inside the Games. “It’s a youth-orientated sport, it’s very cool, it’s innovative, it’s something new.” The breakdancing event will be the debut at the Youth Olympics of dance sport. It grabbed the spot ahead of more traditional dance competitions like ballroom and Latin dancing. The official program lists three medal events : “B Boys,” “B Girls” and “Breaking Mixed Team.” In what must be an Olympics first, prospective contestants were invited to submit a video to audition for a spot in the competition. Rich Colon, 52, a pioneering B boy known as Crazy Legs , was involved in the judging process to narrow the field. The Youth Olympics can be a proving ground for events that eventually wind up in the Olympics. The 2014 youth event in Nanjing, China, included rugby sevens, which debuted at the Olympics in 2016, and skateboarding, which will be added in 2020. Also on the bill for 2018 are a basketball dunk contest, cross-country running, futsal (indoor soccer), and beach handball. The Olympics had shown itself to be willing in recent years to bend the definition of sports, adding sport climbing, for example, for the 2020 Games. But dancing has been a step too far — unless it’s on ice. Though breakdancing has not yet debuted, it has already spawned a dispute, Inside the Games reported. A breakdancer, Serouj Aprahamian, petitioned the I.O.C., claiming that the World Dance Sport Federation, known mostly for ballroom dancing, was not the right group to run breakdancing competitions. It has “absolutely no connection or credibility with any legitimate entity in the worldwide breaking community,” he contended. While there are plenty of breakdancers still out there, to many people it is still an art form most associated with the 1980s. Should breakdancing succeed at the Olympics, maybe the door would open for other ’80s events. Among the possibilities: Rubik’s cube: The top solvers can currently zip through the basic cube in less than 5 seconds. The Olympics would probably want to use the more challenging supercubes, like the 6 by 6, which can take a minute and a half. Hacky sack: The generically named “World Footbag” site reports that the record number of keep-ups by one man is 63,326. That took almost nine hours. A team of two has kept the sack up for 20 hours. Should the Olympics be looking for something that fits more easily in a TV window, it could consider a timed challenge. The record number of touches in five minutes is more than 1,000. Donkey Kong: A longstanding dispute over the world record in the arcade game seems to have come to a close , perhaps clearing the way for a showdown between nations in climbing ladders, jumping over barrels and hammering things. The Olympics might also consider the football game Tecmo Bowl, although whichever nation gets Bo Jackson would have a big advantage. Once people are dancing, cubing and video gaming at the Olympics, the door is wide open. Could a gold medal for best mullet be far off?
