Teams are listed in the predicted order of finish, with the Yankees picked fifth in the East.  AMERICAN LEAGUE  EASTERN DIVISION Seeking a winner in this division, one must find the team with the fewest weaknesses. That team certainly is not the Yankees, who even before Dave Winfield's back surgery had the potential to finish sixth. If they do, it would be their worst finish since 1967, when they were ninth in a 10-team league.  Toronto Blue Jays  1988 87-75, tied for 3d, 2 games out.  Key addition Bob Brenly.  Key loss Jim Clancy.  Probable starters 1b-McGriff; 2b-Lee; ss-Fernandez; lf-Bell; cf-Moseby; rf-Barfield; c-Whitt/Borders; designated hitter-Mulliniks/ Brenly; starting pitchers-Key, Stieb, Flanagan, Cerutti, Musselman; relief pitchers-Henke, Ward. The Blue Jays; their division opponents generally agree, have the best talent in the division, despite their lack of trades the past 20 months. Paper talent, however, does not always translate to a first-place finish, a fact of life the Blue Jays have learned the past few years. The key to their success this season will be the production of the three outfielders (George Bell, Lloyd Moseby, Jesse Barfield), who seemed to take last season off. Manager Jimy Williams made a determined off-season effort to make them happy, and perhaps the psychology will pay off in victories. Fred McGriff (34 home runs last year) could outproduce his veteran teammates.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Once devoid of left-handed starting pitchers (none won a game for four seasons, '81 through '84), the Blue Jays have four: Jimmy Key, Mike Flanagan, John Cerutti and Jeff Musselman. The pivotal starter could be the lone right-hander, Dave Stieb, who pitched one-hitters in his last two starts of 1988, allowing the lone hit each time with two out in the ninth. The pitchers are ably supported by a solid infield defense.  Milwaukee Brewers  1988 87-75, tied for 3d, 2 out.  Key additions None.  Key losses None.  Probable starters 1b-Brock; 2b-Gantner; ss-Sheffield; 3b-Spiers/Polidor (Molitor, disabled list); lf-Braggs; cf-Yount; rf-Deer; c-Surhoff; dh-Meyer; sp-Higuera (d.l.), August, Bosio, Birkbeck, Wegman, Knudson; rp-Plesac.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The Brewers are the popular choice this year, but they have not shown an ability to avoid damaging injuries and they do not have the depth to overcome them. Glenn Braggs is back after shoulder surgery, but Gary Sheffield, Dwight Gooden's rookie nephew, will play short in place of Dale Sveum, still rehabilitating his broken leg. Ted Higuera, the pitching leader, starts the season on the disabled list after having back surgery in January, but he is expected back by April 17. Juan Nieves, another Latin left-hander, has a shoulder problem. The Brewers hope for big years from Don August and Chris Bosio. Dan Plesac, one of the league's premier relievers, is healthy after having late-season shoulder tendinitis. Paul Molitor, the offensive catalyst, who last year was, for a change, injury-free, suffered a dislocated finger and had surgery last Thursday; he will miss at least the first two weeks of the season. If the Brewers stay healthy for the last five months of the season, theyshould contend to the end.  Detroit Tigers  1988 88-74, 2d, 1 out.  Key additions Chris Brown, Keith Moreland, Ken Williams, Charles Hudson.  Key losses Walt Terrell, Eric King, Darrell Evans.  Probable starters 1b-Lovullo; 2b-Whitaker; ss-Trammell; 3b-Brown; lf-Lynn; cf-Williams (Pettis d.l.); rf-Lemon; c-Nokes/Heath; dh-Sheridan or Bergman/Moreland; sp-Morris, Alexander, Tanana, Robinson, Hudson; rp-Henneman, Hernandez. The game is played every year: the Tigers' critics say they will finish well down in the division and the Tigers contend for first to the end. It makes more sense to listen to Sparky Anderson, who says his team will be there when they turn for home. With pitching their strength once again, the Tigers have altered themselves in two stages. First they sacrificed pitching (Walt Terrell) and tried to bolster their hitting by adding Chris Brown and Keith Moreland from San Diego. Then they sought youth and speed, adding Ken Williams (for another pitcher, Eric King), Mike Brumley and a rookie first baseman, Torey Lovullo, who batted his way into the lineup. Williams will play center while Gary Pettis's sprained thumb heals, and Brumley, an outfielder-shortstop, will play wherever the Tigers can fit him in. The Tigers need strong seasons from Jack Morris, only 15-13 last year, and Jeff Robinson, who missed the last six weeks of last season because of hand problems.  Boston Red Sox  1988 89-73, 1st.  Key additions Nick Esasky, Rob Murphy.  Key losses Bruce Hurst, Todd Benzinger.  Probable starters 1b-Esasky; 2b-Barrett; ss-Reed; 3b-Boggs; lf-Greenwell; cf-Burks; rf-Evans; c-Gedman/Cerone; dh-Rice; sp-Clemens, Boddicker, Boyd, Gardner, Dopson; rp-Smith, Stanley, Murphy.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The Red Sox, with Jim Rice showing signs of resuscitation this spring, have such a set lineup they even know who is their designated dilemma: Margo Adams. As Margo goes, so go the Red Sox. The starting pitchers behind Roger Clemens and Mike Boddicker will have some impact on the team's fortunes, but the aftermath of the Boggs-Adams affair could determine the season's direction. Failing to make a trade for Boggs, the Red Sox will settle for having a .360 hitter in their lineup. It is an impressive lineup, with Mike Greenwell, Dwight Evans, Ellis Burks and the seemingly rejuvenated Rice. Any pitching rotation anchored by Clemens cannot be bad, but the Red Sox do not have a left-handed starter, and they cannot be certain about Wes Gardner and John Dopson, or for that matter, Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd, who is healthy following a shoulder problem but who can create other problems.  Cleveland Indians  1988 78-84, 6th, 11 out.  Key additions Pete O'Brien, Oddibe McDowell, Felix Fermin.  Key loss Julio Franco.  Probable starters 1b-O'Brien; 2b-Browne; ss-Fermin; 3b-Jacoby; lf-McDowell; cf-Carter; rf-Snyder; c-Allanson; dh-Clark/ Medina; sp-Swindell, Candiotti, Black, Yett, Skalski, Farrell (d.l.); rp-Jones, Orosco. The last time the Indians finished ahead of the Yankees in a full season was 1968. They could do it this year, but only if they cooperate with the Yankees. By trading Julio Franco to Texas, the Indians acquired a leadoff hitter (Oddibe McDowell) and another strong hitter (Pete O'Brien) to go with Joe Carter and Cory Snyder. However, both McDowell (.247, 55 runs) and O'Brien (16 home runs, 71 runs batted in) have to improve to make the moves meaningful. Jerry Browne and Felix Fermin, whom they obtained in a move of desperation, also do not offer an established middle infield combination. The Indians like their starting pitchers (a mother loves an ugly baby, too). Doug Jones, their great bullpen discovery last year, had a pulled back muscle, but the Indians will not climb without him.   Baltimore Orioles  1988 54-107, 7th, 34 1/2 out.  Key addition Phil Bradley.  Key loss Eddie Murray.  Probable starters 1b-Traber/Milligan; 2b-Gonzales (B. Ripken d.l.); ss-C. Ripken, 3b-Worthington; lf-Bradley; cf-Finley/Anderson; rf-Devereaux/Orsulak; c-Tettleton; dh-Sheets; sp-Schmidt, Milacki, Ballard, Bautista, Harnisch; rp-Thurmond, Hickey. If the Orioles win any of their first 21 games, they will be ahead of last year, the most disastrous in the history of a once proud and successful franchise. In their winning days, the Orioles usezd a lush minor league system and they again have gone to younger players, but progress will be slow. Frank Robinson, for example, will rely on such young pitchers as Bob Milacki, Jeff Ballard and Jose Bautista while taking Dave Schmidt, the only starter over 30, out of the bullpen to be his No. 1 starter. Robinson has no closing relief pitcher, but the team first has to get to the late innings with a lead before anyone has to worry about that weakness. Eddie Murray, with his hefty salary and equally big bat, is gone, leaving Cal Ripken as the only consistently good hitter in the lineup.  Oakland Athletics  1988 104-58, 1st.  Key addition Mike Moore.  Key loss None.  Probable starters 1b-McGwire, 2b-Phillips/ Gallego, ss-Weiss, 3b-Lansford, lf-Polonia, cf-Henderson, rf-Jose (Canseco disabled list), c-Hassey/Steinbach, dh-Parker, sp-Stewart, Welch, C. Young, Davis, Moore, rp-Eckersley.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Perhaps the wrist injury that will keep Jose Canseco out of the lineup for a few weeks is an omen, but is it ominous enough to suggest that the Athletics cannot repeat as division champions? Although repeating is not fashionable these days (Kansas City 1984-85 has been the only repeater in all divisions since 1980-81), it would be difficult to ignore Oakland this year. Sure, it is possible that Canseco's wrist will bother him all season, that Dave Henderson will return to reality from last season (.304, 24 home runs, 94 runs batted in), that Dave Parker will continue losing punch, that Dennis Eckersley will not convert 45 of 54 save opportunities. But it is unlikely that all of those things will happen.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address.

But they have strengthened themselves by adding Mike Moore, a free agent from Seattle, to an already good starting pitching rotation. Canseco's injury opens a temporary spot for Felix Jose, who would like to stick around and become the team's fourth consecutive American League rookie of the year.  Minnesota Twins  1988 91-71, 2d, 13 out.  Key additions Shane Rawley, Wally Backman.  Key losses Bert Blyleven, Tom Herr.  Probable starters 1b-Hrbek, 2b-Backman, ss-Gagne, 3b-Gaetti, lf-Gladden, cf-Puckett, rf-Bush/Castillo, c-Laudner, dh-Larkin, sp-Viola, Anderson, Toliver, Rawley, Smith, rp-Reardon. What's a team to do? The Twins won six more games last year than they won in their championship season of 1987 and still fell short of repeating. If they do not return to the top, they might blame the shortage of solid starting pitchers. Frank Viola has the most victories (93) in the last five years and Allan Anderson was successful in copying Viola's pitching and winning style last season. But despite Shane Rawley's experience, he brings with him no guarantees, and Fred Toliver and Roy Smith are unproven starters who began their careers in 1979 and have spent parts of the last five seasons in the majors. Wally Backman, acquired from the Mets, gives the Twins the No. 2 hitter they have sought, except they need him to improve his right-handed hitting. The hitters who follow Backman - Kirby Puckett, Kent Hrbek, Gary Gaetti - are pretty good against any kind of pitchers.  Kansas City Royals  1988 84-77, 3d, 19 1/2 out.  Key addition Bob Boone.  Key losses None.  Probable starters 1b-Brett, 2b-White, ss-Stillwell, 3b-Seitzer, lf-Jackson, cf-Wilson, rf-Tartabull, c-Boone, dh-Tabler, sp-Saberhagen, Leibrandt, Gubicza, Bannister, rp-Farr. The Royals admittedly put up a better fight against one another last season than against other teams. They vow to change that approach this year. They cannot afford to waste any more seasons because their nucleus of George Brett, Frank White and Willie Wilson is not getting any younger. They added to their age by signing Bob Boone (41) as a free agent; he gives the Royals the best defensive catcher in the league. Some good young players punctuate the lineup, and the group will be even better if Bo Jackson continues to reduce his strikeout ratio (one strikeout every 2.5 times at bat in '87, 3.0 in '88).   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Two young pitchers, Tom Gordon and Kevin Appier, could make an impact, although Appier will start the season in the minors and come up later as the fifth starter. Steve Farr will try to replace Dan Quisenberry as the bullpen closer.  Texas Rangers  1988 70-91, 6th, 33 1/2 out.  Key additions Nolan Ryan, Julio Franco, Rafael Palmeiro.  Key losses Pete O'Brien, Oddibe McDowell, Mitch Williams.  Probable starters 1b-Palmeiro, 2b-Franco, ss-Fletcher, 3b-Buechele, lf-Incaviglia, cf-Espy, rf-Sierra, c-Kreuter/Petralli, dh-Leach/ Bell, sp-Ryan, Hough, Witt, Moyer, Brown (Guzman d.l.), rp-Russell, Guante. Tired of doing it the losing way, the Rangers took a dramatic turn in the winter and shook up the team. They added the venerable Nolan Ryan to their pitching staff and installed a new right side of the infield, Rafael Palmeiro at first and Julio Franco at second. In making the changes, they gave up their No. 1 reliever, wild Mitch Williams, and gave the job to Jeff Russell. Ryan, Russell and the other pitchers, who include another new starter, Jamie Moyer, will throw to a rookie catcher, Chad Kreuter. Jose Guzman, an improving starter, will not pitch at least until May because of a shoulder injury. Buddy Bell, a 17-year major leaguer, is back with the Rangers for a second term, this time as a designated hitter.   California Angels  1988 75-87, 4th, 29 out.  Key additions Lance Parrish, Claudell Washington, Bert Blyleven.  Key loss Bob Boone.  Probable starters 1b-Joyner, 2b-Ray, ss-Schofield, 3b-Howell, lf-Davis, cf-White, rf-Washington, c-Parrish, dh-Downing, sp-Witt, McCaskill, Blyleven, Finley, Abbott, rp-Harvey. The All-Star game will be played in Anaheim on July 11; that's as close as the Angels will come to post-season-type festivities. The Angels have yet to recover from Dave Henderson's hitting heroics against them in the fifth game of the 1986 pennant playoff. They have finished with the same losing record in each of the two seasons since then. Just as last year, they have a new manager this season, but Doug Rader will need a better pitching staff than the one that worked under Cookie Rojas. Rader has two new starters: Bert Blyleven, whose 10-17 record and 5.43 e.r.a. with Minnesota represented his worst performance in his 19-year career, and Jim Abbott, the remarkable left-hander who was born without a right hand. Abbott, who has not played in the minors, beat out veteran Dan Petry for a starting spot. The rotation also includes Kirk McCaskill, who has had arm problems the past two seasons. One veteran catcher, Lance Parrish, replaces another, Bob Boone, who outhit Parrish by 80 points last year.  Seattle Mariners  1988 68-93, 7th, 35 1/2 out.  Key addition Jeffrey Leonard.  Key losses Mike Moore, Steve Balboni.  Probable starters 1b-Davis, 2b-Reynolds, ss-Quinones, 3b-Presley, lf-Leonard, cf-Griffey, rf-Briley, c-Bradley/Valle, dh-Coles, sp-Langston, Bankhead, Hanson, Campbell, Trout, Swift (d.l.), rp-Schooler, Niedenfuer. It is Jim Lefebvre's turn to propel the Mariners to .500 for the first time in their 13-year existence. Seven other managers have tried and failed. Seattle moved backward in 1988, winning 10 fewer games than the year before.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   This year, the Mariners are minus one of their better pitchers, Mike Moore, and they may trade Mark Langston before they lose him, like Moore, as a free agent. The new man in the pitching rotation is Erik Hanson, a 6-foot-6-inch right-handed rookie who had a 12-2 record in his last 18 games for Calgary. Apparently blessed with hitting (though nothing so overwhelming that anyone else has noticed), they traded away Steve Balboni, who led the team with 21 home runs despite playing only four months.  Chicago White Sox  1988 71-90, 5th, 32 1/2 out.  Key addition Eddie Williams.  Key losses None.  Probable starters 1b-Walker, 2b-Lyons, ss-Guillen, 3b-Williams, lf-Pasqua, cf-Gallagher, rf-Calderon, c-Fisk, dh-Baines, sp-Reuss, Perez, McDowell, Hillegas, Long, rp-Thigpen. Like the other woeful teams in the division, the White Sox have a new manager. Jeff Torborg has two claims to fame: he caught three no-hitters in his major league playing career and he survived 10 years as a coach with the Yankees. Can he use those experiences to help his new employer? One of Torborg's attributes is patience, and he will need plenty. He has moved Steve Lyons to second and replaced him at third with Eddie Williams, who was obtained from Cleveland. The White Sox third basemen committed 46 errors last season. Torborg's corps of starting pitchers is a mixture of old (Jerry Reuss) and young (Jack McDowell, Melido Perez, Shawn Hillegas), but it soon could include another young one, Eric King, who came from Detroit.
