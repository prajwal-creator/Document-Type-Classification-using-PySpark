Credit Isaac Brekken/Associated Press     Verizon’s agreement to acquire Vodafone’s stake in Verizon Wireless is a megadeal by any measure: at $130 billion it ranks as the third-largest ever, and the largest since the collapse of the dot-com bubble in 2000. Yet Verizon shareholders seem to have taken the price in stride, even though it is $30 billion more than was rumored just a few months ago. Verizon shares are about the same as they were before rumors of the deal surfaced last week, even though the share price of the acquiring company usually drops. But consider the math: if 45 percent of Verizon Wireless is really worth $130 billion, then Verizon’s 55 percent stake alone should be worth $159 billion. Yet the enterprise value of all of Verizon, including its debt, was $176 billion this week. That suggests Verizon is overpaying. And the staggering price also raises other questions: why did Verizon wait so long to buy the rest of the wireless company? Why now? And why did it ever put its crown jewel, wireless assets, into a joint venture to begin with? “I was advocating that we buy out Vodafone from Day 1,” Dennis Strigl, the former chief executive of Verizon Wireless, told me this week. “The whole issue for us was there was never a better time to buy than the year before. We just kept building more value and, therefore, a higher price. I wish we’d bought it in 2001.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   And Verizon could have bought it even more cheaply in 1999, when Vodafone outbid Bell Atlantic for AirTouch Communications, the company that provided the assets for Vodafone’s stake in Verizon Wireless. AirTouch would have given Bell Atlantic, which later emerged as Verizon Communications, a nationwide cellular footprint to compete with AT&T, since Bell Atlantic at the time served New York and much of the East Coast, and AirTouch covered California and the West. (AirTouch itself resulted from a combination of the wireless assets of the former Bell operating companies Pacific Telesis and US West.)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       According to Mr. Strigl, Verizon’s strategy was always to create a coast-to-coast network. To compete with AT&T’s then-popular nationwide calling plan, Verizon started paying its customers’ roaming charges in areas where it did not offer service. “That wasn’t sustainable,” Mr. Strigl said. But Bell Atlantic dropped out of the AirTouch bidding at $45 billion — $85 billion less than it is now paying just for AirTouch’s former cellular assets in the United States. (Air Touch also owned extensive international assets that were not part of the Verizon Wireless venture.) Vodafone, based in Britain, snagged the company for $62 billion, in what will now be seen as one of the best deals ever. Of course, it is easy to say with the benefit of hindsight that Verizon missed the opportunity of a lifetime when it let AirTouch slip from its grasp. In 1999, the year of that deal, cellular service was erratic, cellphones were clumsy and mostly limited to voice calls, and customers were coping with roaming charges by turning off their phones except when making calls. Vodafone’s chief executive then, Christopher Gent, now looks like a visionary. But he was criticized at the time for overpaying for AirTouch (and other acquisitions that transformed Vodafone into a global giant) and was excoriated in the British news media in 2003 for his £10.4 million pension. (Mr. Gent is now chairman of the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline and a senior adviser at Bain & Company.)

Credit Andy Rain / Laura Rauch/European Pressphoto Agency    According to an investment banker working on the deal at the time (who did not want to be named because he is involved in the current deal as well), Verizon may have underestimated Vodafone’s determination to hold on to the wireless assets because it thought Vodafone was mostly interested in AirTouch’s international assets. “We did bid, but they didn’t want to sell,” Mr. Strigl said. “At least, they didn’t want to sell except at a very high price.” Perhaps Verizon should not have been surprised. In its annual report that year, Goldman Sachs, which advised Vodafone, extolled the benefits of the AirTouch deal and quoted Mr. Gent as saying that Vodafone wanted to move to “global leadership in mobile communications” and that “gaining a strong footprint in the U.S. market was a requisite.” Still, Vodafone agreed on the need for nationwide coverage. So Verizon settled for the joint venture, which was forged in 2000, just a year after the AirTouch deal closed. Vodafone had a 45 percent stake in the joint venture. Even though Vodafone appointed three members of the Verizon Wireless seven-member board and named the chief financial officer, the venture was run by Verizon, with Mr. Strigl as chief executive of the venture until 2007. He, in turn, reported to Verizon’s chief executive, Ivan Seidenberg.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We thought the partnership with Vodafone would bring benefits for both companies. We thought there would be economies of scale, international roaming, better telephone equipment deals. They never happened. We’d have good conversations, but they never picked up any steam.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Verizon came tantalizingly close to getting the Vodafone stake in 2004, when Vodafone thought it had reached a deal to buy AT&T Wireless, a move that would have required it to sell its stake in Verizon Wireless, with Verizon the likely buyer, at a price estimated at the time at about $30 billion. But a last-minute bid by Cingular, while Vodafone directors were sleeping in London, snatched the deal from Vodafone’s grasp, and Vodafone dropped out of the bidding. (Cingular was a joint venture between AT&T and Bell South, and returned to the AT&T fold when AT&T bought Bell South in 2006.) “A few hours made all the difference,” said the banker, who was also involved in that transaction. “It changed history.” Under Verizon’s and Mr. Strigl’s leadership, Verizon Wireless grew to be the largest wireless operator in the United States. (Mr. Strigl distilled his experiences into a 2011 book, “Managers, Can You Hear Me Now?”) Growth exploded after the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the rapid spread of Android-powered smartphones. As Mr. Strigl noted, the paradox for Verizon was that the better Verizon Wireless did, and the bigger the dividends it paid Vodafone, the less Vodafone wanted to sell, at least at any price Verizon would consider paying. “We could never really get them to the table,” Mr. Strigl said. With the benefit of hindsight, Verizon should simply have paid whatever Vodafone wanted, since it was so much less than what it is paying now. “Verizon was always looking for a bargain,” said Jeff Kagan, an independent wireless and telecommunications analyst who has followed the two companies even before the AirTouch deal. “They didn’t want to pay retail. So they waited. If they had just swallowed their pride five years ago they would have saved billions.” The multiyear standoff could have ended much differently. The investment bankers I spoke to this week said that both Verizon and Vodafone had at times considered merging the two companies, and had even considered bids for the other, hostile if necessary. “Both sides thought about it many times over the years,” the banker said. “It was too obvious not to think about it. But the reality is that after you reach a certain scale, you don’t gain anything by getting bigger. A wireless network is really a local tower and the end-user devices near there. When the two companies thought of getting together and tested the logic of globalization, it didn’t produce many benefits.” So why now? Vodafone has said it needs to focus on its core European markets, hard hit by the financial crisis there, and will now have the cash to expand in other regions. With interest rates rising and stocks volatile, the opportunity for Verizon to meet Vodafone’s demands with an attractive package of cash and stock might not have lasted much longer. But perhaps most important, a new chief executive at Verizon — Lowell C. McAdam, who had succeeded Mr. Strigl at Verizon Wireless, took over as Verizon Communications’ chief executive in 2011 — was willing to pay what Vodafone would accept, which turned out to be $130 billion. (Bankers on the deal said Vodafone initially asked for $130 billion plus tax liability, which Vodafone said would be about $5 billion.) Both Mr. Kagan and Mr. Strigl praised the deal, even at $130 billion, with the proviso that it should have been done sooner. “With a new chief executive, with interest rates going up, and with the way the industry is heading, Verizon finally jumped on it,” Mr. Kagan said. “It was the right thing to do, but it was awfully late.” Mr. Strigl added: “I’m very pleased with the deal. I have the same philosophy I had from the beginning: do it now or it will cost you more later.”   A version of this article appears in print on September 7, 2013, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: High Price For a Long Courtship.
