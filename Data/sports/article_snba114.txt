The quarterback throws a pass to the tight end on the 25-yard line. The tight end advances 5 yards and tosses a backward pass to a running-back teammate. He goes the rest of the way for a touchdown. Who gets credit for the 80 yards gained, or is the yardage divided? This is considered an 80-yard pass play, with the first receiver credited with the reception and 10 yards gained. The receiver of the backward pass is not credited with a reception, but is listed in the pass-receiving section with 70 yards gained, annotated with an asterisk and the word ''lateral.'' He is also credited with the touchdown, via receiving, because the original play determines in what category the touchdown is made. QUESTION: Last July 8, in the New York Yankees-Kansas City Royals game, Steve Balboni was credited with the game-winning run batted in, although Don Baylor drove in the third run in the 9-2 Yankee victory. I always thought the game-winning run was the one that won the game, as Baylor's did, or the eighth run in a 19- 7 triumph. Why did Balboni get credit for the game-winner? The rule states that the game-winning r.b.i. is the one that gives a club the lead it never relinquishes. Balboni hit a homer in the second inning that put the Yankees ahead, 1-0. They increased that lead to 7-0 in the fifth inning, and, therefore, never yielded their lead.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Both New York and Chicago are open races, and anybody can enter. In New York, however, because of the volume of entries, the first 8,000 applicants are accepted, and the rest are drawn by lottery. The Boston Marathon requires that men under 40 years of age have previously run a marathon in 2 hours 50 minutes, and men over 40 in 3 hours 10 minutes. QUESTION: When and how did Jersey Joe Walcott lose his heavyweight championship to Rocky Marciano? Walcott was knocked out by Marciano in the 13th round on Sept. 23, 1952.

How many have won three games in a Series? No pitcher has won four games, but six have won three games in a seven- game Series: Babe Adams of Pittsburgh (1909); Stan Coveleski of Cleveland (1920 in a scheduled five-of- nine Series); Harry Brecheen of the St. Louis Cardinals (1946); Lew Burdette of Milwaukee (1957); Bob Gibson of the Cardinals (1967) and Mickey Lolich of Detroit (1968). In addition, two pitchers have won three games in a five-game Series: Christy Mathewson of the New York Giants (1905) and Jack Coombs of the Philadelphia Athletics (1910). One has accomplished this in six games: Urban Faber of the Chicago White Sox (1917).

What were Ditmar's career record and his won-lost record with the Yankees? How old is he, and is he still involved in baseball?  The Kansas City Athletics, on Feb. 19, 1957, traded Ditmar, along with Bobby Shantz and Jack McMahan, also pitchers, and Wayne Belardi, a first baseman, to the Yankees for Rip Coleman, Tom Morgan and Maury McDermott, pitchers; Milt Graff, second baseman; Billy Hunter, shortstop, and Irv Noren, outfielder. Ditmar pitched nine years, until 1962, in the American League, winning 72 games and losing 77 for .483 and an earned run average of 3.98. Forty-seven of the victories and 32 of the losses came with the Yankees. In 1965, he became baseball coach of American International College in Springfield, Mass., a post he held through the 1972 season. Ditmar, who was born on April 3, 1929, is now running a recreational program in a Cleveland suburb.
