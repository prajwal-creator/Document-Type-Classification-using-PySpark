As well as the Queen of Hearts’ constant orders to cut off that precious part, the story offers disorienting size changes, mind-boggling puns, odd manipulations of time and a psychedelic sensibility that’s more 1960s than 1860s. ( Jefferson Airplane noticed.) Translating that celebratory chaos to the stage isn’t easy, but Literally Alive Children’s Theater ’s musical “Alice in Wonderland,” by Brenda Bell (book and lyrics) and Michael Sgouros (score), plays its cards cleverly. Here the White Rabbit (Jonathan Rion Bethea) has a hip-hop as well as a hippety-hop attitude, and the Queen of Hearts isn’t just a royal battle-ax; she’s a drag queen too. Portrayed by Eric Fletcher, she belts out her calls for decapitation like a gospel-powered diva. Add to this a Dodo Bird (Jillian Prefach) with Fran Drescher’s affect and a caterpillar (Tyler A. Rebello) who tells Alice, “You’re killing my buzz, my dear,” and you know you’re not in Victorian England anymore. Preceded, like all Literally Alive productions, by an arts workshop — here to make hats worthy of the mad tea party — the show uses inventive props, video projections and tricks of perspective to evoke the journey. When Alice (the spirited Brianna Hurley , right) grows, a tiny door pops up from the stage floor to emphasize her largeness; when she shrinks, two enormous ones appear on the video screen behind her. Designed and directed by Christian Amato , with sumptuous costumes by Grace Trimble, this “Alice” dazzles the eye. And the ear. The all-percussion score, including a vibraphone, marimbas, a slide whistle and an udu, has as much world-music earthiness as it does lyric gentility. (If only it didn’t sometimes drown out the actors’ voices.) The Mad Hatter ( Carolyn Purcell ) and his mates frolic to a Caribbean beat, and the Caterpillar’s song, “Changing,” sounds like one of George Harrison’s Eastern-influenced experiments.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Including much of Carroll’s sophisticated verbal gymnastics, this “Alice” will appeal most to children over 7. But in Wonderland you don’t have to comprehend completely — just surrender to the madness.

LAUREL GRAEBER For Children ABTKids (Saturday) When children watch ballet, often only the dancers are in step with the story. This weekend American Ballet Theater will offer a program to show young people just what all that tiptoeing around is about. ABTkids, hosted by the former Ballet Theater dancer Kate Lydon, will feature a guided introduction to the art, illustrated by highlights from the company’s spring season, including an excerpt from Alexei Ratmansky’s “Firebird.” At 11:30 a.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org ; $25. ‘Aladdin’ (Saturday and Sunday) The Arabian Nights are coming to Manhattan days. In this adaptation from Galli Theater, young audience members assist the actors in bringing to life the story of the street urchin who discovers a magic lamp and a genie who will do his bidding. On Saturday only, the show is followed by a one-hour theater workshop in which children dress in costumes and put together a short play with the help of the theater’s staff. (Through May 27.) At 2 p.m., Galli Theater, 347 West 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 352-3101, gallitheaterny.com ; $20; $15 for ages 2 through 17. Workshop is $15; $10 when more than one child from a family attends. ‘The Amazing Max and the Box of Interesting Things’ (Saturday) Max Darwin, a k a the Amazing Max, promises not only interesting things, but also some interesting phenomena: levitation, strange appearances and disappearances, props that seem to move on their own. They’re part of this hourlong magic performance, which includes audience participation and has been extended through July 1. At 4:30 p.m., Manhattan Movement & Arts Center, 248 West 60th Street, (212) 239-6200, theamazingmax.com ; $20 to $54. ‘Angelina Ballerina the Musical’ (Sunday) That winsome white mouse who does all her scurrying in toeshoes is finishing her run on Sunday with performances at two theaters. Vital Theater Company’s musical adaptation draws on the books by Katharine Holabird and Helen Craig and the PBS series “Angelina Ballerina the Next Steps.” The show, by Susan DiLallo and Ben Morss, features Angelina and her fellow students doing modern dance, the Irish jig and hip-hop, as well as ballet. At 1 p.m., Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 579-0528, vitaltheatre.org ; $29.50 and $49.50; $89.50 for premium seats. At 3 p.m., Leon M.

Animal Tales Extravaganza (Saturday and Sunday) “Avenue Q” may not be appropriate for small children, but “Avenue Zoo” certainly is — and it has one of the same stars. Kate Monster, an “Avenue Q” puppet, has a leading role in “Avenue Zoo,” a musical that’s part of the annual Animal Tales Extravaganza at the Bronx Zoo. In shows at 12:30 and 2:30 p.m., Kate meets exotic animals and learns that they’re more intriguing than scary. Other highlights of the extravaganza will be a rain forest animal parade, making crafts and reading from dozens of wildlife-theme books. (Through June 30.) From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Fordham, (718) 367-1010, bronxzoo.com . Free with admission: $16; $14 for 65+; $12 for ages 3 through 12; free for members and under 3. Parking, $13. ‘Animation’ (Friday through Thursday) There’s a lot of science in the creation of cartoons, as young visitors will see in this exhibition. Comprising a cartoon museum, a screening room, a studio and several thematic sections, the 6,000-square-foot show, at the New York Hall of Science, allows children to explore animation techniques while learning how math and physics help foster visual effects. Characters and series from Cartoon Network illustrate the principles investigated. (Through Sept. 2.) Museum hours: Fridays, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Mondays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 699-0005, nysci.org .

Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show, for ages 3 to 10, also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. From 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8 p.m. on Thursdays; 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ; free with admission: $12; $10 for 65+; $7.50 for students; free for under 12 and members. Arctic Blast Children’s Festival (Saturday and Sunday) You may think of the Olympics as offering competition in sports like swimming, gymnastics and track, but the skills being demonstrated — and taught — at this Olympic celebration include the arm pull, the kneel jump and the seal hop. These are some of the contests at the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics, whose specialties will be highlighted at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian’s children’s festival. Young visitors can also see performances by the King Island Inupiaq Singers and Dancers and make crafts like an Eskimo yo-yo and snow goggles. From noon to 5 p.m., 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700, nmai.si.edu ; free. Backstage Tours at ‘The Fantasticks’ (Monday through Wednesday, and Friday through Sunday) The producers of “The Fantasticks” think it’s time to introduce the next generation of theatergoers to their show, the longest-running musical in the world. They have initiated a program for young audiences that will take them behind the scenes after performances, where they can tour the backstage area, meet cast members (Aaron Carter has a starring role), learn how the show is put on and take pictures. And, of course, have their first experience with Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt’s fable about love. Performances are Monday, Tuesday and Friday at 8 p.m.; Wednesday at 2 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Jerry Orbach Theater, Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-7862, fantasticksonbroadway.com .

In Family Matters, the Musical’ (Saturday and Sunday) The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are now onstage in an open-ended run of this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children’s book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it’s rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday at 11 a.m.; Sunday at noon and 2 p.m. (all but the 2 p.m. are sold out); Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 10 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com ; $34.95 to $59.95.

The Laurie Berkner Band, a favorite with small listeners, celebrates all kinds of festivities in its recent DVD, “Party Day!,” and it will take audiences to all of them in this concert, part of its “Animal Party Tour.” Children are encouraged to take their own animals — the stuffed toy ones, that is — to wear on their heads while singing along. Friday at 5 p.m.; Saturday at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.; New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 277-7179, laurieberkner.com ; ticketmaster.com ; $37.50 for regular tickets; limited $100 V.I.P. packages, which include center seats in the first four rows and a meet-and-greet after the show; free for under 1. Discovery Room Anniversary Celebration (Saturday) It’s time to rediscover the Discovery Room, that wonderful nook at the American Museum of Natural History where children are not only allowed to handle specimens and artifacts, but are also encouraged to. Now open for more than 10 years, the room will celebrate by expanding, for one day only, into the museum’s Grand Gallery. Highlights will include investigating live spiders and scorpions; handling actual dinosaur fossils; digging up a model of an oviraptor’s nest in a re-creation of a paleontology field site; and playing games involving biodiversity and nanotechnology. From 1 to 4 p.m., Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5200, amnh.org .

But all isn’t what it seems. Saturday at noon and 2 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 4 p.m.; Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 307-9467, lookingglasstheatrenyc.com ; $15; $12 for 12 and under. ‘Freckleface the Musical’ (Saturday and Sunday) Based on the actress Julianne Moore’s picture book “Freckleface Strawberry,” about a 7-year-old redhead who earns that nickname from her teasing friends, this delightful production transcends the usual themes about celebrating the differences that make us special. It does so with a winning score and inventive comedy, as well as an acknowledgment of the unfunny aspects of its young heroine’s situation. (The run is open-ended.) Saturday at 1 p.m.; Sunday at 1 and 3 p.m.; Manhattan Movement & Arts Center, 248 West 60th Street, (212) 239-6200, frecklefacethemusical.com ; $45 to $85.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Gazillion Bubble Show: The Next Generation’ (Friday through Sunday and Wednesday) Children love bubbles, and this interactive show promises not just a gazillion but also some of the largest ever blown, along with light effects and lasers. The stars are the members of the Yang family: Fan and Ana Yang and their son Deni and others, who rotate as M.C.’s for the production. Audience members may even find themselves in bubbles of their own. (The run is open-ended.)

Written by Mara McEwin and presented by the troupe Treehouse Shakers, this production for the youngest theatergoers — infants to 6-year-olds — uses dance, storytelling and handmade puppets to recreate the experience of a chick breaking out of its shell and encountering other animals, including a rooster, a calf, a lamb and baby birds. Small audience members will interact with the characters. At 11 a.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 715-1914, treehouseshakers.com ; $20.

In it a misguided angel takes Joe Pendleton, a boxer, to heaven before his time, and when his corpse is cremated on earth, his spirit has to find a new body in which to live out the rest of his days. Complications ensue. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; St. Jean Baptiste High School Auditorium, 167 East 75th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com ; $20; or $10 for 65+ and students under 18. ‘Jewish Books Cooking’ (Sunday) They’re not cookbooks, but books that cook — and sing, shout and dance too. Elizabeth Swados, the playwright and composer, first dramatized children’s stories in her musical “Books Cook!,” and now she’s done it again, this time choosing titles with Jewish themes. They include “Afikomen Mambo,” “The Klezmer Bunch” and “Baxter, the Pig Who Wanted to Be Kosher.” At 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., JCC in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, Manhattan, (646) 504-5708, jccmanhattan.org ; free. Kids ’N Comedy: ‘The Horrible History Show’ (Sunday) The class clown gets applause, not detention, at this series, in which tween and teenage comics perform stand-up. At this show the comic theme is history, which, despite all those wars, has plenty of funny moments. (Did you know that Charles I sent someone else to be the groom at his own wedding?) The material is recommended for children 9 and older, but there’s no need to worry about appropriateness (profanity is banned) or knock-knock jokes (these dudes are sophisticated). Reservations required. At 1 p.m., Gotham Comedy Club, 208 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 877-6115, kidsncomedy.com ; $15, with a one-item (soda or food) minimum. Kids Cruise Series Kickoff Event (Saturday) The best cruises are like the one in Maurice Sendak’s “Where the Wild Things Are,” in which young adventurers can have a great rumpus and still be safely home for dinner. That’s what Circle Line is offering in this new series of children’s sails, departing the first Saturday of each summer month. This kickoff event will include the 75-minute voyage to the Statue of Liberty (with a chance to take a photograph there), as well as entertainment including a juggler, a magician and a balloon artist. For this inaugural celebration, the rocker Dan Zanes will also perform. Boarding at 9:30 a.m.; sailing at 10 a.m.; Pier 83, West 42nd Street and 12th Avenue, Clinton, (212) 563-3200, circleline42.com ; $28; $20 for ages 3 to 12; free for 2 and under. ‘Kovacs for Kids’ (Saturday and Sunday) Young visitors to the Museum of the Moving Image this weekend will have a chance to meet Howard the World’s Strongest Ant and follow the adventure “The Kapusta Kid in Outer Space.” But these aren’t part of a science-fiction series; they’re among the works of the television comedian Ernie Kovacs, whose imaginative bits and personas were often family fare. The museum will screen an hourlong compilation of his clips, part of its monthlong retrospective devoted to Kovacs and his wife, Edie Adams. At 12:30 p.m., 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us . Free with museum admission: $12; $9 for students and 65+; $6 for ages 3 through 18; free for under 3. ‘The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe’ (Saturday) If the children of the Pevensie family could travel to the magical land of Narnia through something as simple as a wardrobe, why shouldn’t two hard-working actors be able to play them and all the characters found there? That’s what Catherine Fowles and Robert Gilbert are attempting in Off Broadway Family Theater’s first production, le Clanché du Rand’s adaptation of C.S. Lewis’s classic novel. (The run is open-ended.) Saturdays at 11 a.m., St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, narniaoffbroadway.com ; $35. ‘Little Miss Muffet’s Monster-Sitting Service’ (Friday through Thursday) This Little Miss Muffet, Molly, a descendant of the original, is certainly a lot braver: not only does she not fear spiders, but she’s also willing to go into business with the very one that sat down beside her ancestor. In this production from the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater in Central Park, by Doug Strich and Emily Fellner, Molly and Al, the spider, start a baby-sitting service for infant monsters just as a huge winter storm is heading their way. (Through Aug. 26.) Friday, and Tuesday through Thursday, at 10:30 a.m. and noon; Saturday and Sunday at 1 p.m.; 79th Street and the West Drive, Central Park, (212) 988-9093, cityparksfoundation.org/swedish_cottage.html ; $8, or $5 for under 12. Reservations required; some shows are sold out.

But the young dancers and choreographers involved, ages 5 to 17, also have lots of ideas, which they’ll display in this annual spring show. Their 11 original works will have themes including Occupy Wall Street, the cultural oppression of slaves and the disappearance of the small American farm. At 7 p.m., the Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 979-6124, loco-motiondancetheatre.org ; $15; $10 for children. Material Lab at the Museum of Modern Art (Friday through Monday, and Wednesday and Thursday) No matter how much talent artists have, they need the right materials to create their work. This interactive space at MoMA invites families to explore a wide range of mediums that are reflected in the museum’s collection. The stations in the Material Lab include a drawing table; a collage table; Discovery Boxes, with surprise materials within; Cornell Boxes, filled with found objects, in the spirit of the work of Joseph Cornell; and a digital painting experience using new technology from Microsoft. (Through June 30.) Friday, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 8 p.m. on the first Thursday of every month); Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Education and Research Building, (212) 708-9400, moma.org .

The interactive show, inspired by the Chinese epic “The Journey to the West,” recreates many of the Monkey’s adventures, like fighting the Bull Demon at a station that resembles a video game. Much of the fun teaches Chinese values: cooperation, perseverance, bravery and self-sacrifice. (Through May 2013.) Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; to 7 p.m. on Saturdays. Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1223, cmom.org . Free with admission: $11; free for under 1 and members. ‘8cho Aerial Tango’ (Friday through Sunday) Skillfull dancers can appear to be gliding through the air; in “8cho” (pronounced OH-cho), the members of the Brenda Angiel Aerial Dance Company really are. This Argentine troupe performs suspended some 20 feet above the stage, executing tango, milonga and waltz moves on the walls, upside down and in open space. Recommended for children 8 and older, the show, closing this weekend, is ballroom meets circus, with a band and a vocalist. Friday at 7 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 5 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org ; $14 to $38; $9 to $25 for members. The Paper Bag Players: ‘Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!’ (Sunday) The title captures the usual reaction of small theatergoers to a show by the Paper Bag Players, who specialize in delighting those 3 to 8 with musical skits incorporating their signature oversize props and costumes of cardboard and paper. This all-new hourlong show includes bits about the first day of school and a little girl on a tricycle who’s a superhero. At 2 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 598-0400, abronsartscenter.org ; free. ‘Pinkalicious, the Musical’ (Saturday and Sunday) In Elizabeth and Victoria Kann’s adaptation of their children’s book, the pink-obsessed title character, a little girl, finds out that sometimes being in the pink can be too much of a good thing — especially when eating too many pink cupcakes has turned her pink from head to toe. (John Gregor wrote the score and some of the lyrics.) (The run is open-ended.) At 11 a.m., Manhattan Movement & Arts Center, 248 West 60th Street, (212) 579-0528, pinkaliciousthemusical.com ; $29.50; $49.50 for premium tickets. Power to the Portrait Family Day (Sunday) Children can explore how artists have seen themselves and others, and then focus their own investigation on the faces around them, in this celebration at the Jewish Museum. Inspired by work in the current shows devoted to Kehinde Wiley and Édouard Vuillard, young visitors will draw poses and make collaged portraits. The activities will also include gallery hunts and concerts by the band Jukebox Radio, which will use projections and shadow puppets to highlight the day’s themes. From noon to 4 p.m., 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ; free with admission: $12; $10 for 65+; $7.50 for students; free for under 12 and members. ‘The Red Balloon’ (Saturday and Sunday) Birds and butterflies may soar in the country, but on urban streets a balloon is its own kind of beacon. “Le Ballon Rouge,” or ’‘The Red Balloon,” Albert Lamorisse’s classic film from 1956, stars Pascal Lamorisse (the director’s son, then 6) as he follows the object of the title through the Belleville section of Paris. Now New Yorkers can join the ride, in these weekend screenings through June 3. (Cartoons will precede the showings.) At 10:30 a.m. and 1 and 4 p.m., Canal Park Playhouse, 508 Canal Street, near Greenwich Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, canalparkplayhouse.com ; $7.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘StinkyKids, the Musical’ (Saturday) Britt Menzies, author of the StinkyKids book series, based the stories’ characters on her own children — not because they smelled bad but because, like a lot of little stinkers around the world, they tended to be mischievous. Now Vital Theater Company is bringing their adventures to the stage in Sammy Buck and Daniel S. Acquisto’s new musical, which centers on a wad of gum in the hair and a lot of other tangles. At 1 p.m. (Through May 26). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 579-0528, vitaltheatre.org ; $29.50 and $49.50. Thalia Kids Book Club: Michael Buckley’s Sisters Grimm Series (Sunday) Fairy tales really do come true in the universe of the Sisters Grimm, contemporary girls and crackerjack detectives who are descendants of the Brothers Grimm in this literary adventure series by Michael Buckley. They live in Ferryport Landing, where many residents are Everafters, or storybook characters — Sleeping Beauty owns a coffee shop — and where mysteries tend to arise. At this event Mr. Buckley will discuss “The Council of Mirrors,” the just-published ninth (and final) Sisters Grimm novel. At 1 p.m., Leonard Nimoy Thalia Theater, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org ; $15; $12 for members. ‘Theatresports’ (Sunday) It may involve actors, but it’s still a competitive event: The members of Freestyle Repertory Theater, an improv troupe, break into two teams and perform skits based on suggestions from the audience. Children will not only vote to determine the winner but also participate onstage. At noon, Gallery Players Theater, 199 14th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 595-0547, Ext. 6, galleryplayers.com ; $10 for children; free for adults. Touch-a-Truck Fairs (Saturday and Sunday) Adults usually like their contact with police cars, ambulances and fire engines to be as limited as possible, but children — particularly those under 10 — tend to feel just the opposite.

Youth Theater, closing this weekend, is set in 1977, but it successfully explores topics very much in the news today: bullying, gay rights and the political process. Inspired by some of the experiences of Eric Rockwell, who wrote the book and music (the lyrics are by Joanne Bogart), the show takes place against the backdrop of student council elections at Hamilton High School, where the narrator, Eric, faces bullying because of his nonconformity and gossip about his sexuality. Friday at 7 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday at 2 and 4 p.m.; 15 West 28th Street, second floor, Manhattan, (212) 252-1619, Ext. 128, tadatheater.com ; $15; $8 for ages 16 and under; $25 and $15 for premium seats. LAUREL GRAEBER    Correction: May 19, 2012   The Spare Times for Children listings in some editions on Friday included an outdated entry about Puppetry Day at the New York Public Library on Saturday. The event has been canceled.      A version of this schedule appears in print on May 18, 2012, on Page C32 of the New York edition with the headline: Spare Times: For Children.
