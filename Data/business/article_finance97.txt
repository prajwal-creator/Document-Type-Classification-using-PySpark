Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times     WASHINGTON —  Democrats were adjusting grudgingly to their reduced role in the Senate on Wednesday, displaying some surliness and a lot of suspicion while making the case that they would not be silent or passive players in the new Republican-controlled Congress. In so quickly assuming the role of the aggressors on only the second day of the session, Democrats struck a discordant tone when compared with Republican pleas for greater bipartisan cooperation. Resistance came from the West Wing as well. On Wednesday morning, the White House issued President Obama’s second veto threat in 24 hours by pledging not to sign a Republican bill that would redefine a full-time worker under the Affordable Care Act. The administration on Tuesday said that it also would veto legislation authorizing construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, another Republican priority. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, at home recovering from broken bones sustained in a workout accident, dispatched his deputy, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, to read a defiant statement from the Senate floor.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Reid’s tenor previewed the approach that Democrats intend to take. They see little benefit in making the first few weeks of the session easy on the new majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, senior Democrats said. And they believe the quicker they can puncture what they say is the illusion of Republican good intentions, the better footing they will be on politically.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       “I have no intention of just rolling over. I can’t,” Mr. Reid’s statement read. “Not when the middle class is teetering on the verge of extinction.” Mr. Reid also blamed Republicans for making the Senate a dysfunctional body when they were in the minority and said Democrats would not follow the same path. “The mistakes of the past — the gratuitous obstruction and wanton filibustering — will not be a hallmark of the 114th Congress,” he said. The remarks from the Senate’s top-ranking Democrat were striking because they came just after Mr. McConnell made a speech that was critical of Democratic policies but brimming with optimism about the kinds of bipartisan compromise the new Congress might forge. “We’re only going to pass meaningful legislation if both parties are given a stake in the outcome,” he said. “It doesn’t mean that we will always agree. But together we can commit to changing the way Washington operates. This can be done.” In a gesture to the president, Mr. McConnell said, “If President Obama is interested in a historic achievement of his own, this can be his time as well.” Republicans said Democrats were pursuing this antagonistic course at their own risk. “Why did they lose?” asked Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, referring to control of the Senate. “They feel like for some reason they weren’t liberal enough, they didn’t fight hard enough.” Mr. Graham added, “Base politics has taken over in the Democratic Party . When base politics took over in the Republican Party , we ran into a ditch.”  Video   G.O.P.

Boehner , Republican of Ohio, was forced to quash a rebellion in his own ranks on Tuesday after 25 of his own members did not vote for him for speaker, an embarrassing rebuke.

The federal program, which was created after the Sept. 11 attacks and allows the government to offer a terrorism insurance backstop, expired at the end of the last Congress. Its fate in the Senate, which failed to reach a compromise in December, is unclear. In a closed-door meeting with his members, and again at a news conference, Mr. Boehner said Republicans were going to have “a family conversation” with the goal of “bringing our team together.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It remains to be seen whether Mr. Nugent and Mr. Webster will be given back their slots on the influential committee. “They put the conservative agenda at stake with their wanting to be on television and radio,” said Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, speaking of the dissenters. Republicans also faced more questions about Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 House Republican, after reports emerged over the holidays that he had spoken to a white supremacist group when he was a state legislator in 2002. Asked Wednesday about his speech and his association with David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan and Louisiana politician, Mr. Scalise defended himself. “I reject bigotry of all forms,” he said. “And I think when you see the people that know me best, both here and especially back home, people I’ve served with, including people that I’ve been on opposite ends politically with, who know the truth and know what’s in my heart, they’re the ones who I think speak the best.” Behind the scenes, House Republicans were also crafting strategy to deal with one of the potentially divisive issues they will face: a bill that would finance most of the Department of Homeland Security while stripping out money for the president’s recent executive action that would allow as many as five million undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States. Funding expires in February. They have yet to coalesce around a single approach, though several members, including the Republican representatives Robert B. Aderholt of Alabama and Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, have offered proposals. When the Homeland Security funding bill first came up at the end of 2014, Representative Harold Rogers of Kentucky, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that his committee did not have the authority to withhold money from the Citizenship and Immigration Services — the agency that would carry out Mr. Obama’s executive order — because it relied on revenue generated through fees attached to immigration applications.

However, Republicans are hesitant to take action that could withhold funds from the entire department, fearing it could create a standoff and expose more divisions within the party. “If they want to target immigration to retaliate against the president, that’s fine,” said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York. “But we have to make it clear at Homeland Security, at a time when we saw this massive attack in Paris, that we can’t be cutting funding or programs which would protect Americans.”   A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2015, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: In New Role in Senate, Democrats Grind Gears.
