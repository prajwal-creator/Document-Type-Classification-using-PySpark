Previews and Openings ‘All in the Timing’ (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Feb. 12) Fresh from his well-reviewed Broadway production of “A Christmas Story, the Musical,” John Rando directs the 20th-anniversary revival of this collection of six one-act comedies in which David Ives brings his playful perspective and wizardry with language to matters romantic and existential. The cast for the Primary Stages production includes Jenn Harris, Carson Elrod and Matthew Saldivar. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (David Rooney) ‘Bethany’ (in previews; opens on Sunday) Playing a struggling resident of a depressed American exurb blighted by foreclosures, America Ferrera leaves behind the glitzy fashion and media world she inhabited on “Ugly Betty” in this dark comedy by Laura Marks. Gaye Taylor Upchurch directs the world premiere, which kicks off the 35th season of the Women’s Project in its new Midtown home. City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Rooney) ‘Clive’ (in previews; opens on Feb. 7) After directing Jonathan Marc Sherman’s “Things We Want” for the New Group, Ethan Hawke reunites with that playwright and company to stage this world premiere inspired by Bertolt Brecht’s “Baal.” Mr. Hawke also plays the title character in this modern update, which traces the slide from success to self-destruction of a songwriter in 1990s New York. Brooks Ashmanskas, Vincent D’Onofrio and Zoe Kazan also star in the production, which features live performances of classic American songs. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Collision’ (in previews; opens on Tuesday) The prolific no-rules New York theater troupe the Amoralists return with this incendiary drama written by Lyle Kessler and directed by David Fofi. An incongruous bunch of intellectuals meet in a heartland college dormitory and embark on a dangerous quest to create order out of chaos. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, between Perry and West 11th Streets, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, collisiontheplay.com. (Rooney)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       ‘The House of Von Macrame’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Wednesday) It’s not the stage musical adaptation of “The Eyes of Laura Mars” that some of us have secretly prayed for, but this “pop horror fashion show” sounds close enough. Originally seen as a serialized play at the Flea Theater, this musical follows a small-town girl who becomes muse to a flamboyant designer and is haunted by grisly visions of murdered models that are the handiwork of the Lipstick Killer. Matt Marks wrote the songs, with Joshua Conkel handling book duties. Bushwick Starr, 207 Starr Street, between Irving and Wyckoff Avenues, Brooklyn, (800) 836-3006, thebushwickstarr.org. (Rooney) ‘The Jammer’ (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Fresh out of the Yale School of Drama, Rolin Jones turned heads at the Atlantic in 2005 with his play “The Intelligent Design of Jenny Chow.” After several years devoted to his busy television writing career (“Weeds,” “Boardwalk Empire”), Mr. Jones returns to the stage with this contemporary urban fable set in the hard-boiled world of professional roller derby in 1950s New York. Jackson Gay directs a nine-member cast led by Patch Darragh. Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney) ‘Totally Tubular Time Machine’ (previews start on Saturday; opens on Feb. 9) Every time a new jukebox assembly appears, musical theater purists complain that the form is being dumbed down into elaborate karaoke. The creators of this show thumb their noses at such charges. This immersive experience allows audiences to time-travel through the 1980s and ’90s and back to the present, joining the party of celebrity excess and pop mash-up. (Saturdays only) Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, totallytubularnyc.com, (212) 921-1999. (Rooney) ‘The Vandal’ (previews start on Friday; opens on Jan. 31) Since wrapping up his sitcom role on “The New Adventures of Old Christine,” Hamish Linklater has impressed on New York stages in “Seminar” and “School for Lies.” He follows other actors who have recently ventured into playwriting, like Jesse Eisenberg, Zach Braff and Zoe Kazan, with this enigmatic encounter between a woman and a boy, who swap stories one cold night at a Kingston, N.Y., bus stop. Jim Simpson directs a cast that includes Zach Grenier, Deirdre O’Connell and Noah Robbins. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Rooney) Broadway ‘Annie’ James Lapine’s revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley) ‘Evita’ This just in: Eva Perón is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage’s unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley) ‘The Heiress’ Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisés Kaufman’s revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz’s sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow and — aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey — about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com . (Brantley)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ★ ‘The Mystery of Edwin Drood’ A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes’s Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, roundabouttheatre.org, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood) ‘Newsies’ This Disney musical — adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 — markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley) ‘Nice Work if You Can Get It’ Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O’Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Once’ This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens — based on the 2006 movie — inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (“Black Watch”), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) ‘The Other Place’ Laurie Metcalf gives a captivating, complicated performance in Sharr White’s clever puzzle of a drama, portraying a woman grappling with sudden onset of a mysterious illness at the same time as her personal life — disloyal husband (Daniel Stern), estranged daughter (Zoe Perry) — threatens to implode. Joe Mantello’s nimble direction ratchets up the suspense (1:10). Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (800) 432-7250, mtc-nyc.org. (Isherwood) ‘Picnic’ A torso stars in Sam Gold’s stultifying revival of William Inge’s time-yellowed 1953 play, set in lusty, dusty Kansas. The torso belongs to Sebastian Stan as a handsome drifter whose bare pecs and abs stir deep longings in lonely bosoms. Those being stirred include Maggie Grace, Elizabeth Marvel, Ellen Burstyn and the excellent Mare Winningham (2:05). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley) ★ ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?’ Pam MacKinnon’s shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee’s hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of “August: Osage County” fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) Off Broadway ‘Bare’ Stafford Arima directs this tale of star-cross’d gay lovers in a Roman Catholic boarding school. While the boys try to keep their romance secret, the truth comes spilling out during a school production of “Romeo and Juliet.” Retooled significantly since its first incarnation in 2000, this emo musical has been updated to reflect attitudes toward homophobia and bullying in the “It Gets Better” era. But despite touching moments and a committed cast, the material is too painfully earnest and riddled with clichés to connect with audiences not still mired in adolescence (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Rooney)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Cougar the Musical’ Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of “Menopause: The Musical” and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates) ★ ‘Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking’ Gerard Alessandrini’s essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld’s caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles’ heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Fried Chicken and Latkes’ Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor, stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. Her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor’s Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster) ‘In Acting Shakespeare’ What began as an homage to Ian McKellen’s one-man show “Acting Shakespeare” has become a boisterous, agreeable and somewhat glib tale of acting Shakespeare. The eager-to-please James DeVita charts his progress from histrionics to honesty, interwoven with bits of Shakespeare biography and plenty of dog-eared soliloquies (1:45). Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Grode) ‘Job’ The professionally confrontational Thomas Bradshaw (“Burning”) revisits the Old Testament’s most famously afflicted figure in this short, sharp and joltingly funny work, which lets us see a familiar tale through wise virgin eyes. Benjamin H. Kamine ably steers a bright young cast through Mr. Bradshaw’s unsparingly graphic vision of heaven and earth (1:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Brantley)  Photo        Jessica Chastain and Dan Stevens in "The Heiress."   Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times    ‘Love in the Time of Cholera’ Directed by José Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich’s adaptation of the Gabriel García Márquez novel is pleasing but lightweight. A production cannot live on romance alone. In Spanish with subtitles (2:00). Friday at 8 p.m. only. Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 889-2850, repertorio.org. (Claudia La Rocco) ‘My Name Is Asher Lev’ Aaron Posner’s adaptation of Chaim Potok’s novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place — the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz) ★ ‘Water by the Spoonful’ Quiara Alegría Hudes’s moving collage of lives in crisis, the 2012 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama, is the second part of a trilogy centering on the Ortiz family. Elliot (the fine Armando Riesco), a former Marine injured in Iraq, struggles with the loss of the aunt who raised him and a tempestuous reconnection with the ex-crack-addict mother who abandoned him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com.

That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men’s propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00).

Last Chance ★ ‘The Freedom of the City’ (closes on Sunday) The masterful contemporary Irish dramatist Brian Friel puts a human face on the Troubles in Northern Ireland with this stirring drama from 1973 about the shooting by British soldiers of three nonviolent civilian protesters at a march, which echoes the tragic events of Bloody Sunday the year before. Staged by Ciaran O’Reilly, this drama steadily tightens its grip, from its absorbing beginnings through to its shattering conclusion. The standout among the generally solid cast is Cara Seymour as a stubbornly optimistic housewife and mother of 11 children, living in two rooms with a useless husband and no running water (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney) ‘Glengarry Glen Ross’ (closes on Sunday) The fight has gone out of the boys from David Mamet’s 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning drama of sharks in a small pond. In Daniel Sullivan’s deflated production, which stars an extravagantly gesturing Al Pacino, it’s as if all the competitive fierceness has been sucked from them by some cosmic super-vacuum cleaner. It also stars Bobby Cannavale as the hotshot Ricky Roma (1:40). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Golden Boy’ (closes on Sunday) Bartlett Sher directs a superbly cast revival of Clifford Odets’s 1937 drama about a young man (Seth Numrich) torn between a career as a boxer and his first love, the violin. It’s a richly atmospheric production that cuts to the emotional quick of Odets’s still-vital play (2:45). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) ★ ‘Grimly Handsome’ (closes on Sunday) Weird urban wildlife, funny and expansive language, and three terrific actors: What’s not to like about Julia Jarcho’s latest play, which mucks around in the darkly rich underbelly of the city? The play, part of Incubator Arts Project’s Other Forces festival, has no intermission (1:30). Incubator Arts Project, St. Mark’s Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, incubatorarts.org. (La Rocco) ‘Hamlet, Prince of Grief’ (closes on Sunday) The shortest “Hamlet” you’ll probably ever see, presented as part of the Under the Radar festival: an Iranian production starring Afshin Hashemi and a suitcase full of plastic toys, in a 30-minute contemporary gloss on the Shakespeare tragedy (:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood) ‘I, Malvolio’ (closes on Sunday) Tim Crouch’s solo show, which reimagines Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night” from the perspective of its most put-upon character, improbably finds the sweet (and sour) spot between comedy and self-subverting analysis. This British import skillfully takes its audience into a discomfort zone where laughter rings hollow. Unusually gutsy — and thoughtful — stuff for children’s theater (1:00). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, new42.org. (Brantley) ★ ‘Inflatable Frankenstein’ (closes on Saturday) A sticky, gooey, embarrassing and essential mess, which is what happens when you set about to give birth to something like a monster — or a play. This gleeful hourlong exploration of Mary Shelley’s novel and its descendants comes from Radiohole, the Brooklyn-based company that has dedicated itself to the proposition that art isn’t tidy (1:00). This work is a Radiohole production, presented by Performance Space 122 and the Kitchen, as part of the Coil Festival. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org.

A thrillingly inventive, genre-blending production about the search for lost time, in which puppets, bodiless arms and burning pianos all play a role (2:30). St. Ann’s Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Brantley) ★ ‘Peter and the Starcatcher’ (closes on Sunday) The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company’s “Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.” This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity.

Nicholas Martin directs this surprisingly mild-mannered work from a savage satirist (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)   Correction: January 29, 2013   Theater entries in the Listings pages on Friday and on Jan. 18 about “The Other Place,” at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater in Manhattan, misstated the play’s running time. It is 1 hour 10 minutes, not 2 hours 10 minutes.      A version of this schedule appears in print on January 18, 2013, on Page C21 of the New York edition with the headline: The Listings.
