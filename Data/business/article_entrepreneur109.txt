They seem richer now, more complex, certainly bigger, frequently more refined -- perhaps because so many of the Mars family are listed near the top of the Forbes 400. But at the wildly popular Dylan's Candy Bar, candy bars, though on vivacious display, are only a few of the confections you might either hand out or plea for -- scary Saddam or W. mask in place -- on Halloween. Certainly one of the cheeriest and most colorful shops in Manhattan, Dylan's prompts grins just while you're window-shopping: primary-colored walls, shelving supported by candy canes, Pop Art canvases of famous brands, tables of teenagers (or oldsters remembering their teens) slurping sodas and malts (few places know how to make malts; Dylan's does). Inside cheers you up, too. You semicircle down illuminated, transparent steps filled with every imaginable edible squishy: jelly beans, Swedish fish and gummy rings. A whole wall is dedicated to Pez, another to M&M's of every color, another to Hershey bars; just over there is the latest in French marshmallow art, and on that shelf is a topiary made entirely of Tootsie Rolls. Funniest are either the edible Palm Pilots or Post-Its or a series of Spin Pops -- mechanized whirlers that, with the push of a button, spin the candy so lazy tongues can just lie there. Named after (and run by) neither the Welsh poet nor the singer but Dylan Lauren, youngest of three children of Ralph, another well-up-there member of the Forbes 400 and designer of most of the best-looking things of the last two or three decades, Dylan's is cater-corner to Bloomingdale's, and its 10,000 square feet are very much a product of the Upper East Side. There's even a separate room for kids' birthday parties -- at $60 a head. If Louis B. Mayer defined America for itself in the 30's by romanticizing its small towns with the likes of Andy and Judge Hardy, 40 years later Ralph Lauren gave us -- men, anyway -- an equally dreamy version of our Renaissance selves: natty entrepreneur weekdays, rugged outdoor cowboy or suave yachtsman on weekends. Similarly, Dylan may be presenting a new image to counter our sudden unpopularity in the outside world: we're not arrogant invaders but softhearted lovers of sweets. ''He's not all that interested in the candy business,'' Dylan says of her father, ''but his favorites are butter crunch and chocolate Twizzlers.'' Hers are light chews and red licorice. She's on a whirlwind tour of the store. ''He understood my vision for this was big -- but he didn't oversee the design,'' she says, vibrant green eyes flashing, rich chestnut hair framing the eyes. She won't say how old she is -- ''Mother told me women shouldn't reveal their age'' -- but her recent diploma from Duke reveals that she's in her late 20's. She proudly points out her designs: the playful shopping bags and boxes and clever logo of pink balloons and several of the shop's tabletops, mosaics made from M&M's and gum balls, topped with glass. Didn't this woman get enough candy when she was a kid?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''I've always loved candy,'' she says, pointing to a small exhibit of old boxes of Chiclets, Double Bubble and Butterfinger when they cost a penny. ''Not just how it tastes, but its shape and the vivid color. I grew to see candy as an art form. I thought of owning a gallery of candy and just doing candy art -- and I will!'' she says with determination. ''We're one of only two stores in the world with every single Skittle flavor.'' We pass a counterful of dazzling lollies with holograms magically embedded. All the salespeople are young and smiling and very pretty, and all the women, it seems, wear belly shirts.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dylan's also sells the best chocolate chip cookies outside of David's, the masterpiece from the 80's (and still going strong) created by David Liederman. Wow. Who makes these? I ask eagerly. ''That would be Wendy,'' I am told. Across town on 50th Street near 10th Avenue, Wendy Gaynor, a vivacious 54-year-old perfectly willing to give her age, works frequent 12-hour days to make the David-rivaling cookies at her shop Ruby et Violette, named after her children. In a contrast so symmetrical it would thrill a Palladian screenwriter, Ruby et Violette is, as Wendy says, ''about the size of one lane in a bowling alley.'' And yet, surrounded by vats of refrigerated batter, quarts of imported chocolate chunks and tubs of sprinkles (for Halloween), Wendy's mail-order and online businesses (rubyetviolette.com) somehow thrive. ''This is a real mom and pop store,'' she says. But it isn't. It's a real Mom store, Mom and Pop having split up years ago. ''My grandmother was a baker, about four feet high, and she'd let me stand next to her and watch. Not cook, just watch. I've even got a jar of the last cookies she made,'' she says, opening a jar of white, stiff cookies that crumble at the touch. ''You can't eat them, but I keep them around for her memory.'' She has an open, unforced laugh. ''I was a caterer for a while, then sold gift baskets to Bergdorf's. I heard Dylan walked around with a tin of my cookies under her arm and said, 'We must find this woman!' I'm very lucky -- you could sell anything in that store.'' ''Lucky'' might not be everyone's word of choice to describe Wendy. Six years ago, her daughter Ruby was in an accident on the Saw Mill River Parkway and had to learn to walk and talk again, which she did at the traumatic brain injury unit at Mount Sinai. ''I give them 5 percent of my profits for what they did with her,'' she says. The same year as the accident, her mother died. And a year after she met the man who is now her husband, he came down with cancer. ''The business came to a halt when Ruby was hit. I just said, 'The hell with it,' and closed up shop to help her recover,'' she says without sentimentality. Ruby is now a junior at Columbia, and both offspring help out at the store. Aside from a couple of Halloween novelties -- Oreos and Moon Pies dipped in chocolate and lively marshmallow sticks -- her chocolate chunk cookies are about all that's for sale, 42 varieties, all good, many brilliant. (Yowee! my mouth shouts to me over the lemon-and-white-chocolate, the espresso bean, the cherry.) ''I am the farthest thing from a pastry chef,'' Wendy says, laughing and spooning out batter on a scale (she weighs every cookie for uniformity). ''I made a few cupcakes for Dylan but I didn't like them. She also asked me to do a gingerbread house, so I made one just like her store. It took days, piping the sugar, gluing little chrome candies on it. But I threw it away without showing it to her because I thought, I don't want to make these! Now I just make my cookies.'' They are rich and chewy. She uses all-purpose flour (''whatever they send me!''), unsalted butter and, surprisingly, semisweet chocolate at $1.62 a pound from Canada. ''Lots of chefs know all the science about pastry-making. All I know is my ratio of flour to butter to sugar is perfect.'' And so she calls her basic cookie ''the Perfect.'' The marshmallow sticks are surprisingly tasty -- I don't usually like marshmallow, but the hard chocolaty coating and sprinkles are contrapuntal to the goo in the center, and they're strangely addictive. With these and the cookies, you will make many friends on Oct. 31. If Dylan's is razzle-dazzle happy, Wendy's is homey happy -- family snaps all around, lovely baking smells. Also not a bad image for us to swaddle ourselves in, trick-or-treating as we are with our fingers crossed.

Simmer candy wafers in the top of a double boiler, stirring occasionally (do not let them stiffen). Thread 4 marshmallows on each stick. Cover a square of plastic foam with aluminum foil. 2. Hold a marshmallow stick over the pan and spoon the melted coating over it, covering it more or less completely. Hold over a piece of wax paper and sprinkle with edible decorations -- the zanier and more colorful the better. Insert the stick into the foam. Repeat with remaining marshmallows. Refrigerate until coating hardens. Yield: 12 sticks NOTE: Candy-coating wafers are available at New York Cake and Baking Distributors, (212) 675-2253.

Beat in eggs, one at a time, until completely mixed. 2. In a separate bowl, mix flour, salt and baking soda. Add to the butter mixture at low speed until just combined and add vanilla extract. Beat on medium speed, scraping bowl down, until blended. Do not overmix.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   3. Add chocolate chunks and mix till thoroughly combined.
