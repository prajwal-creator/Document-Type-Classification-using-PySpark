Credit Karsten Moran for The New York Times     On Sunday at 1 p.m., not long after the start of Day 3 of I’ll Be Your Mirror , the musicians in the instrumental rock band Psychic Paramount prepared to begin. They turned on their amplifiers and their fog machines and quickly set off the building’s smoke alarm. The hung-over and tender-eared were just starting to file into Basketball City, the giant sports hangar on Pier 36 on the East River in Lower Manhattan, its backboards raised flush with the ceiling and its floor paneled over with carpet. There was no focal point in the place, and no centrifugal force to create one, until the alarm: an intermittent short squeak, with strobe flashes all around the room. The alarm called the day to order. The band waited, adding its own amplifier hum, and then exploded, as if starting at the highest peak of a very long jam, syncopated drum rhythms rolling everywhere, guitar churning in precise juddering rhythm. I’ll Be Your Mirror is the city edition of All Tomorrow’s Parties , the underground music festival that typically takes place in middle-class resort locations across three continents — Europe, North America, Australia. But despite the spinoff title, everyone just called the weekend’s festival All Tomorrow’s Parties, or A.T.P. — both the name of the British promoter behind it and its 12-year-old flagship events.

On Friday night the canonical minimalist Philip Glass played three of his études at the piano alongside the experimental rock guitarist Tyondai Braxton, on guitar and synthesizer. It wasn’t much to listen to, though they got somewhere with the chopping, frisky Étude No. 10. But it nicely represented A.T.P.’s theoretical openness and possibility — more so because it came right before Frank Ocean, singing his abstracted R&B. Likewise, to a degree, on Saturday: the wounded-buffalo rock of the reformed Afghan Whigs came before the Roots, who played a full-fledged party set, replacing the emotional atmosphere.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       A.T.P. is also new to our city. There have been three in the Catskills and one in Asbury Park, N.J., but what to do about New York? Which New Yorkers wouldn’t choose their favorite bands in the festival and see them more cheaply in other local gigs before and after the weekend? (Tickets for the festival were still reasonable: $65 for the shorter, seven-act Friday schedule, $85 for longer bills on Saturday and Sunday.) Who, from the outside, would travel here to spend 30-odd hours at Basketball City, right next to the on-ramp to the northbound Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive? The second stage, outdoors, abutted South Street, right under the F.D.R. Strong, balanced, vigorous sound — A.T.P.’s trademark, here and abroad. Striking visuals, if you imagined it as a still photograph: all those rusted iron transverse planes, the gridding of the metal fences. But it was under the F.D.R. : noise, fumes, ugliness.

The big room didn’t feel embarrassingly empty for this year’s headliners, but at other times the crowd felt meager. It’s a smallish festival — in general, always less than 5,000 people — but this edition could have used another thousand. The resort-based A.T.P.’s really are parties, with their own secluded rhythm: audience and musicians converging at the pool or the lake or the bar. This city version couldn’t compare, but it retained some regular A.T.P. side attractions — movies, comedy sets, book-club discussions, food trucks, bingo. Moored in the water behind the building was the festival’s third area: the Queen of Hearts, a 400-capacity riverboat, with a screening room set up by the Criterion Collection, the cineaste video distribution company, in the bottom bar. The East River remained calm until late Saturday afternoon. During a showing of “The King of Marvin Gardens” — soon after Jack Nicholson’s opening monologue about watching his grandfather choke to death on a fish bone — and a few hours before a rainstorm, the boat began to roll; the unsettling slow rhythm of that speech, and the feeling of the waves, is with me still. Which was proper. The festival’s best music tried to knock you off your equilibrium. This happened most often on Sunday. The Psychic Paramount got levitating within a few minutes; Benjamin John Power, also known as the English one-man laptop-electronics project Blanck Mass , produced layers of drone, with twinkling rising tones inside of melodic cycles, at fantastic, physically massaging levels of volume; Thee Oh Sees , from San Francisco, played its revved, mutated, scurfed-out garage-rock, controlled and stretched at will by the singer, guitarist and bandleader John Dwyer, who has an intense relationship with his wide-range voice and his gear. (They’re not getting rich, but a tighter rock band you will rarely see.) And Godspeed You! Black Emperor played its three-guitar, two-drummer, one-violin electric dirges for two hours — repeating vamps, clobbering dynamics, in front of film loops of urban decay and antiwar demonstrations. It’s powerful, until it’s grandiose. Several different kinds of soul men, open valves of love or hurt or charisma, came through the festival. One was Charles Bradley , who played on Saturday: an R&B singer in his mid-60s who never made it, and now plays with the analog-religious soul reanimators of the Dap-Tone record label. Mr. Bradley gave himself fully, slowly flapping his arms, screaming James Brown screams, riding on slow grooves. Another, again on Saturday, was Warren Ellis of the Australian band the Dirty Three , who bleeds emotional affect through his violin, playing one bereft minor-key plaint after another, high-kicking and tossing his hair and beard. Another was Ian Svenonius of the Make-Up, another reformation brought about by A.T.P.: a Washington band of the late ’90s that turned ’60s soul music into a kind of alternative comedy. Mr. Svenonius knows his trickster logic; everything he says and sings rests on the line between cathartic pop sincerity and total nonsense. One was Frank Ocean , whose live act is flickeringly strong but frustratingly half-formed. His band, in an under-an-hour, 10-song set, half from his new album, “Channel Orange,” had it together. His drummer, David Myers Jr., was frightening, even when playing simple patterns with open space. But there are emotions in his drifting, ruminative songs that his plain body language, and his cocky but uncomfortable relationship to the crowd, couldn’t honor. And the last was Greg Dulli, whose 15-year run as a singer and songwriter for the Afghan Whigs — they broke up for the first time in 2001 —took indie-rock to self-important, dark-side emotional complexity, as well as back to the black music that once naturally fed it. The band’s been playing again since May, and on one level its set on Saturday sounded strong and surging and complete, including reharmonized covers of Prince’s “Purple Rain” and the Supremes’ “Where Did Our Love Go.” On another level it was an awkward reminder of the early ’90s, when an indie-rock band had a legitimate shot at world-scarfing success, and superemotive, inflated-gesture, hypermasculine songwriting seemed the most honest way to get there. We’ve come a long way since then.   A version of this article appears in print on September 25, 2012, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Festival of the Deeply Untrendy.
