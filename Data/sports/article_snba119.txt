Recently, however, Justin has been located by several of the nation's leading newspapers, two television networks, a nationwide talk show and even German television. The local high school principal, Gene Pike, says he is beginning to feel like a celebrity. ''Actually,'' he says, ''I feel more like a baboon.'' His irritation, however, pales in comparison to that felt by Kyle Burns and his father, Clay, who are slowly developing a bunker mentality over something neither views as worth the fuss. Kyle is a seventh-grade redshirt, a breed of player unheard of in many parts of the country but surprisingly common in Texas, where the redshirting practice has existed since 1952.

At the time, he saw nothing unusual in the procedure, since it had been going on all over the state for 31 years.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       But when the news came out, a storm of criticism descended on father and son, and Mr. Burns has lately taken to shielding his son and himself from nosey strangers. ''It's not that we really mind the publicity,'' he says, ''it's just that it's all been so negative.  Why has Kyle been singled out for this? ''Look, it's a free country and we have the right to do whatever we want, as long as we don't break any rules. And we didn't break a rule.'' That much is true. The University Interscholastic League, which governs high school athletics, passed the ''five-year rule'' in 1952 saying that once a student reaches the eighth grade, he has only five years of athletic eligibility left. The rule was an effort to curb the then-common practice of redshirting high school players. But it left the door open for any student in grades below the eighth to be held back a year, hence the origin of the seventh-grade redshirt. The only league stipulation is that the redshirting cannot be done at a coach's urging.   Investigation Started It was Mr. Burns's misfortune to arrive at this course when the Dallas businessman H. Ross Perot was heading a select committee investigating deficiencies in the state's public education system, with significant attention paid to abuses in athletics. Simultaneously, the league has lately become self-critical and begun to re-evaluate its policies. When the Kyle Burns news broke, several people began asking themselves if redshirting youngsters who were still trying to adjust to changes in their voice was not carrying the state's love affair with football a bit far.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Last week, Bailey Marshall, the league director, appeared before Mr. Perot's committee with a list of proposed policy changes. Included was a requirement that ''any athlete held back in the seventh grade so that he will be bigger and stronger for high school football will lose one year of athletic eligibility.''  No Retroactive Action Kyle is safe, according to Bill Farney, the league's athletic director, who says that ''we couldn't possibly do anything retroactively; it would be illegal.'' ''But we do feel disturbed about that particular case, since the intent was so blatant,'' he says. ''Although it's legal, we feel it violates the spirit of the five-year rule.'' But although Kyle, who plays tight end and middle linebacker, and at 5 feet 11 inches and 155 pounds towers over most of his teammates and opponents, is safe from an eligibility ruling, he has become symbolic of the ills of the system. And his father regards it as a cruel injustice.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address.

Why us? What did we do that was so different?'' Even though in recent years there has been publicity regarding similar incidents in football strongholds around the state, such as Plano, Odessa, Hereford and Belton, several aspects of the Burns case led to the conclusion by Farney and others that the ''spirit'' of the rule had been violated. (The U.I.L. recognizes the legitimacy of situations in which a student is held back for academic reasons, or in which social development has been slow.)  Mother's Thinking Changes First, Kyle's mother, Linda, who was recently divorced from his father, has said that although she initially agreed with the idea, she has had second thoughts and now thinks it will hamper her son academically and emotionally. Referring to his size, she described him as a ''monster'' who might hurt smaller players. Second was Kyle's admission that he undertook redshirting so he would be a better football player as a high school senior and have a better chance at a college scholarship. Then there was his father's remark that Kyle ''wants to go to Texas A&M and play football,'' with no mention of any academic aspirations. Mr. Burns sees nothing wrong in that, and is hurt over the way his son has been depicted in the news media. He is particularly hurt over the painting of Kyle as a monster picking on smaller kids and the original, erroneous report that he would be repeating a grade in which he was a straight-A student.

''Look,'' says Mr. Burns, ''what's the No. 1 most important thing in Texas? Football, right? If my boy wants to play high school and college football, what's wrong with that?'' Nothing, according to many who have exercised the option in the past. One is Spud Cason, a former junior high school coach in Fort Worth who ran a version of the wishbone offense several years before it was adopted by the University of Texas.   Mike Renfro a Case Cason lost 20 games in 21 years before his career was cut short by a bleeding ulcer. He handled several seventh-grade redshirts, including the future Houston Oiler star, Mike Renfro, and his son, Sonny, who went to college on a baseball scholarship and obtained a degree in business. ''I've seen a lot of kids helped by it, and I always made parents aware of the rule,'' Cason says. ''One year can make a tremendous difference in a kid's future. Most of them go to college with no idea what they want to study, anyway, but with an extra year, they're more mature. It can be the difference between being a star and a scrub, and that can be the difference between a scholarship or not getting one. ''And it's not necessarily unfair, like they say. Poor little Renfro was so small he nearly got killed, anyway, even redshirting a year.'' Sonny Cason says: ''It helped me a great deal in terms of social development. It helped me in athletics, too, but that was only part of it. I don't think there's anything wrong with it.'' Mr. Burns points out: ''Kyle is evidently one of those kids who just shoots up in size at a certain time. He gained 4 inches and 45 pounds last year, and now he's uncoordinated. When that happens to a kid, he needs maybe an extra year to develop in other ways, to catch up to his growth.'' However, that is not the view of the U.I.L., at least not any more. Farney says that a rule change will be considered when the league's legislative committee meets Oct. 16. ''One thing we're concerned about is how much this is costing,'' he says. ''It costs about $2,400 to educate a child for one year. Besides, the rule was never intended to be used for this purpose. We don't need this.'' And Kyle? ''I still don't feel that I've done anything wrong,'' he says. ''The kids at school have given me a hard time, but they're entitled to their opinions. One thing for sure - a lot more people recognize me now than they used to.''    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
