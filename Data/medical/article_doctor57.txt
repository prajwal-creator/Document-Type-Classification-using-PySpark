Hari Dhillon (second from left, with Gretchen Mol, far left, Josh Radnor and Karen Pittman) gives a coiled, stealthy performance as the Pakistani-born, well-heeled and thoroughly assimilated New Yorker whose assumptions about his identity are shaken when his complacent life comes unraveled. Ms.Mol is excellent as his artist wife, and Mr. Radnor (“How I Met Your Mother”), Ms. Pittman and Danny Ashok give fine support (1:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, Manhattan, 212-239-6200, disgracedonbroadway.com. (Charles Isherwood) Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times By  The New York Times Jan. 8, 2015 Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current productions, additional listings, showtimes and ticket information are at nytimes.com/theater. A searchable, critical guide to theater is at nytimes.com/events. Previews and Openings ‘Ancient Lives’ (in previews; opens on Saturday) In the playwright and director Tina Satter’s latest work, a collision of 1980s teen flicks and colonial captivity narratives, three students follow their charismatic teacher into the woods. When a male witch appears, a new enchantment begins. Jess Barbagallo, Eliza Bent, Emily Davis, Julia Sirna-Frest and Lucy Taylor star. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-255-5793, thekitchen.org. (Alexis Soloski) ‘A Beautiful Day in November on the Banks of the Greatest of the Great Lakes’ (previews start on Monday; opens on Thursday) Those who missed Kate Benson’s play at the New Georges’ Jam on Toast festival have another chance, now that it is being revived by New Georges and the Women’s Project. The triumphs and catastrophes of a multigenerational family dinner — presided over by the sisters Cheesecake, Cherry Pie and Trifle — receive play-by-play commentary from a pair of sportscasters perched above the action. City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Soloski) ‘Constellations’ (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Quantum theory provides the structural conceit for this multiverse romance from the British playwright Nick Payne (“If There Is I Haven’t Found It Yet”) and the director Michael Longhurst. A co-production of Manhattan Theater Club and London’s Royal Court, the play features Jake Gyllenhaal as a beekeeper and Ruth Wilson as his physicist honey. Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, 212-239-6200, constellationsbroadway.com. (Soloski) ‘Honeymoon in Vegas’ (in previews; opens on Thursday) What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. What happens in New Jersey? Not so much. After a successful run at the Paper Mill Playhouse, this musical adaptation of the 1992 film convinced its producers to take a gamble and bring it to Broadway. The director Gary Griffin deals in Rob McClure and Brynn O’Malley as a pair of young romancers, with Tony Danza as a wily kingpin. Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, 877-250-2929, honeymoonbroadway.com. (Soloski) ‘I’m Gonna Pray for You So Hard’ (in previews; opens on Jan. 20) The playwright and actress Halley Feiffer (daughter of the cartoonist Jules Feiffer) has earned many stellar reviews. But in her new play, directed by Trip Cullman, the actress Ella (Betty Gilpin) is apprehensive about reading the write-ups of her latest show in the company of her famous playwright dad (the inimitable Reed Birney). Maybe some intergenerational drinking will help? Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, 866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Soloski) ‘Into the Woods’ (in previews; opens on Jan. 22) Do James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim’s woods seem a little less populous? That’s because the Roundabout Theater Company has engaged the acclaimed Fiasco Theater troupe to perform the musical with just 10 actors and a piano. Reviewing the show’s run last year at the McCarter Theater Center in Princeton, Ben Brantley wrote, “true to form, the Fiasco team continues to keep things simple, the better to bring out the material’s complexity.” Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Soloski) ‘A Month in the Country’ (previews start on Friday; opens on Jan. 29) Will the stars of water cooler television make for must-see theater? The Classic Stage Company’s revival of Ivan Turgenev’s 1855 comedy features Peter Dinklage of “Game of Thrones” and Taylor Schilling of “Orange Is the New Black” alongside Anthony Edwards and Annabella Sciorra. The director Erica Schmidt offers the tale of a handsome tutor who troubles hearts and minds on a country estate. 136 East 13th Street, East Village, 212-352-3101, classicstage.org. (Soloski) ‘Nevermore: The Imaginary Life and Mysterious Death of Edgar Allan Poe’ (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Jan. 25) After runs at the Barbican theater in London and the New Victory, this biographical musical about America’s poet laureate of all things eerie arrives at New World Stages. The show’s writer, Jonathan Christenson, directs a cast of seven — to say nothing of the ravens, black cats and telltale hearts. 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, nevermoreshow.com. (Soloski) ‘Shesh Yak’ (previews start on Thursday; opens on Jan. 29) The Arab Spring may have yielded to other, more fraught seasons, but this play by Laith Nakli, produced by Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, takes place in those heady days of 2011. Zarif Kabier and Mr. Nakli star as Syrian expatriates coming to terms with their present and past in a New York apartment. Bruce McCarty directs. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, 866-811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Soloski) ‘The TMT Stein Lab: When This You See Remember Me’ (performances start on Friday) Gertrude Stein has been described as a “master in making nothing happen very slowly.” Nothing — or maybe everything — will happen a lot more quickly when Target Margin Theater takes over the Bushwick Starr for a month of short works inspired by Stein. Presumed highlights include Nikki Calonge’s “She Counts Her Dresses,” Megan Hill’s “A Nice Story or We Get It, Gertrude” and David Herskovits’s “Reread Another.” Bushwick Starr, 207 Starr Street, Brooklyn, 866-811-4111, thebushwickstarr.org. (Soloski) ‘Ubu Sings Ubu’ (performances on Sunday and Monday) If feeling a stranger’s bare buttocks pressed into your upper back is more than you’re willing to risk for an evening of theater, think carefully before deciding to see this show, starring Tony Torn and the performance artist Julie Atlas Muz and returning to the stage for a short encore run. But do consider it. Loud, inspired and more than a little deranged, it mixes Alfred Jarry’s scatological “Ubu Roi” with songs written by the experimental rock band Pere Ubu. And it works (1:30). The Slipper Room, 167 Orchard Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, slipperroom.com. (Laura Collins-Hughes) ‘Winners’ (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Jan. 22) Though the government deemed certain institutions too big to fail during the financial crisis, who was looking out for the much littler ones? In Maggie Bofill’s comedy, directed by Pamela Berlin, a single family teeters on the edge of collapse. So the children and pets have to put the clan’s finances and spirits back in the black. Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, 866-811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Soloski) Broadway ‘Aladdin’ Casey Nicholaw (“The Book of Mormon”) directs and choreographs (and choreographs, and choreographs) the latest Disney musical, adapted from the 1992 animated movie. While the familiar formulas are not entirely abandoned, Mr. Nicholaw and the book writer, Chad Beguelin, stuff so much splashy, shticky business into this show that the more syrupy bits hardly register. James Monroe Iglehart stands out as the showboating, scene-stealing genie (2:20). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, 866-870-2717, aladdinthemusical.com. (Charles Isherwood) ‘Beautiful: The Carole King Musical’ This friendly, formulaic jukebox show about the New York-born singer-songwriter might as well be called “Brooklyn Girl,” so closely does it adhere to the template of the megahit “Jersey Boys” (about the Four Seasons). Jessie Mueller, though, is extraordinary as Ms. King, making us feel the connection between a singer and her songs (2:25). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley) ‘Cabaret’ Only a decade after it closed, Sam Mendes and Rob Marshall’s popular, audience-teasing reincarnation of this classic musical feels as if it never left us. Alan Cumming seems to be having the time of his life reprising the creepy, tragic M.C., a role he redefined for the ages. In her Broadway debut, Emma Stone is scintillating as an attention-addicted Sally Bowles (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley) ★ ‘The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time’ Simon Stephens’s adaptation of Mark Haddon’s best-selling novel, about an autistic boy’s coming-of-age, is one of the most fully immersive works ever to wallop Broadway. Be prepared to have all your emotional and sensory buttons pushed. Marianne Elliott (“War Horse”) directs the excellent cast, led by Alex Sharp, and the dazzling technical team (2:25). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, 212-239-6200, curiousonbroadway.com. (Brantley) ‘A Delicate Balance’ Though embodied by the stellar likes of Glenn Close and John Lithgow, the angsty suburbanites at the center of Pam MacKinnon’s revival of Edward Albee’s existential drawing-room drama have the flattened dimensions of specimens under glass. The cast (with the welcome exceptions of Clare Higgins and Bob Balaban) seems to be giving us the play instead of living it (2:45). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, 212-329-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Disgraced’ Ayad Akhtar’s tense, turbulent Pulitzer Prize-winner about the clash between Islamic faith and modern culture comes roaring onto Broadway with a superb, mostly new cast under Kimberly Senior’s taut direction. Hari Dhillon gives a coiled, stealthy performance as the Pakistani-born, well-heeled and thoroughly assimilated New Yorker whose assumptions about his identity are shaken when his complacent life comes unraveled. Gretchen Mol is excellent as his artist wife, and Josh Radnor (“How I Met Your Mother”), Karen Pittman and Danny Ashok give fine support (1:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, disgracedonbroadway.com. (Isherwood) ‘The Elephant Man’ Bradley Cooper distorts himself with self-obliterating grace in this sturdy revival of Bernard Pomerance’s instructive, carefully arranged drama about a freak of nature in Victorian England. But the most emotionally involving performance comes from Alessandro Nivola as a surgeon suffering a crisis of faith. Scott Ellis directs a cast that also includes an eccentric Patricia Clarkson (1:55). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, elephantmanbroadway.com. (Brantley) ‘Hedwig and the Angry Inch’ Michael C. Hall plays an “internationally ignored song stylist” of uncertain gender in John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask’s 1998 rock musical about love and loss. Michael Mayer directed this mightily entertaining exercise in crowd control (1:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, 212-239-6200, hedwigbroadway.com. (Brantley) ‘If/Then’ This new musical from Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey (“Next to Normal”) is a gleaming drawing board of a show, full of polished surfaces and clearly drawn lines. The shiny-voiced Idina Menzel portrays a conflicted urban planner pondering two different roads her life might have taken. The show feels less like a variation on a theme than a dogged reiteration of it (2:35). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, 877-250-2929, ifthenthemusical.com. (Brantley) ‘It’s Only a Play’ Names drop like hailstones in this revised revival of Terrence McNally’s comedy about the anxious opening night of a Broadway turkey. Celebrity performers (including Matthew Broderick and Stockard Channing) sling a lot of mud at other celebrities, sometimes hilariously. Jack O’Brien directs with gusto this fizzy, overlong work that eventually goes flat. While Nathan Lane has left the production to take on “The Iceman Cometh,” Martin Short has taken over his role as a former stage star who is now in a television sitcom (2:30). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, itsonlyaplay.com. (Brantley) ‘The Last Ship’ A shipbuilding town in decline is the setting for this earnest, ambitious musical with a wonderful score by Sting (who is now starring), and a somewhat diffuse book by John Logan (“Red”) and Brian Yorkey (“Next to Normal”). Fine performances — notably Michael Esper as the wayward son and Rachel Tucker as the love he left behind — enliven the proceedings, as does the atmospheric production directed by Joe Mantello (2:25). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, 877-250-2929, thelastship.com. (Isherwood) ‘Les Misérables’ It’s back — again. Capitalizing on the popular movie, Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil’s musical, about the French fellow who steals a loaf of bread and lives to regret it, storms Broadway in a new production. Ramin Karimloo, as the long-suffering bread-stealer, and Will Swenson, as his relentless foe, give sterling performances (2:50). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) ★ ‘On the Town’ John Rando’s take on this merry mating dance of a musical from 1944, about sailors on shore leave, feels as fresh as first sunlight. With airborne choreography by Joshua Bergasse, the production presents a parallel-universe New York where hectic urban life acquires the grace of a storybook ballet. It’s a bustling, jostling cartoon that floats like a swan (2:35). Lyric Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, 800-982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley) ‘The River’ Playing a withholding man in a woodland cabin in Jez Butterworth’s cryptic tease of a play, Hugh Jackman squelches his natural urge to ingratiate and ascends to a new level as a stage actor. Comparable claims cannot be made for Mr. Butterworth’s willfully enigmatic drama, though it has been beautifully staged by Ian Rickson. Expect to leave hungry (1:25). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, 212-239-6200, theriveronbroadway.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘You Can’t Take It With You’ A lot of shows make you laugh. But Scott Ellis’s felicitous revival of Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman’s 1936 comedy about an improbably happy family has you beaming from curtain to curtain. The delicious assorted nuts onstage include James Earl Jones, Kristine Nielsen and the sly comic genius Annaleigh Ashford (2:20). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) Off Broadway ‘Barceló con Hielo’ Marcos Antonio Rodríguez stars in his own sociopolitical drama with ghosts. The plot points don’t all cohere, but this Repertorio Español production offers naughty-word humor and textured personal dynamics (1:45). Repertorio Español at Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, 212-225-9999, repertorio.org. (Anita Gates) ★ ‘Bayside! The Musical’ Attending this bawdy, ridiculous, unauthorized parody of the harebrained sitcom “Saved by the Bell” is a bit like going to a midnight screening of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” given the many inside jokes and synchronized audience responses. Audience members know the material so well because half the humor comes from merely reproducing every ludicrous plot twist and trope from the TV show (including Zack’s giant cellphone, Becky the Duck and other allusions that will be familiar to longtime fans). The other half of the humor is just good old-fashioned raunch, usually playing up the horrifying ways to reinterpret a squeaky-clean children’s show (2:00). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, 212-388-0388, baysidethemusical.com. (Catherine Rampell) ‘The Bullpen’ Joe Assadourian, who served 12 years in prison for attempted murder, wrote and stars in this very funny one-man show about the characters he met while awaiting his trial (1:05). Playroom Theater, 151 West 46th Street, 212-967-8278, stepinthebullpen.com. (Ken Jaworowski) ‘Disenchanted’ In this musical comedy for grown-ups, Cinderella, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty lead a fairy-tale-princess revue aimed at upending their popular portrayals as damsels in distress. But this is feminism light, and when the princesses rail against princes who expect them to do all the housework, the show feels like a girls’-night-out retro rebellion for the suburban oppressed (1:40). Theater at St. Clement’s, 423 West 46th Street, 866-811-4111, disenchantedmusical.com. (Collins-Hughes) ★ ‘Every Brilliant Thing’ A charming alternative to “It’s a Wonderful Life” as a seasonal catharsis for those who get weepy in the winter, Duncan Macmillan’s monologue of a play, performed by Jonny Donahoe, describes a boy trying to come up with reasons to live for his suicidal mother. Directed by George Perrin, this ingenious production offers sentimentality without shame (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, 212-868-4444, barrowstreettheatre.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘50 Shades! The Musical’ When it comes to potential for satire, E.L. James’s she-porn best seller, “50 Shades of Grey,” seems as easy a target as you could shake a sex toy at. That said, this exuberant takeoff handily delivers the goods, barreling along with a score steeped in show tunes, R&B, gospel and Gilbert and Sullivan, and lyrics packed with references to various practices and orifices. “This is real life; this isn’t a book,” says Ana, the show’s heroine, to her tycoon suitor. “If it was, it would be terrible.” It certainly would. But “50 Shades!” is a musical parody, and a very entertaining one (1:30). Elektra Theater, 300 West 43rd Street, Clinton, 212-352-3101, 50shadesthemusical.com. (Andy Webster) ‘iLuminate’ More spectacle than story, “iLuminate” offers technology as its most dazzling star. Conceived, produced and directed by Miral Kotb, a former software engineer, the show employs about a dozen talented, indefatigable young actor-dancers, encased in black suits wired with digitally controlled lights. Performing in total darkness to a score combining hip-hop, jazz and classical influences, they portray the tale of an artist whose magic paintbrush is stolen for evil ends. Much of the action is like a neon comic book, but it does have its magic moments (:55). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, iluminate.com. (Laurel Graeber) ★ ‘Rock Bottom’ The fearless, funny Bridget Everett bares it all, and then some, in this cabaret-style show, returning to Joe’s Pub after a short run there in the fall. Sex and booze, and Ms. Everett’s tumultuous experience with both, are prominent themes in this R-rated evening, directed by Scott Wittman and featuring ribald songs by Ms. Everett, Mr. Wittman and his writing partner Marc Shaiman, both of “Hairspray,” as well as Adam Horovitz and Matt Ray (1:35). Joe’s Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, joespub.com. (Isherwood) ‘Sex Tips for Straight Women From a Gay Man’ Matt Murphy’s one-act is a blend of a bachelorette party at Chippendales and the embarrassing midnight show at some tourist trap in Pigalle. It has a talented cast, but it is no “Queer Eye” (1:20). 777 Theater, 777 Eighth Avenue, at 47th Street, 888-841-4111, sextipsplay.com. (Gates) ‘Soul Doctor’ This musical odyssey — which has returned to the stage after a short run on Broadway — examines the life of “The Singing Rabbi,” Shlomo Carlebach, a key figure in popular Jewish music, and his friendship with Nina Simone. Directed by Mindy Cooper, the show has a book by Daniel S. Wise and lyrics by David Schechter. Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) ‘Wiesenthal’ This interesting though occasionally long-winded one-man show (written by and starring Tom Dugan) looks at the life of the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal (1:30). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, wiesenthaltheplay.com. (Jaworowski) Off Off Broadway ‘Horse Girls’ If gore and gratuitous, giggle-laced meanness is your thing, Jenny Rachel Weiner’s mad, dark comedy about girls gone wild (for horses) isn’t a bad way to spend an hour. Don’t come looking for nuance (:50). The Cell, 338 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, 800-838-3006, horsegirlstheplay.com. (Claudia La Rocco) ‘My Son the Waiter: A Jewish Tragedy’ Brad Zimmerman’s solo show about almost three decades of working in restaurants while not becoming a famous actor and his Jewish mother’s shame is low-key, half-familiar, half-mordant and pretty delicious (1:30). Stage 72, 158 West 72nd Street, Manhattan, 212-868-4444, mysonthewaiter.com. (Gates) ★ ‘Smoke’ Kim Davies’s play about two young New Yorkers in a kitchen at a sex party is intense, provocative and exceedingly clever, with two exceptional performances by Stephen Stout and Madeleine Bundy. A study of power, it argues that sex is exactly like every other kind of human interaction, except maybe funnier (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, 212-352-3101, theflea.org. (Gates) Extravaganzas ‘Fuerza Bruta: Wayra’ The latest bit of sensory-overload brand extension from the creators of “De la Guarda” is a shiny, ever-shifting kinetic spectacle bent on disorientation. A high-volume, augmented remix of “Fuerzabruta,” this energetic show is rife with not-especially-impressive acrobatics, throbbing music, many-colored lights and high winds from machines set at storm speed (1:20). Daryl Roth Theater, 20 Union Square East, at 15th Street, 212-239-6200, fuerzabrutanyc.com. (Collins-Hughes) ‘Queen of the Night’ The latest and most lavish of this city’s immersive theater experiments includes cocktails, a meal and a circus-style floor show, in addition to any number of possible intimate, eroticism-tinged (but PG-13) encounters with the comely young cast members. The show is not for those prone to social anxiety, but it’s full of gaudy spectacle, with a fin-de-Bloomberg-era vibe (2:45). Diamond Horseshoe at the Paramount Hotel, 235 West 46th Street, 866-811-4111, queenofthenightnyc.com. (Isherwood) Long-Running Shows ‘Avenue Q’ R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:15).

Last Chance ★ Big Apple Circus (closes on Sunday) “Metamorphosis” is the theme of the latest edition of the Big Apple Circus, now nested at Lincoln Center for the holidays. Considering the intimate scale of this troupe, you could say this production starts modestly, only to spread its wings and soar. The company, now in its 37th year, doesn’t only have impressive animals and breathtaking acrobatic skills; it has a lot of heart, too (2:00). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, 888-541-3750, bigapplecircus.org. (Webster) ‘Lennon: Through a Glass Onion’ (closes on Sunday) In this two-man show, the Australian actor John R. Waters (accompanied by the pianist Stewart D’Arrietta) wisely doesn’t attempt a complete impersonation of John Lennon. There are no glasses or beard or mop top here, just an approximation of the voice and a deeply felt reflection of the man. The show amply covers spirited rockers, but much of it explores the darker depths that so distinguished Lennon from the sunnier Paul McCartney. The darkest corners — Lennon’s early abusive romantic relationships and his heroin use — are avoided. (No “Cold Turkey” here.) But the Beatle fanatics sure to see this show won’t mind (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Gramercy, 800-982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Webster) ‘The Velvet Oratorio’ (closes on Wednesday) Combining choral music, found text and slyly written scenes inspired by Vaclav Havel plays, Edward Einhorn and Henry Akona’s new operatic drama tells the story of Czechoslovakia’s Velvet Revolution. What’s peculiar about the piece, whose production coincides with the revolution’s 25th anniversary, is its lack of discernible passion (1:15).
