Move Them to Connecticut.   By GINA BARRECA SEPT. 15, 2002     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           IT isn't exactly news if I argue that WHERE you live makes an irrevocable impact on HOW you live, right? I was born in Brooklyn and my husband, Michael, was born in Jersey City. Now we're both Connecticut lifers (which is what getting tenure at the University of Connecticut, getting married, and buying a house in Storrs will do to you) yet Michael and I are constantly reminded of the ways in which life in our adopted home state differs from the worlds we left. Today this line of reasoning leads to one question: what if the Sopranos took place in Connecticut instead of New Jersey? How would HBO's hit series, which begins its fourth season tonight, be different if the opening credits showed Tony driving north on the Merritt Parkway as opposed to south on the New Jersey Turnpike?

Now wearing a tortoise-shell headband and Tod's shoes, she would be encouraged by her new friends at the garden/tennis/book/country club to choose a softer palate for her make-up, relying less on eyeliner. We'd see her sporting fewer animal prints and more Lilly Pulitzer, less glitter and more Gucci, fewer gold chains and more Paloma Picasso silver (''So much more subtle, don't you think?'').  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Tony, no doubt going to a fine Connecticut salon instead of a barbershop, would be sporting a shaved head, giving him a much more sophisticated look. He would start wearing long-sleeve shirts with the cuffs rolled up -- no more of these short-sleeve knit jobs. And his boat would no longer be named ''The Stugots.'' His ''goomah'' would be a graduate school drop out, not a former stripper. As exotic to Tony's tastes as a Key Lime pie, she would look the way Cybill Shepherd looked in ''Taxi Driver.'' A younger woman who wants to talk about literary theory, but settles for trips to the Cape and Cambridge, his goomah persuades Tony to buy her books on the philosophy of language at the Harvard Coop and, in addition (hey, she's no fool) very good jewelry at Bailey, Banks, & Biddle. The other big change if the Sopranos moved to Connecticut would involve food. There wouldn't be as much. And it might not be as good -- not unless the main characters made frequent trips to New Haven, Waterbury, and Franklin Street in Hartford. Carmela would no longer cook endlessly enthralling meals or orchestrate beautifully choreographed dinners. She would order take-out. She would have the number of the Little Kitchen in Westport scribbled next to the phone and she would always insist on asking if she could have everything made without MSG (explaining, apologetically, ''My family's excitable enough as it is. You understand.'') The Family would be entirely more health conscious. There would be more organic carrots and fewer cannoli, more trays of bran muffins and fewer of baked ziti, more green tea and less ''gabagool'' (a.k.a.: cappicola -- don't bother looking this one up, just go BUY it).

Interestingly enough, Tony's place of work would not have to change in any significant manner. Gentlemen's Retreats -- a.k.a: nudie bars -- cross all borders. The Bada Bing would not have to change its name if it began life anew in the Nutmeg state. At most, the club might need to offer fancier drinks, such as ales made by small brewing companies or designer single malt scotches, but otherwise the seedy, sticky-floor atmosphere could remain intact. As for the rest of them? A. J. would skateboard less and insist on owning an all terrain vehicle, which he would promptly crash on someone else's property. Meadow would go to Yale or Wesleyan.

Janice and Carmela turn down the book deal, obviously, and pledge to volunteer their time at the Susan B. Anthony project so that they could help educate men and women about the need to stop domestic violence. Uncle Junior would be courted by huge numbers of eligible socialite widows, all of whom would insist that he change his glasses and dress more elegantly, but otherwise insist with equal vehemence that he remain exactly the same. Dr. Melfi wouldn't have to put up with Tony because she'd be too busy dealing with chief executives. Artie Bucco would open a wonderful restaurant. His homemade ravioli would be AMAZING, and Michael and I would eat there twice a week. Every week.   Gina Barreca is editor of ''A Sit-Down with the Sopranos'' and ''Don't Tell Mama: The Penguin Book of Italian American Writing.'' She is a professor of English and Feminist Theory at UConn.
