They may want to avert their eyes today, when Stephen B. Shepard, dean of the new Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York, is to name Jeff Jarvis director of the new-media program and associate professor. Mr. Jarvis, 51, has been developing the new-media curriculum for CUNY's journalism program since last year. As part of the core curriculum, all students will be required to take at least one new-media class exploring digital journalism. "New media will be a big part of the school," said Mr. Shepard. "And Jeff is a major figure in the world of citizen journalism, blogging and online journalism." Currently, in addition to consulting for About.com (which is owned by The New York Times Company), Mr. Jarvis avidly posts to his blog BuzzMachine (buzzmachine.com) about news and media coverage.

As president and creative director of Advance.net, part of the Newhouse publishing company, he developed many of the company's newspaper sites. Mr. Jarvis was the founder and managing editor of Entertainment Weekly, and served as a television critic for TV Guide and People magazine. He has worked for The San Francisco Examiner and The Daily News of New York, and was an undergraduate at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwest University when The Chicago Tribune hired him in 1974. New media, he said, breaks down the economic model of the business he has worked in all these years. "This is really the first time since William Randolph Hearst that a young journalist can think like an entrepreneur," Mr. Jarvis said.  TANIA RALLI MEDIA TALK   Correction:  September 14, 2005, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Monday about the appointment of Jeff Jarvis to head the new-media program at the City University of New York misstated the name of his alma mater.
