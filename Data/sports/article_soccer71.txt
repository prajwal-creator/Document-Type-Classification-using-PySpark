Inter center back Walter Samuel twisted his right knee awkwardly in the 48th minute, damaging ligaments, and will probably miss the rest of the season, the club said Sunday. Andrea Caracciolo put Brescia ahead in the 14th minute at the San Siro. The equalizer came in the 73rd, when Samuel Eto’o hit a penalty, his 17th goal in 16 games this season. In the new lunchtime match on Sunday, Alessio Cerci scored his first league goal in the 80th minute for Fiorentina for a 1-0 victory over Chievo Verona.

Joey Barton took a free kick for Newcastle in the 45th minute, and as Arsenal goalie Lukasz Fabianski moved to punch the ball away, Andy Carroll got to it first with his head. Arsenal pressed, at one point having an 8-0 lead in corner kicks, but Newcastle’s defense held on. On Saturday, Tottenham lost at Bolton, 4-2, failing to build on an impressive 3-1 victory against Inter Milan on Tuesday. Blackburn beat Wigan, 2-1; Sunderland defeated Stoke, 2-0; and Aston Villa was held to a 1-1 tie at Fulham. There were 2-2 ties between Birmingham and West Ham, and Blackpool and Everton.

Bayern was up, 2-1, at halftime despite striking the goal posts three times, including a penalty by Bastian Schweinsteiger just before the break. Gladbach scored two goals within four minutes to take the lead, but Lahm slotted in the equalizer in the 84th minute. Fanis Gekas scored twice for Frankfurt, which is undefeated in the last six games and has 19 points. With Mainz and Hoffenheim both losing, Bayern missed a chance to jump up the standings. Bayern was ninth in the league with 16 points entering play Sunday. Mainz fell by 1-0 at Freiburg for its fourth loss in five games, including the German Cup defeat at Alemannia Aachen, a second-division club. Spain Manuel Pellegrini’s coaching tenure at Málaga got off to a rocky start with a 1-0 defeat at Espanyol. While Pellegrini, hired on Thursday, was not on the sidelines Saturday, B team coach Rafael Gil could not keep Málaga’s winless streak from stretching to six league games when Javi Márquez scored 60 seconds into the match. France Saint-Étienne was booed off the field after its first loss at home, 2-1, to Lorient on Saturday. It was Saint-Étienne’s fifth game in a row without a victory.
