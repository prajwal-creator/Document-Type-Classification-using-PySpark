BROWN OCT. 30, 2007     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           Nearly 3,000 colleges offer classes in entrepreneurship, up tenfold in the last 20 years, according to the Kauffman Foundation, which is devoted to promoting  “a society of economically independent individuals.” So which school is the right place for those  interested in starting their  own companies? Fortune Small Business spent seven months interviewing hundreds of entrepreneurs, professors, administrators, students and alumni to try to find out. The magazine answers the question this way: It found that the best places to  get an undergraduate education were Babson College, Indiana University, Syracuse University, the University of Arizona, and the University of Pennsylvania. The best places for  learning online were Boston University, the University of Houston at Victoria, the University of Wyoming, and Western Carolina University. For cross-disciplinary studies, the choices were Cornell, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Wake Forest.

And for family business, the best places were  Babson, Baylor, Kennesaw State University, Loyola of Chicago, Northwestern and the University of Texas at El Paso. DOES PASSION TRUMP ALL? Maybe we have the whole approach to teaching entrepreneurship backward, George Gendron writes in Inc. Instead of teaching the subject to business majors, who then go out and try to find a niche to fill, wouldn’t it be better to offer courses to people who are passionate about a potentially commercial idea — no matter what their major —  to give them the specific skills they need to turn their dream into a reality.

Rather, we chose as our mission to complement a rigorous education in the arts and sciences.” The school only offers a minor in entrepreneurship, meaning that students must take the majority of their courses in other disciplines.

Just  rummage around their Web sites. For example  the London School of Economics site has copies of business plans for companies that plan to offer everything from venture capital consulting to customized takeout pizzas. CREDENTIALS The article is called,  “Do you need a degree to be a successful business owner?” and the author, Jennifer Mattern of J.H. Mattern, a public relations firm, is quick to answer her own question with “obviously the simple answer is ‘no,’ because others have gone on to run highly successful businesses without a formal education.” But Ms. Mattern  makes an intriguing point. “What I hear a lot of people say (usually kids who start businesses at home online, and who haven’t even finished high school yet) is that if so-and-so could do it without college (insert any ridiculously successful dropout entrepreneur here), so can anyone else. What they neglect completely is that the cases they cite are actually extremely rare. Banking on being the exception to the rule is very likely a large contributing factor to the overwhelming number of small businesses that fail within their first one to three years.” LAST CALL Getting (a little bit) mad may actually help your thinking, according to Psychology Today. While “strong physiological arousal has detrimental effects on cognitive functioning,” Wesley Moons of the University of California at Santa Barbara told Jennifer Garfinkel, in cases of moderate anger “people are motivated to think carefully about the information available to them.” Apparently it’s possible to  be a level-headed hothead.
