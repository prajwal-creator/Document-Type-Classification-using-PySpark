But other people are more attached to their art and don’t ever want the curtain to come down on their collections. They are finding other solutions. Consider what a few of the new rich are doing, taking cues from the likes of Henry Clay Frick and Norton Simon by creating their own museums, foundations and galleries. They include Alice Walton, the Wal-Mart heiress; Ronald Lauder, diplomat, businessman and philanthropist; Eli Broad, who made his fortune in real estate; Donald Rubin, who founded a health care network; Raymond D. Nasher, a real estate developer; and Emily Fisher Landau, a member of a wealthy New York real estate family. Their museums and foundations are meant to expose their art to others, and incidentally, to serve as monuments that will outlive them and be part of the future art world.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The yearly budget for Ronald Lauder’s Neue Galerie in Manhattan was $9 million in 2006 (not including the $135 million Mr. Lauder spent last year for Gustav Klimt’s “Adele Bloch-Bauer I”). In that same year, the museum brought in $5 million from admissions, donations and other sources, said Scott Gutterman, the museum’s deputy director. The Rubin Museum of Art in Manhattan, a haven for the Himalayan art collected by Donald and Shelley Rubin, had a budget of $12 million last year and received about $6 million from sources that included admissions, donations and dues. There are also lesser-known personal galleries and museums, like Emily Fisher Landau’s 25,000-square-foot museum for contemporary art in Queens, which spent about $750,000 in 2004, the last year for which public data is available. Donald Hess, a Swiss businessman who owns vineyards all over the world, has set up galleries alongside them. The vineyard gallery he has in the Napa Valley has virtually no budget; it depends on the vineyard’s success. Whatever their budgets, these museums and galleries share one trait: each was created by a single vision and a single fortune. Mr. Rubin, who built and ran MultiPlan, a business that put together medical networks  for insurers, sold it last year to the Carlyle Group for an undisclosed price. Mr. Rubin and his wife grew enchanted with Himalayan art in 1974 after a walk along Madison Avenue. They saw a scroll painting, or thangka, of a female Buddha and bought it on the spot, beginning a frantic burst of acquisition that helped the Rubins build a collection of about 2,000 pieces. The couple created a Web site, himalayanart.org , to showcase their art. Then Mr. Rubin investigated giving part of the collection to museums, but decided against it after learning that major institutions could have as much as 100 times more art than they show.

He did not have any idea what it would cost, he said, but went ahead anyway, opening it in 2004. “I flew by the seat of my pants,” he said, adding that the museum was “almost like a calling” to him. “It is something you have to do to give meaning to life,” he said.

It also includes about $1 million for publicity. A portion of the budget pays for publications, public programs and development. Mr. Rubin has created a $75 million endowment for the museum, but he is realistic about its long-term odds. “‘We have some money and we are doing great shows,” he said. “We have 5,000 members, but the bottom line is that the public has to come to the aid of museums.” The Rubin has had about 150,000 visitors a year since it opened. Mr. Rubin said he was pleased, since “a lot of consultants told us that number would go down and it has not.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Collectors do not have the upper hand in negotiating gifts. Museums do. “The power has swung to the museums,” said Susan Frunzi, a lawyer who specializes in trusts and estates at the Manhattan firm Schulte Roth & Zabel. “They have so much inventory that they can’t show it all, or they store much of it.” Creating a foundation or museum allows the collector to share the artwork — and to display it the way they want. There are also cost savings. Donating art provides tax advantages, but only if the collection is open to a segment of the public, like students, scholars or people from the art world, who can visit at specific times. “For the contributions to be deductible, the institution has to be serving the public,” Ms. Frunzi said. “Of course, some people ask if they can keep the paintings on their living room wall and get the deduction, or in a separate building on their personal property,” she said. “In the former case it is not possible, and in the latter case, it is possible if structured correctly.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Another benefit is promotional value. Mr. Hess, the Swiss businessman who created galleries at his vineyards around the world, includes paintings by Anselm Kiefer, Francis Bacon and Lucien Freud at the one in Napa Valley. Though Mr. Hess is an ambitious collector, he also recognizes that the galleries enhance a visit to the vineyard. He said that running the gallery next to the vineyard also meant that the costs were relatively low. Mr. Hess, whose Swiss corporation owns the art, said he hoped the galleries would survive him, but he was honest: “What will happen in 50 years is impossible to say,” he said. The collector Marieluise Hessel wanted her collection to help students learn about being curators. She and her former husband, Richard B. Black, created a graduate program in the field at Bard College, where Mrs. Hessel made her collection available for study. She later donated money for a building to house new exhibitions. “The school has already graduated over 100 curators,” said Leon Botstein, the president of Bard. Integrating an art center with an academic institution gives the art a broader function, Dr. Botstein said. Otherwise, “There is no larger purpose except to show how wealthy somebody was and what good taste they had,” he said. “It is simply a personal mausoleum with personal artifacts.” Mr. Broad, the entrepreneur, and his wife, Edythe, have already created the Broad Art Foundation in Santa Monica, Calif., with 4,000 visitors a year. But Mr. Broad’s larger goal is to create a museum within a museum: the Broad Contemporary Art Museum at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The museum, which is under construction, will combine the Broads’ vast collection and the Broad Art Foundation’s holdings with the museum’s own collection in a building designed by Renzo Piano. Mr. Broad contributed $50 million for the building, but will not say whether his art will ultimately belong to the museum. He said he was optimistic about personal museums. “I think these museums will survive,” he said, “if they are fiscally sound with a strong endowment.”   A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SPG11 of the National edition with the headline: Immortality, Or a Museum Of One’s Own.
