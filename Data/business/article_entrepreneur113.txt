This is not a movie. The talk is serious, even desperate, and the Terminator says he will give it serious consideration. The California Republican Party has sunk to its lowest point in more than 20 years, so beaten down and splintered by internecine feuding between its hard-right and centrist factions that it now holds only one statewide elective office (secretary of state), only 20 of 54 Congressional seats (both senators are Democrats) and only 44 of 120 state legislative seats (the Senate is almost vetoproof). Al Gore carried the state last November by a dozen points. Only a few other states, like Hawaii and Maryland, are more dominated by Democrats. But while some party members see Mr. Schwarzenegger, with his huge name recognition and deep pockets, as a political savior, others, mostly moderates fed up with hard-right dominance of the party, see a thorough overhaul of the party leadership as the quickest road to salvation. To that end, with the encouragement and support of White House political aides and other national party leaders, they have recently managed to seize control of much of the party's governing machinery, most notably its money operations.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       ''Not only do we have some fresh leadership in place,'' Mr. Brulte went on, ''but we see a great political opportunity in the electricity crisis that has hit the state. The Democrats are really botching it up. I don't know who's going be taking on Gray Davis next year when he runs for re-election -- Schwarzenegger or whoever -- but I know we've got a real shot at capturing the governor's office again.'' Like many other Republican parties around the country, the California party has been losing strength in the suburbs, once a dependable stronghold and now home to a growing number of moderate former city dwellers. The more the Republican hard-right element has talked about outlawing abortions, rolling back gun control laws and loosening environmental regulations, the more the suburban vote, particularly the ''soccer mom'' vote, has moved toward the Democrats. Similarly, the Republican Party's past support of stricter immigration laws has let California Democrats grab most of the ever-growing Latino vote. One of every three Californians is now Latino and many remain implacably anti-Republican. ''When you're in trouble with the suburban vote and the Latino vote in California, you've got political problems, big time, maybe even disaster,'' said Sherry Bibitch Jeffee, a political scientist at the University of Southern California who specializes in California politics. Trying to reverse the trend, the Bush moderates seized control of the party machinery two weeks ago when the party convened in Sacramento to elect new officers. When adjournment came, the hard right forces still held the party chairmanship but the real power -- the budgeting and fund-raising operations -- were controlled by moderates. Equally important, for the first time in years, a convention had been held in which there was minimal open ideological feuding over abortion, gun control, the environment and other old divisive issues. ''We were able to take charge because things had hit rock bottom and there was no way but up,'' Mr. Brulte recalled. ''We could say, in effect, that we represented the new president of the United States and he was in a position to help California Republicans if they would only stop self-destructing and help themselves.

But we have been talking with White House and Congressional and national party people since November, folks like Karl Rove, and they're fully behind us.'' The new party chairman is Shawn Steel, a hard-core conservative from Beverly Hills. But while Mr. Steel may hold the party gavel, the money power that ultimately makes political wheels turn now rests in the hands of two moderates, Gerald Parsky, a Los Angeles venture capitalist who ran the Bush campaign in California last year, and Thomas F. Stephenson, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and major Bush donor.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Steel acknowledged the power shift as the convention ended, saying the party had shown a willingness to make ''astonishing'' changes when needed. Then, giving a warm hug to Brooks Firestone, a moderate former state legislator from the Santa Barbara wine country who had challenged him for the chairman's job, he declared that California had a ''new'' Republican Party. ''We're moving ahead,'' Mr. Firestone added. Maybe. But the task remains all uphill. The contentious issues that have divided the party's elements for so long still smolder, the flames dampened but not extinguished by the bonhomie hugs at the Sacramento convention. ''Nobody's saying we've got it all worked out, that abortion and guns and the environment are no longer issues,'' Mr. Steel said. ''What we are saying is that we are working to work it all out.'' Many political experts say the party's organizing, registration, fund-raising and get-out-the-vote efforts have all lagged in recent years because of all the ideological feuding. Whatever the case, only 35 percent of California's voters are registered as Republicans, compared with 45 percent who are registered as Democrats, and by some counts, at least a million California Republicans did not bother to vote last November (Mr. Gore won by 1.3 million votes). In many races around the state, Republican candidates were outspent as much as three to one by their Democratic opponents.

One early glimmer of light, in Republican eyes, is the trouble Governor Davis is having as he tries to solve the electricity crisis. The longer the crisis lasts, the more there is optimistic Republican talk about ousting him in 2002. Secretary of State Bill Jones, the sole Republican holding statewide office, has been talking for months about taking him on. There is talk, too, that William E. Simon Jr., the son of the late United States Treasury secretary, might have a go at him. Neither has stirred much excitement. But Mr. Schwarzenegger, a registered Republican whose name first came up about three weeks ago, has kicked up some buzz, even though he has thus far refused to commit one way or the other. Should he be taken seriously? ''You ignore the Terminator at your own risk,'' said Dan Schnur, a former party consultant and spokesman. ''He has the name ID. He has the money. And never forget that this is California, home of that washed-up old actor and television pitchman Ronald Reagan.'' Correction: March 14, 2001, Wednesday  An article yesterday about the California Republican Party's difficulties in attracting voters misspelled the name of a political scientist from the University of Southern California who had commented. She is Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, not Bibitch. Correction: March 16, 2001, Friday  An article on Tuesday about the California Republican Party's difficulties in attracting voters misspelled the name of a political scientist from the University of Southern California who commented. And a correction on Wednesday cited the error incompletely. The political scientist is Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, not Bibitch Jeffee.
