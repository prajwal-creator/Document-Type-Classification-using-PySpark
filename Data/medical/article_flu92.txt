''There will be a day of baseball tomorrow and a day of baseball the next day until we get it right,'' Steinbrenner said today after the Yankees had managed only four hits and committed three errors that led to four runs by a split-squad Oriole team that included only four frontline players. ''When guys make five and six hundred thousand dollars a year, there's no such thing as battle fatigue,'' Steinbrenner said.  But in the clubhouse here, the players appeared increasingly weary as the Yankees' extended training camp, which began on Feb. 9, continues without the days off Steinbrenner anticipated when he ''invited'' his team to come south early. A half-dozen players have the flu, at least that many are injured and the rest have been making bus trips between here and Pompano Beach and West Palm Beach for A and B games in the same day. Who's on First? Because of illness and injury, and to test certain players at new positions, the lineup has been scrambled virtually every game.  Several players have no idea what position they will be playing on any given day and several others say they feel sure they will be traded.

Although official statistics are kept only for A games, in which the Yankee record is 3-10, with seven losses in the last eight games, over all the Yankees have won seven of 19 and scored more than five runs only four times.

''I get out of the whirlpool and half of me is still there,'' said Dave Revering, who is alternating between first and third base.  ''Some guys we're not able to rest because other guys are sick,'' Lemon said after today's game. ''They've been down here long enough that I thought they were in good shape. Maybe it's too long. Maybe I misjudged what their condition was. We sure played like we're tired and it wasn't from getting on base.'' Less than two weeks ago, Steinbrenner said that he had had ''to learn the hard way'' that spring results ''don't mean anything in October,'' but that he would he expect more of the team as the season approached. A Swipe at Manager Today, after watching from his box as the Yankees, their heads bowed, headed out to the back field to run their postgame laps, the owner scattered blame for the team's poor showing. He acknowledged that the Yankees seem to be sleep-walking through games, but said ''it's the manager's job to get them fired up.''

But he added that he had designed the current team with the advice of his front-office executives, top scouts and on-the-field staff. ''I gave them eight or nine opportunities to tell me this wasn't the way to go,'' Steinbrenner said. ''They told me we were constituted good enough to win it. If we're not, nine guys were wrong, and I don't like getting bad advice.'' Steinbrenner also had some harsh words for Dave Winfield, who has missed the last two games with a hamstring pull, and Graig Nettles, who left today's game with a bruised right calf. ''All my starters are on the bench,'' the owner said, insisting that he cannot make trade decisions when he hasn't seen his regular team play.  ''Everytime I turn around they've got this or that. Winfield and Nettles can't seem to put two games together.'' Nettles, the captain, had nothing to say as he hobbled through the empty Yankee clubhouse late this afternoon with bandages on his right leg and on both elbows. But Winfield, who is hitting .156 this spring, seemed uncommonly unsettled. ''You've never seen me mad, have you?'' he asked. ''Well you never know when it's going to happen.'' Soft Words From Foote   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   However, Barry Foote, the veteran catcher, was willing, for the time being, to trust in Steinbrenner's approach. ''The man pays the bill, so he has the right to do it his way,'' Foote said. ''He's done a lot of unorthodox things that have turned out good and it's hard to fault him for wanting us to win. Sometimes he goes about things in a different way than other people. It's not necessarily wrong and it's not necessarily right. We'll have to see what happens.'' ''I used to think that playing for the Yankees was no more pressure than playing for anyone else, but I was wrong, and this spring has proved it,'' said Rudy May, the 37-year-old left-hander who has pitched more innings than any Yankee pitcher this spring and has not given up an earned run in 13 innings. May, however, did make one of the Yankee errors today, leading to a run; the other two were made at third base by Tucker Ashford, about whom Steinbrenner said today ''took himself out of the picture.''
