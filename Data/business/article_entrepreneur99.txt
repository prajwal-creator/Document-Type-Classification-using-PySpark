This 70-foot yawl, called the Petrel, sailed into the city in 1972 and made her summer home by a floating dock just west of the Staten Island Ferry Terminal in Manhattan. Her skipper, a burly welder named Nick van Nes, spent the next 28 years sailing people around the harbor, a pioneer in the local charter business. It was into this scene that Thomas Berton, the son of East Village bohemians, skated on his Rollerblades one summer 15 years ago. Mr. van Nes was lugging a mainsail from his red pickup truck onto the Petrel, and Mr. Berton and a friend offered to help. As thanks, the skipper took them sailing. Within a week, Mr. Berton, then 24, was sleeping on the boat overnight as a volunteer member of the crew. "Typically, people were either turned off or they jumped to it," Mr. van Nes said recently. "Tom jumped. But then, we weren't just a sailboat. We had a following, a little world."

Many, like Mr. Berton, knew nothing about sailing when they stumbled on the boat. Most were content to sail city waters, rarely venturing beyond. But more than a few grew up to helm and crew the Petrel, sometimes for pay but usually for the sport of it. Spending time on the boat became an urban ritual for these few dozen office workers, writers, brokers and social workers. So, all of them panicked when Mr. van Nes and the Petrel retired to Martha's Vineyard four years ago.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       But this is a love story about two ships, not one. These city sailors have found a rescuer in one of their own, Mr. Berton, now 39. After prospering as a real estate and retail entrepreneur, he now owns a sailboat for hire. From early April through October, he takes people on sails costing $45 to $65 up to five times a day on his 82-foot, double-masted schooner, berthed at the North Cove Marina in Battery Park City. His sailboat is called the Shearwater, named for a seabird related to -- what else? -- the petrel. Mr. Berton said Mr. van Nes opened his and others' nautical eyes. "Me, I was born and raised in New York," he said, "so I could always answer the question of whether Manhattan was A) an island or B) an isthmus. But until we met Nick and the Petrel, we had no idea what it really meant to live on an island and love the water around it." Just after sunset on a recent balmy Thursday, the Shearwater wriggled out of North Cove and into the Hudson. This maneuver requires the artless precision of a valet in a packed parking garage. At least 20 vessels of varying size and opulence sway in the marina. Of these, the Shearwater is almost certainly the oldest, built in 1929 as a gentleman's toy and operated mostly by hand and wind. But Matt Beck, one of its three alternating captains, steered with a quiet assurance. Out in the water, Ellis Island glowed like a jack-o'-lantern. Canada geese skimmed over the waves, their silhouettes black in the mauve dusk. A dozen passengers watched from the teak decks. A few explored the mahogany staterooms below deck. A cluster, however, had gathered around Mr. Beck at the stern. These are the Petrel people, the regulars who knew Mr. Beck in the late 1980's when he was a still a screenwriter fresh from Rochester.

(Some years, she took the Staten Island Ferry to and from her day job, only to run around the corner and board the Petrel for evening sails.) The crew gently teased her for two years until her hands were sufficiently calloused from rope burns to let her forgo gloves. Regulars still love to hear about how Mr. van Nes's parents taught their six children to sail on the family boat at City Island. They heard how his father bought the 1937 Petrel for $26,000 in a Coast Guard auction in early 1964. The boat had been a weekend plaything of President Kennedy's. They heard how her early crews in Battery Park were Mr. van Nes's welder friends from the Brooklyn Navy Yard. They heard about the 17-year old who went into labor during a sail in 1979, and gave her baby the same initials as Mr. van Nes's company, Bring Sailing Back. Over the years, these stories no longer belonged to one sailor. They blended into the group's shared mythology. But more and more, Mr. van Nes let his captains oversee his boat while he stayed home, and even berthed the Petrel at Martha's Vineyard for the winter. He wearied of fighting, both for city permits and against competition. (At least three charter sailboats work from Lower Manhattan now.) Mr. Beck, tacking back toward the marina, said: "I got my captain's license in 2000, and I called Nick to see when he was bringing the Petrel back. He said, 'I'm not,' and my heart just sank. Then he told me some guys were putting together another boat and I couldn't believe it. The Shearwater was my saving grace."

For a while, Petrel regulars were his only passengers. A boyish but pensive host, he is more soft-spoken than Mr. van Nes. He has fewer tales of oceangoing seamanship and no salt-and-pepper beard. He feels more than anything like the resident adviser to this fraternity of Petrel fans. But they love him for that, too. Richard Balestrino, the executive editor for American Media Mini Mag Group, can once again take his favorite place along the bowsprit, which he calls the vessel's "Titanic" spot. His dog, Peaches, prefers the cockpit. Chris (Iron Man) van Nes, Mr. van Nes's nephew, can now play first mate to the Shearwater, having quit his job at an art-casting foundry upstate. Michael Fisher, the Northeast sales director for Texas Monthly magazine, can sit on deck at least twice a month and wish for wind. "The more wind," Mr. Fisher said, "the faster I'm there." Now, it is Nick van Nes who turns wistful when friends call him with stories about the city. Most are about the Shearwater. And the new volunteers? Most are city kids like Noam Primak, 24, an economics major at Hunter College. Mr. Primak knows little about sailing and nothing about the Petrel. But he is smitten with the Shearwater. "I haven't brought any friends out yet," he said, grinning on her deck in the twilight. "I'm keeping this to myself for a while."
