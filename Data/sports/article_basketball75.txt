This one starts with flaming red hair, a dull black-and-white photograph and one man’s ravenous curiosity about a team few others even knew. Last Friday night in Springfield, Mass., about 65 women (many with fiery auburn hair) were inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame , and the All American Red Heads officially emerged from basketball obscurity. The Red Heads were one of the nation’s first professional women’s teams, barnstorming small towns across the United States starting in 1936 — 36 years before Title IX, 60 years before the W.N.B.A. and 16 years after women won the right to vote. They played exclusively against men, using the men’s rules, and routinely beat them. They sometimes played 200 games in a year.

They were pioneers, role models and progenitors of the women’s game and, until Friday night, largely forgotten.

The 65 women who took the stage in Springfield — representing many more who once wore the Red Heads uniform — have not yet caught the attention of Hollywood, although they did have a tireless champion in their midst. “They’re my idols,” said John Molina, the Red Heads’ unofficial historian, who joined the team in Springfield and arguably put them there. Years ago, Molina discovered a black-and-white photograph in his grandmother’s attic in Glastonbury, Conn. It featured his grandmother, Bernice Gondek Molina, and several other women, the 1934 women’s basketball team for the J. B. Williams soap factory. Molina was fascinated. His grandmother died before he got the chance to ask her about the team. But the photo sparked his curiosity and sent him on an obsessive fact-finding journey spanning 15 years and many generations of forgotten pioneers. “I always wondered how we got from there to today,” Molina said. He scoured the Internet for facts and photographs, anything that could further the story of women’s basketball in the early 20th century. “I came across a picture on eBay of this woman palming a basketball,” Molina said with awe, describing a Depression-era photo. “It was like, ‘Wait a minute, this is not what women are supposed to be doing.’ You’re talking tumbleweeds and the Depression, and you have women going out and playing by the men’s rules and beating them. It was just, like, wow. This is Americana at its best.” In 2000, Molina met with the Red Heads’ second owner, Orwell Moore, and the two began speaking three times a week. In 2006, Molina nominated the Red Heads for the Hall of Fame for the first time, and he had pushed for their entry ever since. They were finalists in 2010.

About two dozen women had been inducted into the Hall of Fame before Friday. The Red Heads, who played until 1986, paved the way for them all, by the example they set and by the imaginations they sparked. In early photographs of their games, the stands were filled primarily with men.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Their opponents were local men’s teams, who played not only to win but to avoid embarrassment in front of their neighbors. “They didn’t want to lose,” Molina said. “The Red Heads would leave the next day; the men were still in town, having to answer questions.” The Red Heads once won 96 games in 96 days, with three days off and three doubleheaders. In 1940, they became the first professional basketball team to play in the Philippines, before a crowd of 10,000. They dutifully entertained crowds, even in the face of tragedy — after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. One Red Head appeared on “The Mike Douglas Show” and taught Betty White how to spin a basketball. Another scored 105 points in two games. “You know what: they could play hoop,” Molina said admiringly. The Red Heads were founded in Cassville, Mo., by C. M. Olson, known as Ole, who coined the nickname as a nod to his wife’s salon business. Some players were natural redheads; the rest had their hair dyed, a practice that carried through several generations of Red Heads.

Moore’s wife, Lorene, played nine seasons for the Red Heads, scoring more than 35,000 points. Their daughter, Tammy Harrison, gave the acceptance speech Friday, surrounded by 65 Red Heads. The club disbanded in 1986, having perhaps outlived its usefulness. “Title IX in some ways was almost a nail in the barnstorming coffin, because now there was equal time on courts for girls,” Molina said. “There were a lot of opportunities for women to go to college.” Molina has been dutifully collecting anecdotes, photos, contracts and letters for 15 years and estimates that he has 20,000 artifacts. His two Web sites, allamericanredheads.com and womensbasketballmuseum.com , contain some of the highlights. A book, written with Matt Zeysing, a historian at the Hall of Fame, is on the way. If all goes well, perhaps a movie will follow — a film of their own. It all began with a single snapshot, hanging in a dusty Connecticut attic. “I lost a chance to learn her stories,” Molina said of his grandmother, “but by doing what I started doing, I could promote other stories, other grandmothers’ and mothers’ stories, and getting families talking about it.”   A version of this article appears in print on September 9, 2012, on Page SP5 of the New York edition with the headline: Photo in an Attic Leads to a Forgotten Team’s Place in the Hall of Fame.
