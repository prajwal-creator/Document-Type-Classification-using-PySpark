A study shows that two out of five people who start a diet for the New Year break it in the first week . With all the attention on diets, past and present , we looked at what our ancestors ate.  Photo        Two out of five people who start a diet for the New Year break it in the first week.   Credit Malin Fezehai for The New York Times    About 100 million years ago, tree-dwelling apes believed to be our ancestors were for the most part vegetarians, scientists say, eating berries, seeds, nuts, grasses and fruits — as well as insects and the occasional small creature. It wasn’t until roughly three million years ago that our more recent ancestors are thought to have started eating meat regularly. Various theories account for the growth in brain size in the first Homo species, about two million years ago. Some scholars say it was a meat-rich diet that led the first Homo species to make tools. Those tools helped draw out extra nutrients from cooking animals and plants, and led to biological and evolutionary changes that made us who we are today. The beverage of choice was water from lakes, ponds or streams. Fermentation was discovered only about 10,000 years ago, so alcohol came relatively recently. Even more recent was the habit of drinking cow milk, an innovation of Northern Europeans. Now, back to those resolutions. Here’s how to make them stick , plus some simple rules for healthy eating and how to make yourself go to the gym . Victoria Shannon contributed reporting.
