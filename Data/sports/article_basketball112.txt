The Lakers’ roster is loaded with stars; the Hollywood elite fills their seats. Used to be, a little red, blue and white was smattered around town. Not anymore. The Clippers have charged through the door, with a quiet, freckled redhead from Oklahoma leading the way. Blake Griffin has done what was thought could not be done: he has made the Clippers relevant. The whirlwind relationship has taken the city by storm, fans captivated by Griffin’s aerial acrobatics and devil-may-care approach to the game, though those fans shriek in horror when one of Griffin’s leaps ends with an awkward fall.

Everybody is cynical; obviously, Clipper fans are cynical. You almost expect something bad to happen, because he really is almost too good to be true.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       After a spectacular two-year career with the Oklahoma Sooners, Griffin missed all of his first season with a broken kneecap that did not heal properly. But this season Griffin, 21, has captured the imagination of basketball fans with an astounding highlight reel that grows by the night, barely showing the effects of his multiple knee operations. On Jan. 22 at Staples Center , Griffin had a 30-point, 18-rebound, 8-assist performance against the Golden State Warriors, the third time the two teams had played in two weeks. The Clippers won the game, the rubber match, but it came at a price. Guard Eric Gordon, who ranks eighth in the N.B.A. at 24.1 points per game, chipped a bone in his wrist after a fall and will miss a month. It is a crucial loss, one that weighs on Griffin, who must now carry the team. Griffin has averaged 25.7 points and 13.9 rebounds for the Clippers in January, his 22.6 season average ranking 13th in the N.B.A. He appears motivated by an almost singular quest, not out to just win, but to change the culture of a long-dormant franchise, one that has had only fleeting moments of joy in years. “That’s where it starts,” Griffin said. “You can’t build anything long term until you change the foundation. The foundation is important for us, and we need to do a good job every single day. It’s not just the starters, the guys who play a lot of minutes. It’s everybody. I can’t stress that enough.” Griffin deflects the attention, but local fans are clearly enamored. Paul Hertzberg has been a Clippers season-ticket holder for years, and he is president and chief executive of CineTel Films , a production company that has found success with horror movies. These two facts are not contradictory.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Hertzberg said he had been tempted to sell his tickets only twice this season. He would not give the price, but he said they sold for 10 times as much as last season.

Smith/European Pressphoto Agency    “The energy for these kids is just amazing,” Hertzberg said. “They run, they shoot. Eric Gordon has just grown this year. But Blake makes it special. You come to a game because you never know what you’re going to see.” Griffin is not a shy young man  he jokes and laughs with teammates, team officials and reporters. But he is reserved in his self-judgment. “I don’t read the newspapers,” Griffin said after the win over the Warriors. “I watch ‘SportsCenter,’ it’s my favorite show. But I don’t pay attention to it.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

A lot of teams have won 17 games.” Entering Saturday’s game against Charlotte, the Clippers (17-28) had won 12 of their last 19 games, but still had the third-worst record in the Western Conference, doomed by a 5-21 start. The Lakers, of course, are near the top of the conference again, at 33-14. They have met twice this season; the first time, on Dec. 8, the Lakers won, 87-86 . It was the second game, on Jan. 16, that tilted the attention toward the Clippers, the game that gave long-suffering fans the biggest glimmer of hope. The Clippers won, 99-92 , with Griffin adding 18 points and 15 rebounds. More importantly, the Clippers fought back. Griffin and Baron Davis scuffled with Lamar Odom late in the game, the threesome getting ejected along with Lakers forward Ron Artest. These Clippers will not be pushed around. “It’s so, so beautiful, it’s amazing,” said Darrell Bailey, more affectionately known as Clipper Darrell, the team’s unofficial biggest fan, during the Golden State game. “It feels like the playoffs right now.” He added that Griffin had brought back the fans, had “brought the energy back in this building.” As he said this, Clipper Darrell leaned forward in his seat, in the corner halfway up the first section. He was off his feet for perhaps the first time in an hour, leading a chorus of cheers. He suddenly stopped. Griffin had crashed to the floor after getting fouled, stumbled and caromed into the announcer’s table. He was dazed and so was the Staples Center crowd, letting out an eerie gasp. To Clippers fans, another Griffin injury might be the nail in the coffin for the season.

M.V.P.!” “For the past three years, I only bought one season ticket,” said Clipper Darrell, whose streak of 386 consecutive home games was broken by illness last season. “It was so hard to find people to go. Now everyone is calling me for tickets. Everybody wants to see Blake. I’m driving down the street  you know, I have that Clipper car”  a BMW painted in glossy red, white and blue with multiple Clippers logos  “and people used to throw their middle finger at me, throw the L at me. Now people pound their fist, say: ‘Blake Griffin, baby. Blake Griffin.’ ” The Clippers cannot hide from their past, and no people are more aware of their place in Los Angeles than the Clippers. “We do at times feel like the stepchild,” said center DeAndre Jordan, Griffin’s locker-room neighbor and best friend on the team. “But at the same time, those guys have been highly successful. They have banners in their arena.” The Lakers’ arena is also the Clippers’ arena. In two words, Jordan tells the whole story: their arena, not our arena. It is still the Lakers’ town, but now that Griffin has arrived, the Clippers are feeling more at home.
