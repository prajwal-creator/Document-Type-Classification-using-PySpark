A few pilgrims brave the chill to visit this monument to man's ingenuity.  They bundle up in woolen scarves and overcoats, then hurry home to a warm fire and a hot toddy to keep from catching cold. A few miles south of Stonehenge, pelted by the same winds, stands another curiously English monument to patience - a colony of decrepit prefabricated huts and World War II frame barracks that looks like a movie set for ''The Great Escape.'' Here, another band of pilgrims is gathered. But rather than trying to avoid colds, these people are trying to catch them. For this circle of worn gray buildings is England's Harvard Hospital, where, since 1946, more than 18,000 visitors have made their way to try, at Government expense, to get sick. Harvard is one of the most important centers in the world for the study of the common cold. But it is also a quaint cross between a sophisticated virology laboratory and a British holiday camp.  Somehow, for the past 36 years, the staff at Harvard has made visitors enjoy being dosed with the germs of this most ancient human ailment. The hospital's ground rules exquisitely reflect Harvard's approach to its chosen disease. For example, at a typical orientation lunch recently, the hospital matron, Margaret Andrews, explained to a fresh batch of volunteers that if they wanted to explore the facility's 16 acres of chalk grasslands, Wellington boots would be provided. She further advised, though, that anyone wishing to venture deeper into the countryside should keep a distance of 30 feet between himself and strangers. ''The only problem would be,'' she said, ''if you met a friendly stranger who wanted directions - in which case you just fall back, cover your face with a handkerchief and say, 'Unclean! Unclean!' ''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   For all Harvard's eccentricities, however, its work is serious and promising. Last summer, the Harvard team, led by Dr. David A.J.  Tyrrell, the hospital's administrator and an authority on the cold, published results of an experiment showing that interferon, produced through recombinant DNA technology, prevented colds in a large percentage of subjects who were regularly sprayed with it.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The results set off a flurry of interest all over the world as cold researchers began trying to duplicate the interferon results. Drs.  Jack M. Gwaltney Jr. and Frederick G. Hayden of the University of Virginia Medical Center recently succeeded. ''We were really impressed that this had an important effect in preventing colds,'' Dr. Gwaltney said. ''It's the first thing tested that may have practical value.'' Interferon has yet to show it can cure a cold -though some at Harvard believe it has the potential - and years of testing will be necessary before it is ready for sale in drugstores or by doctors' prescription. But if the preliminary results hold up, they will represent the fruit of decades of work at Harvard during which progress could charitably have been characterized as slow. In its first 35 years, in fact, Harvard produced much information about cold viruses, but the research has not led to production of a single usable medicine. Nevertheless, Harvard's contribution to virology seems secure. It is unique in its concentration on the common cold and in the large number of volunteer subjects it tests every year. ''That organization has really served as a model for all of us,'' says Dr. Elliot C.  Dick, a University of Wisconsin Medical School researcher. ''Long before we even knew what viruses were involved, they were doing transmission studies that were very useful.'' And Dr. Robert B. Couch, a Baylor College of Medicine virologist who studies respiratory infections for the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, calls Harvard, ''The number one pioneering unit in common-cold research.'' That Harvard Hospital is still standing today is testimony to its staff's tenacity and curiosity. The hospital was originally built as a stopgap to deal with an epidemic that did not break out. With World War II threatening, English public-health specialists theorized that large-scale bombing of cities would spark epidemics of cholera and typhoid, as sanitary facilities broke down. When England declared war on Germany, a group at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., decided to help the British combat the anticipated plagues. Harvard donated the funds to build and staff a special hospital devoted to epidemiology, and the facility was hastily built on the hills above Salisbury to be ready when the outbreaks hit. The plagues never came, and in 1942, the United States Army absorbed the Harvard facility and renamed it the First United States Army Medical Laboratory. Its most important task was the assembling, storing and typing of the enormous supplies of blood needed for the D-Day invasion of Normandy in June 1944. When Germany surrendered, the Americans departed, leaving behind the buildings, some laboratory equipment and a large upholstered sofa, which still adorns the staff dining room. The medical ghost town attracted the covetous gaze of Dr.  Christopher Andrewes, an English virologist who was trying to persuade the British Medical Research Council (the equivalent of the United States National Institutes of Health) to fund a long-range study of the cold and related respiratory diseases like influenza.  In 1946, Dr. Andrewes took over the hospital and changed its name back to Harvard Hospital, a tribute to the original builders. (Its full name now is the Medical Research Council's Common Cold Unit at Harvard Hospital.)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Dr. Andrewes, who was knighted for his work at Harvard when he retired in 1961, began the hospital's tradition of recruiting human volunteers. At his opening press conference, he made headlines by suggesting that honeymooners might take advantage of the facilities by becoming experimental subjects. Thereafter, whenever the stream of applicants thinned out, Dr. Andrewes would make a round of appearances on radio and, later, on television; not only did the volunteers keep coming, but the research center became a minor part of British postwar folklore, immortalized in music-hall songs and cartoons.  Harvard today continues the sophisticated public-relations program that keeps volunteers coming, 30 at a time, for a 10-day stay. When applications decline, Harvard scientists call in the press for a progress report. Soon, unemployed workers, students writing theses, civil servants using up excess leave, housewives and thrill seekers are writing to make reservations. The main attraction is the cost - nothing. Harvard pays travel expenses and even provides $2.80 a day for pocket money. After a medical checkup designed, among other things, to eliminate those who might have arrived with colds picked up elsewhere (''wild colds''), the subjects are assigned to sparsely furnished rooms in one of the converted barracks. Each unit of two or three rooms shares a living room and a kitchen with refrigerator, teapot and toaster.  The old buildings present a fire hazard and cooking is forbidden, so meals are delivered to patients' doors in thermos containers. Following a group lunch and pep talk by the medical staff, the volunteers enter isolation. This consists of staying at least 30 feet from everyone except the other members of their group; staff members who enter the rooms wear gowns and masks. But the volunteers can watch television, listen to a radio-cassette player, work jigsaw puzzles, play Monopoly or Scrabble, read books from the library, make telephone calls or use the miniature-golf course, paddle-tennis court or pool table. On the third day of isolation, the volunteers face the ''virus challenge.'' Gowned scientists drip a colorless, salty fluid into their nostrils. This may be a harmless saline solution, or it may contain a live cold virus. The experiments are double blind and neither the doctors nor the subjects know which it is. But the routine is basically the same, whether the volunteers are testing a possible cold preventative or cure that a drug company has commissioned the hospital to test, lending their noses for a ''harvest'' of fresh cold virus or being observed for other kinds of reactions. Every morning, a staff physician visits the volunteers. He looks down their throats, feels the glands in their necks and measures their breathing with a custom-developed ''nasal air-flow meter.'' Later, Mrs. Andrews collects the day's used tissues, sealed in plastic bags, which will be weighed to determine the subjects' ''nasal secretion rate'' - that is, how badly their noses are running. At regular intervals, volunteers are given a ''nasal wash.'' They sniff up sterile salt solution, hold it in their noses and then drip it onto a glass plate. Patients who are found to be ''shedding virus'' are considered to have been infected. Even those who do get colds seem to manage to enjoy their stay there and to carry on a strange, remote kind of social life.  ''I started feeling ill on Friday afternoon,'' recalled Veronica Brogden, a 19-year-old from Portsmouth, who signed up to fill time before starting nurse's training. ''My glands were up. I had a sore throat by 8 in the evening and I was really dry - I was drinking gallons and gallons. I woke up Saturday morning with a stuffy nose, and by 11 I had a backache and I was shivering slightly.'' Most of that day, Veronica ran a slight fever as well - but by the next day she felt good as new. ''Saturday I was practically dying off; on Sunday I felt fine. Sunday I had a hyperactive day.'' Because Veronica's group was part of a ''virus harvest,'' she was not given any drugs and her cold simply played itself out. When Veronica felt her worst, she watched television. For the rest of the time, she said, she and her roommate carried on ''a sort of correspondence with some of our neighbors. We wrote them letters and left them at their door and then ran away. They sent us gifts and we sent them horrible things in return.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Their three male neighbors had spotted Veronica and her 18-yearold roommate, Rachel Lee, at the opening lunch; they began negotiations by sending over a plant packed in a pickle container from the lunch tray. Long-distance acquaintanceship progressed from there. Indeed, the Harvard staff proudly recalls a few romances that have ripened into marriage. ''The important thing is to keep the volunteers happy while they're here,'' says Keith Thompson, the former executive officer. And most volunteers seem to go off satisfied; many buy souvenir sweatshirts identifying them as common-cold volunteers. There have been no fatalities and almost no cases of severe illness in the 36-year history of Harvard. Even with all the amenities, of course, the prospect of picking up a cold is not everyone's idea of a holiday. Most volunteers, however, seem relatively unruffled about the risk of a sniffle. Perhaps that is because - to the volunteers' delight and the staff's frustration - it is extremely hard, even under these conditions, to infect another person with a cold. ''Believe it or not, one of our biggest problems is giving people colds,'' says Dr. Robert Philpotts, a staff virologist. ''If I could give 80 percent of the people colds, we could finish this work very quickly. The actual figure is between one in three and one in five.'' When Dr. Christopher Andrewes and his team went to work on the cold in 1946, even less information was available about how people caught colds. It was customary to speak of ''the cold virus''; once this entity had been isolated, it was assumed, a vaccine would be developed. In his search of the virus, Dr. Andrewes had volunteers with colds blow their noses into cellophane handkerchiefs or recite Shakespeare with their heads inside bags, which would then be harvested for germs. To try to produce colds, he sent volunteers off for long walks on cold days, turned off the heat in their flats and made them sit around in wet socks. ''We couldn't satisfy ourselves that chilling by itself did anything,'' Dr. Andrewes recalled recently. (In fact, Harvard researchers say, the feeling many of us have that we have gotten chilled and then caught cold is probably backward - we felt chilled because we had a cold coming on.) One famous experiment was designed to see how long it would take for colds to be transmitted to a group of volunteers who had been isolated all summer on an island in the Hebrides. Since no one came or went for weeks, it was assumed there would be no colds among the group by the end of the summer. Then Dr. Andrewes beached a wave of boats carrying infected volunteers.

Not one sniffle developed. In panic, the team recruited a garrulous crofter from a nearby island with a well-developed wild cold. After a few hours of listening to him spin yarns around the fire, three out of eight finally got sick. In the lab, meanwhile, Dr. Andrewes and his team were trying to find a way to grow and study viruses outside of the nose. Reports from all over the world suggested that domestic and wild animals developed colds; Dr. Andrewes tried to infect capuchin monkeys, cotton rats, hamsters, voles, gray squirrels, flying squirrels, hedgehogs, baboons, cats, pigs and the sooty mangabey. Finally, they succeeded with chimpanzees - the only animal now known to harbor human cold viruses. But for experimental purposes, chimps were more troublesome and expensive than human volunteers.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Eventually, in the mid-1950's, American scientists isolated the first cold virus. Dr. Tyrrell, who became administrator of Harvard Hospital in 1961, then improved the laboratory method of growing these ''rhinoviruses'' (or ''nose viruses'') outside the body. The 60's were boom years of cold research. But visions of a cold vaccine began to fade when researchers found two, then a dozen and finally more than 100 rhinoviruses. In 1965, a researcher in Chicago isolated a second cold-virus family, the coronaviruses. Together, these two families of virus could account for between 55 and 70 percent of all colds. Some of the rest can be caused by influenza viruses or other viruses also capable of giving more severe infections. ''Two-thirds of colds we can now explain,'' says Dr. Tyrrell.  ''What the explanation of the other third is I wouldn't want to say.'' Cold viruses seem to find the temperature of the nose -about 33oC.  or 91.4oF. - more agreeable than the warmer climate of the blood and internal organs. The viruses attack the cells of the mucous membrane, producing congestion, sneezing and nasal drip. Some viruses have other effects, including aches, fever, coughing and chills.  Colds take two to three days to incubate and last a week or so, declining slowly from an early peak. Sufferers are most infectious at the beginning, when sneezing and dripping are at their height. The virus kills the nasal cells it infects, and it takes time to regenerate them - that's why it may take a while to ''bounce back'' from a cold. For most adults, a cold is merely a nuisance. Sometimes it requires a day or two of bed rest, but more often it simply turns the victim into a dripping, sneezing but ambulatory wreck. Children, however, often run a fever - and one adult cold virus, known as respiratory syncytial virus, can cause severe illness and even death in infants.  Colds can also threaten adults suffering from chronic asthma and bronchitis. The economic effect of colds is not negligible. The National Center for Health Statistics estimates that Americans caught 93 million colds - a rate of about 41.4 per 100 - in 1981. But this total includes only cases that led to a visit to a doctor or ''restricted activity.'' In all, these colds caused 254 million days of restricted activity, 105 million days of ''bed disability'' and 32 million days off work. In 1979 (the most recent year for which figures are available), there were 11 deaths in which ''acute naso-pharyngitis'' was listed as the sole cause of death. Most viruses give immunity afterward - but only to that one virus.  That is why small children seem to go from one cold to another, year round - their immunities are not in place. Adults tend to catch fewer colds year by year, as acquired immunities build up. Infuriating as it seems, after the decades of research into the complex of conditions called the common cold, there are still no useful suggestions for the ordinary sufferer. Once the cold has set in, the only treatment is to relieve symptoms, says Dr. John Wallace, Harvard's former clinical administrator. Like all viruses, the ones that cause colds consist of a bit of genetic material -RNA or DNA, the two acids that constitute the genetic code - wrapped in a coat of protein. When the virus attacks the cell, the genetic chemicals enter the cell, shedding the coat.  There they ''hijack'' the cell's genetic core, diverting it from its real function in the body and ordering it to build more viruses, which then leave the cell and repeat the cycle.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A cure for a cold presumably would have to invade the cell as well, destroying the virus without harming the cell. ''This type of agent is very difficult to grow,'' explains Dr. Dick, ''and for the common cold, one must have something that's nontoxic,'' something that has almost no side effects, he says. Rather than looking for cures, most research in recent years has concentrated on prophylaxis - measures that can prevent infection before it starts. Dr. Dick, for example, is the inventor of ''killer Kleenex'' - tissues impregnated with iodine that were used to prevent transmission of colds at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. During a six-week period of the polar winter, American personnel at the base are isolated from the outside world. For the experiment, Dr. Dick asked them to blow their noses once an hour with tissues, whether they were sick or not. The iodine killed viruses - and the tissues apparently reduced the usual number of colds. Now Dr. Dick is trying to devise a tissue that might be used in high-infection areas like primary schools and hospitals. But at Harvard, the current focus is on interferon as a potential cold-stopper. Most attention has been paid to interferon's promise as a treatment for some types of cancer. Tests are under way in the United States on its effect on patients suffering from breast cancer and certain kinds of lymphatic cancer, among others. But many who have worked with the mysterious, phenomenally active cellular protein believe that it may be more effective against viral diseases like the cold. In the quarter-century since interferon was discovered by researchers in Britain, scientists have still not fully explained what makes it so devastatingly effective against viruses (the initial results were so startling that many virologists refused to believe them, derisively dubbing the new protein ''imaginon''). They theorize that a tiny bit of interferon locks on to a special receptor on the surface of a cell; from this outside site, it orders the cell to construct a new cellular messenger - RNA - and the new RNA in turn constructs inside the cell a yet-undiscovered protein that actually combats the virus. A cell treated with interferon becomes inhospitable to the invading virus, which may be blocked from reproducing at all or may only produce harmless noninfectious offspring. But until recently, interferon could only be made from human blood, which made it rare and expensive. Genetic engineering, however, seems likely to make interferon available for experimentation - and eventually for treatments - at a more reasonable cost. Using gene-splicing techniques, ordinary bacteria can be ''recombined'' with bits of DNA which will instruct them to produce pure interferon. This recombinant DNA technique (and a purification technique that uses altered cells to produce ''monoclonal antibodies'') seems likely to be able to deliver large amounts of the drug at a reasonable cost. Last year, the laboratory began to test genetically engineered interferon produced in the United States. ''There is no doubt that it really does work,'' says Dr. Tyrrell. ''The probability is now infinitesimal that interferon does not prevent colds when given prophylactically.'' This means that the drug must be used regularly by a healthy patient to prevent infection before it has a chance to develop. Several years of field trials will be necessary to confirm the findings -and even if they are successful, use of interferon as a preventive would probably be limited to high-risk patients such as the elderly or those with asthma or heart disease. A doctor's prescription will likely be necessary, because of the possibility of adverse reactions. Even synthetic interferon will probably remain too expensive for daily use and it seems unlikely that healthy people would be willing to go through the winter spraying it up their noses several times a day.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But studies are planned to see if interferon could be an actual cure. Interferon may also be tested against influenza, as a potential replacement for present flu vaccines. ''Even if interferon works, there is another 10 to 15 years of work to be done - what sort of interferon, what it does, what sort of virus it acts against,'' Dr. Tyrrell says. ''If antiviral treatment of colds does come, a great deal of clinical work will be needed to get it applied in practice. We would also like to be able to expand it to more serious conditions -like the diseases of the lower respiratory tract that children get. These studies don't represent a breakthrough, but they are terribly important from the practical point of view.'' And beyond the question of drug treatments, there are other riddles to be solved. Not all the agents that cause colds have been discovered. There is still some question about exactly what a cold virus does inside the cell. And - most controversial of all - scientists are still not sure how colds spread. Dr. Gwaltney of Virginia is probably the leading researcher in the United States on this question, and he has compiled evidence suggesting that the hand may be a major culprit. (Mouth-to-mouth contact is apparently not an important cause of infection; Dr. Elliot Dick commissioned volunteers to kiss for a full 90 seconds in a series of vain attempts to establish a romantic route of transmission.) Dr. Gwaltney was originally a believer in the aerosol-droplet theory, which holds that cold viruses travel into the air through sneezing and then infest new noses. ''But everything we keep finding keeps pointing away from that.'' Harvard's Dr. Tyrrell is a droplet diehard. ''There has been a fair degree of scientific disagreement in recent years about what actually happens,'' Dr. Tyrrell says. ''Our preference is for airborne droplets.'' It may be years before the question of how colds are spread is resolved. And 10 or 15 years of research are needed to determine the effectiveness of interferon. But, at a cost of about $570,000 a year, Harvard is not particularly expensive to run, and the British Government seems to be committed to the hospital's future - both for the study of the cold and beyond. The British Medical Research Council believes Harvard's work with the cold could lead to the development of weapons against more serious viral diseases. ''The common cold, which is one of the most banal diseases, has been used as a model for all viral diseases,'' explains Dr. Christopher Booth, director of the council's Clinical Research Center. The year-in, year-out testing of volunteers at Harvard has perfected a system of measuring the effect of drugs designed to stop viral infections. ''It is, in fact, the study of substances that can stop viruses replicating.'' ''The hospital is not solely related to the common cold - that's why we're interested in it,'' Dr. Booth adds. So even though Britain's health-research budget is facing severe cuts, ''the auguries are tolerably good'' for the Salisbury unit. In fact, it is even conceivable that Harvard might still be in business long after its original enemy has been vanquished. Given the English taste for antiquity, the image is irresistible: Harvard Hospital as a kind of medical Stonehenge, a living memorial to the inquiring spirit, where the great-great grandchildren of the honeymooners who volunteererd to get conjugal colds in 1946 can travel to see the ancient prefab huts and sample, from laboratory vats, that primitive sniffling and coughing feeling they have read about - the once widespread, now uncommon, cold.
