That last question, or concern, is actually a matter of why Johnny isn't    allowed    to play football. The answer is, because he can't read or write. Or won't. At least in Jersey City. The Jersey City school board, in an effort to improve a deteriorating academic situation, tightened standards last summer for students participating in extracurricular activities in Grades 4 through 12. One of the consequences came about a week ago, after the first marking period this semester, when three Jersey City high schools - Snyder, Dickinson and Lincoln - had to cancel football games. Snyder was to have played in a northern state regional playoff, and the two other schools were to have met in a season-ending city- league game. But all three squads were depleted because half or nearly half the players had failed to make sufficient grades in the classroom.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Next, the notion that football is an extracurricular activity. Unlike other extracurricular pursuits, such as band or drama or student government (students with poor grades in Jersey City have been dropped in those areas, too), football is often treated in many parts of the country as if it bears greater significance, along the lines of life and death. Under the new requirements, Jersey City students must have a C average and no failing grades in any courses to take part in extracurricular activities. The state, in rules set by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association, requires only passing grades - including D's in most schools - in three courses each semester. ''We've had a decline in education in Jersey City for some 15 to 20 years,'' said Aaron Schulman, the president of the Jersey City school board, ''and the Board of Education decided we had to put a stop to it. For too long athletes have been pushed through the system without getting an education. They've been exploited.'' Why have they been exploited? Because, among other reasons, the national mythology in many instances has equated muscular prowess with divinity. Later, if they reach the college level, these gifted specimens are used to generate substantial sums of money. Attention in the media is centered early on the athletes. ''They are made to feel different from other students, even at the high school level,'' said Dr. Michael Ross, the superintendent of public schools in Jersey City. ''But then too many of the athletes leave school without the basic skills to make it in life after football,'' said Dr. Ross. ''That's exploitation. ''I do think the educational problems in Jersey City are comparable to those in most urban areas in the country. Absenteeism runs about 20 or 25 percent every day in the high schools. And when they take jobs, they miss work at the same rate. Patterns are established.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''I believe the kids are capable of doing better. We in public education just haven't been doing the job. We haven't been firm enough, and I take responsibility for being part of that system.

The kind of students he seems to be referring to are the kind of athletes who, at minimum, are capable of learning the plays in football. And what about the argument that stiffer requirements will discourage students who are athletes from continuing in school? ''It's a realistic problem,'' said Dr. Ross, ''except if kids go to school strictly to play games, then that's twisting the purpose of kids' coming to school at all. It's a good idea to use athletics as an inducement to education, but there is also an obligation while there: that is, to take your studies seriously.'' The action taken by the Jersey City school board appears part of the evolving concern about academics and athletics in high schools and colleges. Less than a year ago, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, dealing with academic difficulties among member schools, instituted rules that required of incoming athletes a minimum score on college-entrance examinations and upgraded high-school course requirements. The stiffer N.C.A.A. requirements have met with some resistance. Heads of some predominantly black schools have said that the new regulations are ''racist'' because, they contend, entrance tests often have built-in cultural biases. And, in the Jersey City high schools, there has been criticism from some athletes and some athletic directors, such as Bruce Dabney of Snyder, who contend that the ruling was ''too abrupt.'' One of those directly affected by the Jersey City ruling is Malcolm Christie, a 17-year-old, 6-foot- 7-inch, 285-pound tackle for Dickinson.

He has been a B student, usually does well in English and is also president of the senior class. He is an outstanding athlete and, he says, has scholarship offers from numerous schools, including Notre Dame, U.C.L.A. and Syracuse. ''I feel the stiffer requirements in high school here are necessary,'' he said. ''Failing English was totally my fault. I'm not going to use an excuse like the teacher didn't like me. And it's not that I couldn't do the work. I just didn't give it the proper study time. I think it's the same with most of the guys who didn't pass. ''We just can't be dumb jocks. I get tired of seeing black athletes coming out of school and they can't do anything. ''We want equality, and we're going to have to push ourselves to get it. ''I know I'm going to have to push myself.''    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
