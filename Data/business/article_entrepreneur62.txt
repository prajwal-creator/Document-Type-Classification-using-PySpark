One day Mr. Shen asked: What did they talk about? “The main thing I tell them about is always the same, how embarrassed I am about having criticized capitalism all my life, and here I am now, retired and appreciating it,” said the former high school teacher. She talked about receiving a free pair of eyeglasses for her failing vision; her husband, a retired professor of Chinese, got a hearing aid, courtesy of what the family considers a generous welfare system for the elderly in the United States. “My parents worked all their lives for China , and no one ever thought to take care of their eyes or ears,” Mr. Shen, 50, said in an interview. Mr. Shen’s book about his 21 years in the United States, called “America Is Also Ridiculous,” went on sale  in Shanghai on Tuesday before an enthusiastic crowd of  students and scholars at Fudan University. Prepublication reviews have been overwhelmingly positive, with endorsements from celebrities like the actor and film director Jiang Wen and the cult novelist Wang Shuo.

That book’s initial print run of 180,000 sold out quickly, feeding off a potent mixture of dislike and envy that characterizes anti-Americanism in a country where, for decades, people campaigned against the evils of Western imperialism.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       “America Is Also Ridiculous ” is actually a paean to a country Mr. Shen loves and admires. So why the provocative title? He grinned at the question. “There are many things about America that strike our traditional mind-set, me too, as ridiculous,” he said. “For example, sentencing a criminal to 180 years in jail. If he’s that bad, why not just shoot him? Who’s going to pay to keep him in jail?” Many Chinese also disapprove of U.S. gun laws. “They say people own 300 million guns there. To us, this is just crazy.” As China moves into its fourth decade of fast-paced economic reform, much is changing here. “China is getting more and more integrated with the outside world. People are getting more critical. I would say their understanding of America is getting more and more real,” said Mr. Shen. A kind of subtle confluence is taking shape. Americans, confidence badly shaken, fret about China’s seemingly unstoppable economic growth and wonder when their country will be challenged as the global superpower. Here in China, something else is happening: deeper understanding of democracy is producing greater admiration, in some quarters. The reason is simple, Mr. Shen said. “There is no perfect system. But if you have to choose between democracy and dictatorship, you must choose democracy, even with its many defects. Here we just don’t have the system to build up a modern civilization.” Over all, however, China’s attitude toward America is still polarized. “When we talk about the United States here in China, there have always been two extremes,” Mr. Shen said. “One side is completely anti-American, and the other is completely pro-American. These two sides have existed for a very long time and to get rid of them, well, there’s a long way to go. I don’t see any shortcuts to it.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

A radio journalist, he rejected the security of a state job for New York in 1989, working his way up from restaurant jobs to his present position as film entrepreneur and chairman of the China-U.S. Business Summit, based in Los Angeles. Mr. Shen’s is one of several recent Chinese books to capture this new phenomenon of what might be called critical admiration for America.

She is now a politics lecturer at the University of Cambridge, in England. Her book is intellectual as well as lively, referencing writers like Alexis de Tocqueville. It hasn’t hurt sales. In fact, the book is a hit. Published in June 2009, it has sold nearly 120,000 copies and is in its 17th print run, according to Shanghai Sanlian Shudian Press. Using vivid, personal details, Ms. Liu writes about a range of topics: disabled people in the United States winning fair treatment; how the legal system, though prone to excesses, regularly delivers justice; domestic opposition to the war in Iraq. She compares the individual stories to similar ones in China, where the outcomes are usually far worse, with civil society struggling for recognition, the legal system weak and criticism of leaders or policies banned. As Mr. Shen and Ms. Liu know, all of this closely relates to global politics and shifting power relations in this century, because cultural values guide what we do, even in the economy. Speaking in Geneva last month, Henry A. Kissinger warned that the United States and China risked confrontation unless they created “a pattern of continuous cooperation.” At the same International Institute for Strategic Studies event, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, James B. Steinberg, called on the two countries to build a relationship based on “strategic trust,” similar to the culturally based trust between Europe and the United States. Experts are skeptical. “I don’t see it developing, simply because the U.S. and China do not share fundamental values in common, either domestically or internationally,” said David Shambaugh, a politics professor at George Washington University. In her afterword, Ms. Liu writes, “For so many years, we spent so long judging the pros and cons of the ‘Western system,’ but we didn’t take the time to go and see what it really was.” By giving people a realistic picture of democracy that shows its merits to be greater than its flaws, she and Mr. Shen are contributing to the shared cultural trust policy makers hope to see.
