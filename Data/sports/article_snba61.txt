The team Williams now manages is hardly a threat to steal, let alone pose a threat to a stolen-base record. ''I stole a few bases,'' Williams said, recalling his playing career in the latter half of the 1960's. ''The biggest problem I had was that you can't steal first base.'' The Boston Red Sox, who this week begin their second of three home-and-home series with the Yankees, have had no trouble getting to first base, not to mention second, third and home, but they do not traverse the bases by stealing. Their 11 stolen bases and 16 attempted steals (before yesterday's games) are the fewest in the majors. The Yankees have two players, Chuck Knoblauch and Alfonso Soriano, who each have more stolen bases than the entire Red Sox team. The Yankees, who lead the majors in stolen bases with 50, have been caught virtually as many times (15) as the Red Sox have tried to steal.

''Maybe other teams or situations haven't dictated too much or maybe it's slide steps or left-handers like Pettitte or whatever. We don't have a lot of guys who are really burners out there. If you don't, why run into outs? I don't like to run into outs or take the bat out of the guy's hands when something good could happen.''  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Carl Everett leads Boston with six stolen bases in seven attempts. Chris Stynes has two stolen bases. Lou Merloni, Trot Nixon and Shea Hillenbrand have one each. Those three have been thrown out trying to steal once each, as has Troy O'Leary. ''I think the pitchers, with all their slide steps, have really cut down or curtailed a lot of running because you don't want to run into outs,'' Williams said. ''Everett can run really good, but you have Ramirez hitting behind him. Manny has stolen some bases, but he's had leg problems. Offerman has stolen bases in the past, but he's had some leg problems. Nomar's not here. He used to steal a few bases.'' Williams didn't say so, but he appeared to be suggesting that stolen bases are overrated. He would not be alone in that view. ''I've been saying that for years,'' Billy Beane, the Oakland Athletics' general manager, said. ''There's no correlation between runs scored and stolen bases.'' There would seem to be, on the other hand, a correlation between the infatuation with home runs and the decline of stolen bases. Some managers have also come to disdain stolen bases because of the risk involved. ''Maybe first to third, first to home, second to home, getting good jumps, reading balls are more important for us,'' Williams said. ''Do we want to get the run in or do we want to steal a base? You have to maintain your strengths, deal with your strengths. Base stealing as a group maybe isn't what we consider a real strength. Look for balls in the dirt to take those 90-foot sections.'' It's important, Williams said, for players to be able to express themselves on the field. ''I don't know what better feel you can have as a baseball player than to express your skills on this field, whether there's 50,000 people there or 5,'' he said. ''It's a game. You go out and play this game that you like to play. There are things you can do as a player to express yourself.''

Braves' Unusual Record The Atlanta Braves have not been over .500 since their fifth game of the season. Usually, in the past decade, it was the other way around; the Braves would not drop below .500 after their fifth game or so. In two seasons, 1994 and '98, the Braves never had more losses than victories. In 1999 they had a losing record only after the first game. Last year they experienced two such days, both in the first 11 games. They had two of those days, too, in 1995, both in the first 17 games. In the 1997 season, the Braves limited their losing record to the first three games. When was the last time they went this far with a losing record? It was eight division championships ago, in 1992. That season, the Braves struggled into June on the down side of .500, abandoning that unflattering position June 7 in the midst of a stretch in which they won 21 of 24 games.

Not that Kelly, the manager of the Minnesota Twins, should have any concerns these days, not with the Twins one of the few class teams in the American League. But it was not his team that was bothering Kelly. ''I heard some foolishness the other day about not wanting the manager or pitching coach to be able to make a visit to the mound,'' he said. ''Take that out and speed up the game. That's taking out an important part of the game that has an impact on winning and losing. We don't care about the length of the game.'' Managers may go to the mound to talk to a pitcher once without taking him out. The second visit in an inning to the same pitcher requires a change. Kelly cited a game against the Yankees as an example of the importance of allowing these visits. ''Joe Torre goes out to see Roger Clemens,'' Kelly related. ''They're winning, 2-0, and we have a man on in the eighth. He's saying: 'How we doing? You ready to get this guy out? You got something left for me?' He looked the guy in the eye. ''They want to eliminate that trip. When I heard that, I said that's ridiculous. That's a big part of the game. The pitching coach might be able to tell the pitcher something that will get him through a situation, win a game. Or you might go out to stall, which is part of the game. It's the strategy of the game.'' False alarm. ''There hasn't been any attempt to change that,'' said Sandy Alderson, the chief of baseball operations in the commissioner's office. ''It hasn't been discussed. To me, mound visits are a part of the game. You start limiting mound visits, you start changing the tenor of the game.''

Jose Lima of Houston allowed 48 home runs last season, eclipsing the record of 46 that Roberts set in 1956. Lima also tied a major league record by giving up four home runs in one inning. That's what Trachsel did last Thursday night, pitching for the Mets against the San Diego Padres. The Thursday night massacre raised Trachsel's total home runs to 13 in 39 1/3 innings and moved him into a tie with Curt Schilling of Arizona for the league lead. Schilling, however, has pitched 66 1/3 innings. As much as his latest performance did for his record-breaking bid, though, it also earned Trachsel a demotion to the minors. The Mets figure it worked for Bobby Jones last season so maybe there's a minor miracle awaiting them with his replacement. That's right. Trachsel is the pitcher the Mets signed for two years for the amount ($7 million) that Jones wanted for each year of a three-year contract. While Jones has been pitching with remarkable effectiveness for the Padres, Trachsel is trying to make history with the Mets. The banishment to the minors could impede his chances. He was shooting not only for Lima's N.L. record but also the major league record of 50 set by Bert Blyleven in 1986. To break that one, Trachsel, at his rate in his first eight starts, would have to pitch an additional 115 major league innings when he returns. The number of innings Trachsel had pitched is what attracted the Mets to him. He had worked 200 innings in each of the previous five seasons. But in his eight starts with the Mets the battered right-hander has averaged 4.9 innings. To reach 200 with that average, a pitcher would have to make 41 starts, something no one has done since Phil Niekro started 44 times in 1979. Ten 1-0 Games Ten games (entering the weekend) have finished with a 1-0 score. Half were decided by a home run. Paul O'Neill hit the decisive blow for the Yankees against Kansas City, and B. J. Surhoff did so for Atlanta against Milwaukee. The Dodgers won the other three, and Gary Sheffield homered each time -- against Milwaukee, Florida and Atlanta.
