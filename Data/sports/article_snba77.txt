Don't hate me because I'm beautiful. Always a bridesmaid but never a bride. Fly me! I dreamed I barged down the Nile in my Maidenform bra. Does she . . . or doesn't she? For more than 100 years, Madison Avenue has been placing women in the center  ring of the cacophonous circus known as the American consumerist society. The development of mass-produced products in the late 19th century required that women, as the primary shoppers, be tutored in the purported problems of urbanized life, from halitosis to B. O., and the benefits that name brands claimed in solving those supposed woes. As advertising was increasingly aimed at women, women often became the focus of it. They were presented as symbols of disparate ideals, from purity (Psyche,  the White Rock girl) to pleasure (Jean Harlow endorsing Lucky Strike cigarettes) to protection ("The greatest mother in the world" for the Red Cross). The process by which advertisers and agencies have reflected, influenced and  altered the ways women buy, dress and behave -- as well as the changing attitudes by which ads are judged -- is the subject of an exhibit, "Dream Girls: Images of Women in Advertising," by the American Advertising Museum in Portland, Ore. The exhibit, traveling across the country, is on display in Manhattan through Nov. 22 at the Art Directors Club, 250 Park Avenue South, between 19th and 20th Streets.

There are also re-creations of a 1950's kitchen -- with a Frigidaire stove and a pantry of products like Tide, "the washday miracle" -- and a 60's beauty parlor featuring  hair dryers mounted on chairs with ashtrays in the armrests.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The ads are arranged by decade and by what Jan Kurtz, national director of the museum, described as the five female icons: homemaker, independent woman, love tutor, sex kitten and superwoman. "Advertising can't work without a stereotypical depiction and a fantasy," Ms. Kurtz said this week in an interview as the exhibit was being installed at the club. Otherwise, she added, marketers cannot accomplish the goal of "having us aspire to a higher standard of living than we can quite afford." The exhibit, which draws upon "Advertising the American Dream: Making Way for Modernity" by Roland Marchand (University of California Press, 1985), seeks to place sales pitches in their cultural, historical and social contexts. "Advertising that was acceptable in its time is now perceived as condescending," said Myrna Davis, executive director of the club, gesturing to the exhibit. For instance, an ad from the 60's for Coty Emeraude perfume asks: "Want him to be more of a man? Try being more of a woman."

Advertising taught women "to sanitize, standardize  and beautify" by buying branded goods. An ad for the Kellogg Company, for example, portrayed an assertive woman lecturing her grocer: "Excuse me. I know what I want, and I want what I asked for, Toasted Corn Flakes. Good day." 1920's.  This was the decade when agencies learned "how to sell the dream rather than the product." The flapper became the epitome of free-spirited -- and free-spending -- womanhood in campaigns for cigarettes, hosiery, even automobiles. 1930's.  The Depression ushered in hard-selling campaigns that portrayed women as obsessed with domestic concerns but also offered celebrities as emblems of attainable glamor. 1940's.  Propaganda sold women on war work, then steered them back into traditional roles after V-J Day. Rosie the Riveter gave way to a child asking, "Mother, when will you stay home again?"   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   1950's.  Advertising "idealized the domestic sphere and women as its guardian,"  though marketers like Maidenform also offered them "vicarious dreams as they returned to domestic life." The world of work was epitomized by Dinah Shore belting out "See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet" and a Westinghouse pitchwoman whose refrigerator door stuck during a live commercial. 1960's.  "The creative revolution met the sexual revolution" as campaigns imbued with the soft sell portrayed independent women. But homemakers still implored their husbands to "Take Me Along" on United business flights and were often the  targets of cruel humor; one Volkswagen Bus ad asked, "Do you have the right kind of wife for it?" 1970's.  The rise of the superwoman -- the flapper redux -- was tempered by the  continuing popularity of homemakers and sex kittens. 1980's and 90's.  Agencies learned to "ally themselves with feminist sensibilities" as they tried to "intrigue the bored consumer." The Charlie fragrance woman patted a man on his rear end while girls in spots for Nike footwear proclaimed that athletics would change their lives. A symposium in conjunction with the exhibit is scheduled for 6 P.M. to 8 P.M. on Wednesday at the Cooper Union Great Hall, 7th Street and Third Avenue in Manhattan.
