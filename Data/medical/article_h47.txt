Visit this page to see the latest.    It has happened yet again: Inevitably, predictably, fatefully, a gunman shot dead 26 people in a Texas church on Sunday. These incidents are peculiarly American tragedies, and what’s particularly heartbreaking is that they aren’t shocking. People all over the world become furious and try to harm others, but only in the United States do we suffer such mass shootings so regularly; only in the U.S. do we lose one person every 15 minutes to gun violence.    Two of the deadliest mass shootings in modern American history have occurred in the last six weeks. So let’s not just mourn the dead, let’s not just lower flags and make somber speeches. Let’s also learn lessons from these tragedies, so that there can be fewer of them. In particular, I suggest that we try a new approach to reducing gun violence – a public health strategy.    America Has More Guns Than Any Other Country    The first step is to understand the scale of the challenge America faces: The U.S. has more than 300 million guns – roughly one for every citizen – and stands out as well for its gun death rates. At the other extreme, Japan has less than one gun per 100 people, and typically fewer than 10 gun deaths a year in the entire country.                     Guns per 100 people    The United States stands alone among developed countries: It has by far the highest rate of firearms ownership.    88.8    United States    45.7    switzerland    31.6    Sweden    31.2    france    30.8    canada    30.3    germany    15.0    Australia    11.9    italy    10.4    spain    6.2    England, wales    0.6    Japan    Gun murders per 100,000 people    America’s private arsenal is six times as lethal as Canada’s, and 30 times worse than Australia’s.    3.00    United States    0.7    Italy    0.5    Canada    0.3    Sweden    0.2    Germany    0.2    Switzerland    0.1    Australia    0.1    England, Wales    0.1    france    0.1    Spain    0    Japan        Guns per 100 people    The United States stands alone among developed countries: It has by far the highest rate of firearms ownership.    88.8    United States    45.7    switzerland    31.6    Sweden    31.2    france    30.8    canada    30.3    germany    15.0    Australia    11.9    italy    10.4    spain    6.2    England, wales    0.6    Japan    Gun murders per 100,000 people    America’s private arsenal is six times as lethal as Canada’s, and 30 times worse than Australia’s.    3.0    United States    0.7    Italy    0.5    Canada    0.3    Sweden    0.2    Germany    0.2    Switzerland    0.1    Australia    0.1    England, Wales    0.1    france    0.1    Spain    0    Japan            The New York Times | Sources: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (gun murders); Small Arms Survey (guns per 100 people)  | Murder data for U.S., Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia and Spain from 2015 and latest available for other countries; 2007 data for guns per 100 people.      We Have a Model for Regulating Guns: Automobiles    Gun enthusiasts often protest: Cars kill about as many people as guns, and we don’t ban them! No, but automobiles are actually a model for the public health approach I’m suggesting.    We don’t ban cars, but we work hard to regulate them – and limit access to them – so as to reduce the death toll they cause. This has been spectacularly successful, reducing the death rate per 100 million miles driven by 95 percent since 1921.    Take a look at the history of motor vehicle safety since World War II:                     Deaths per 100 million vehicle  miles traveled    1946    9.35    8    1968    First federal safety standards for cars    6    4    2016    2    1.18    ’50s    ’60s    ’70s    ’80s    ’90s    ’00s    ’10s        Deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled    1946    9.35    1950     1968     First seatbelt offered  in an American car    First federal safety  standards for cars    8    1974    55 m.p.h. national  speed limit    1993    Car safety ratings  introduced    6    1978    Tennessee is first  to require child safety  seats    1999    Airbags, invented  in 1951, become mandatory    1984    4    New York is first to require seat belt use    2000    Mandatory reporting  of defects by  carmakers    2016    2    1.18    ’46    ’50s    ’60s    ’70s    ’80s    ’90s    2000s    ’10s    ’16            The New York Times | Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration      The Liberal Approach Is Ineffective. Use a Public Health Approach Instead.    Frankly, liberal opposition to guns has often been ineffective, and sometimes counterproductive. The 10-year ban on assault weapons accomplished little, partly because definitions were about cosmetic features like bayonet mounts (and partly because even before the ban, such guns were used in only 2 percent of crimes).    The left sometimes focuses on “gun control,” which scares off gun owners and leads to more gun sales. A better framing is “gun safety” or “reducing gun violence,” and using auto safety as a model—constant efforts to make the products safer and to limit access by people who are most likely to misuse them.    What would a public health approach look like for guns if it were modeled after cars? It would include:       Background Checks  22 percent of guns are obtained without one.      Protection Orders  Keep men who are subject to domestic violence protection orders from having guns.      Ban Under-21s  A ban on people under 21 purchasing firearms (this is already the case in many states).      Safe Storage  These include trigger locks as well as guns and ammunition stored separately, especially when children are in the house.      Straw Purchases  Tighter enforcement of laws on straw purchases of weapons, and some limits on how many guns can be purchased in a month.      Ammunition Checks  Experimentation with a one-time background check for anybody buying ammunition.      End Immunity  End immunity for firearm companies. That’s a subsidy to a particular industry.      Ban Bump Stocks  A ban on bump stocks of the kind used in Las Vegas to mimic automatic weapon fire.      Research ‘Smart Guns’  “Smart guns” fire only after a fingerprint or PIN is entered, or if used near a particular bracelet.       If someone steals my iPhone, it’s useless, and the same should be true of guns. Gun manufacturers made child-proof guns back in the 19th century (before dropping them), and it’s time to advance that technology today. Some combination of smart guns and safe storage would also reduce the number of firearms stolen in the U.S. each year, now about 200,000, and available to criminals.    We also need to figure out whether gun buybacks, often conducted by police departments, are cost-effective and help reduce violence. And we can experiment more with anti-gang initiatives, such as Cure Violence, that have a good record in reducing shootings.    Fewer Guns = Fewer Deaths    In Texas on Sunday, it seems that a man living near the church grabbed his gun and confronted the shooter after he left the church. It may be that this defensive use of a weapon saved lives, and the N.R.A. often hails this view that guns are necessary to counter gun violence.    But really? Can anybody possibly see what unfolded in Texas as a success of gun policy?    It is true that guns are periodically used defensively. One study by the Violence Policy Center found that in 2012 there were 259 justifiable homicides by a private citizen using a firearm.

But the problem is that lax laws too often  make it easy not only for good guys to get guns, but also for bad guys to get guns. The evidence is overwhelming that overall more guns and more relaxed gun laws lead to more violent deaths and injuries. One study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that a gun in the house was associated with an increased risk of a gun death, particularly by suicide but also apparently by homicide.    In 2015, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas tweeted that he was “ embarrassed ” that his state was ranked second (behind California) in requests to buy new guns, albeit still with one million requests. “Let’s pick up the pace Texans,” he wrote. Abbott apparently believes, along with the N.R.A., that more guns make a society more safe, but statistics dispute that. Abbott should look at those charts.

Let's pick up the pace Texans. @NRA  10:53 AM - 28 Oct 2015     Mass Shootings Are Not the Main Cause of Loss of Life    Critics will say that the kind of measures I cite wouldn’t prevent many shootings. The Las Vegas carnage, for example, might not have been prevented by any of the suggestions I make.    That’s true, and there’s no magic wand available. Yet remember that although it is mass shootings that get our attention, they are not the main cause of loss of life. Much more typical is a friend who shoots another, a husband who kills his wife – or, most common of all, a man who kills himself. Skeptics will say that if people want to kill themselves, there’s nothing we can do. In fact, it turns out that if you make suicide a bit more difficult, suicide rates drop.    Here are the figures showing that mass shootings are a modest share of the total, and the same is true of self-defense – despite what the N.R.A. might have you believe.

Gun laws have been loosened in many parts of the country.

In 1995, Connecticut tightened licensing laws, while in 2007 Missouri  eased gun laws.    The upshot? After tightening gun laws, firearm homicide rates dropped 40 percent in Connecticut. And after Missouri eased gun laws, gun homicide rates rose 25 percent.

A car or gun is usually safe in the hands of a 45-year-old woman with no criminal record, but may be dangerous when used by a 19-year-old felon with a history of alcohol offenses or domestic violence protection orders.    Yet our laws have often focused more on weapons themselves (such as the assault weapons ban) rather than on access. In many places, there is more rigorous screening of people who want to adopt dogs than of people who want to purchase firearms.    In these two states, the laws affected access, and although there’s some indication that other factors were also involved in Connecticut (and correlations don’t prove causation), the outcomes are worth pondering.    There Is a Shocking Lack of Research on Guns    There’s simply a scandalous lack of research on gun violence, largely because the N.R.A. is extremely hostile to such research and Congress rolls over. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did try to research gun violence, Congress responded by cutting its funding.    Here is the American toll from four diseases and firearms over the years 1973-2012 – and the number of National Institutes of Health research grants to explore each problem over that same time.

As a 13-year-old farm boy in Oregon, I attended a N.R.A. gun safety class (which came with a one-year membership to the N.R.A., making me an N.R.A. alum who despises what that organization has become). These classes can be very useful, and audits found that more than 80 percent cover such matters as checking the gun to see if it’s loaded, keeping one’s finger off the trigger until ready to fire and being certain of the target.    Yet the audits also suggest that trainers are more likely to advocate for the N.R.A. or for carrying guns than for, say, safe storage. This is a missed opportunity, for all classes should cover the risks of guns and alcohol, the risks of abuse with suicide and domestic violence, the need for safe storage, and so on. Here’s what researchers found that the gun classes they audited actually covered:                     NOT  DISCUSSED    PERCENT OF CLASSES  WHERE DISCUSSED    Trainers encouraged  gun carrying    81%    19    Encouraged  gun ownership    76    24    Prevent unsupervised  access by children    70    30    Encouraged gun use  for self-defense    69    31    60    40    Ricochet    60    40    Theft prevention    Encouraged membership  in gun-rights group    56    44    Legal ramifications of  shooting in self-defense    55    45    53    47    Child access laws    Recommendation: when  not in use, store unloaded    50    50    Recommendation: use  gun only as last resort    45    55    Young children  and gun accidents    55    45    70    30    Decision-making in crises    Theft is important source  of firearms used in crime    80    20    Techniques for  de-escalating threats    85    15    Recommendation:  report stolen firearms    90    10    Watch for signs of suicide  in household members    90    10    90    10    Domestic violence risk        Topic  discussed    Percent of classes  where discussed    Not  discussed    Trainers encouraged gun carrying    19    81%    Encouraged gun ownership    24    76    Prevent unsupervised access by children    30    70    Encouraged gun use for self-defense    31    69    Ricochet    40    60    Theft prevention    40    60    Encouraged membership in gun-rights group    44    56    Legal ramifications of shooting in self-defense    45    55    Child access laws    47    53    Recommendation: when not in use, store unloaded    50    50    Recommendation: use gun only as last resort    55    45    Young children and gun accidents    55    45    Decision-making in crises    70    30    Theft is an important source of firearms used in crime    80    20    Techniques for de-escalating threats    85    15    Recommendation: report stolen firearms    90    10    Watch for signs of suicide in household members    90    10    Domestic violence risk    90    10            The New York Times | Source: David Hemenway, Injury Prevention  | The classes studied, some of which were required by law, took place in 7 Northeast states.      A Way Forward: On Some Issues, Majorities Agree    It may sometimes seem hopeless to make progress on gun violence, especially with the N.R.A. seemingly holding Congress hostage. But I’m more optimistic.    Look, we all agree on some kinds of curbs on guns. Nobody believes that people should be able to drive a tank down Main Street, or have an anti-aircraft gun in the backyard. I’ve been to parts of northern Yemen where one could actually buy a tank or an anti-aircraft gun, as well as fully automatic weapons — and that area’s now embroiled in a civil war – but fortunately in America we have agreed to ban those kinds of weaponry.    So the question isn’t whether we will restrict firearms, but where to draw the line and precisely which ones to restrict.    Check out these polling numbers as a basis for action on gun safety:                     Agree with  the following:    Households  with no guns    Gun  households    50%    Background checks  for all gun buyers    93%    96%    Preventing mentally  ill from buying guns    89    89    Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes    88    85    Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists    82    84    Background checks for private sales and at gun shows    77    87    Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases    72    89    Ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun    67    79    A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence    61    75    New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns    57    71    Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence    56    81    Creating a federal database to track gun sales    54    80    A ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines  (10+ bullets)*    52    77        Households  with no guns    Gun  households    Agree with the following:    50%    93%    Background checks for all gun buyers    96%    89    Preventing the mentally ill from buying guns    89    Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes    88    85    Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists    82    84    Background checks for private sales and at gun shows    77    87    Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases    72    89    A ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun    67    79    A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence    61    75    New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns    57    71    Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence    56    81    Creating a federal database to track gun sales    54    80    A ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines (10+ bullets)*    52    77            The New York Times | Sources: Pew Research Center survey conducted in March and April (questions on mental illness, no-fly lists, background checks for private sales and federal database); Quinnipiac University National Poll conducted Oct. 5-10 (all other questions)  | *A Pew Research Center survey found only 44 percent of gun owners favored such a ban.      Looking ahead, I’m optimistic that there can be progress at the state level, and some of the necessary research funding will come from private foundations. Maybe some police departments will put in orders for smart guns to help create a market.    But the real impetus for change will come because the public favors it. In particular, note that 93 percent of people even in gun households favor universal background checks for gun purchases.       The terrible truth is that Wednesday’s school shooting was 100 percent predictable. So is the next one. After each such incident, we mourn the deaths and sympathize with the victims, but we do nothing fundamental to reduce our vulnerability.    Some of you will protest (as President Trump did the last time) that it’s too soon to talk about guns, or that it is disrespectful to the dead to use such a tragedy to score political points. Yet more Americans have died from gun violence, including suicides, since 1970 (about 1.4 million) than in all the wars in American history going back to the Revolutionary War (about 1.3 million). And it’s not just gang members: In a typical year, more preschoolers are shot dead in America (about 75) than police officers are.    Yes, making America safer will be hard: There are no perfect solutions. The Second Amendment is one constraint, and so is our polarized political system and the power of the gun lobby. There’s a lot of talk about banning assault weapons, for example, but the 10-year assault weapons ban didn’t accomplish much for reducing gun violence, partly because defining assault weapons proved to be much more complex than anybody had anticipated (in the end, the definition depended partly on cosmetic features). And new restrictions have limited effectiveness because we have delayed so long that there are already so many guns out there. So it’s unclear how effective some of my suggestions will be, and in any case this will be a long, uncertain, uphill process.    But automobiles are a reminder that we can chip away at a large problem through a public health approach: Just as auto safety improvements have left us far better off, it seems plausible to some gun policy experts that a sensible, politically feasible set of public health steps could over time reduce firearm deaths in America by one-third — or more than 10,000 lives saved each year.    So let’s not just shed tears for the dead, give somber speeches and lower flags. Let’s get started and save lives. Let’s not accept that school classrooms can turn any moment into war zones.
