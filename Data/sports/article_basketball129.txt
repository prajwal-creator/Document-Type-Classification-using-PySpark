Next Question?  Riff Raff at Santos Party House   By JON CARAMANICA SEPT. 2, 2012     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           The Riff Raff concert on Thursday night at Santos Party House began with a news conference, podium and all, except it wasn’t nearly a news conference. It was after midnight in a sweaty, crowded nightclub, and Riff Raff, wearing a pink neon windbreaker, mostly took banal questions from the crowd: Will Riff Raff bring the rice out? “Rice shall be brought.” (More on the rice later.) Does Riff Raff play basketball? “I hoop so good I damn near could’ve been Sheryl Swoopes.” These are farcical answers to inane questions, or, viewed another way, one small act in a very long play. There’s nothing transparent about Riff Raff, one of the most indelibly eccentric figures in contemporary hip-hop, engaged in either a grand act of performance art, or an equally grand act of outsider art. He is a character, through and through. He rebuffs efforts to draw out the details of his past. There may not be anything on the inside. But what’s on the outside is deliciously absurd, often transfixingly interesting and sometimes actually great. Riff Raff is a white rapper originally from the Houston area with awesomely lustrous hair, a thin stripe of beard sometimes cut in a way that resembles an EKG, and tattoos that include the logos of BET and MTV. (He was once a contestant on “From G’s to Gents,” an MTV reality competition in which Fonzworth Bentley tried to spiff up a gaggle of hip-hop hoodlums.)

And like Lil B he’s cultivated his own shorthand and lingo. Like “bringing the rice out,” which in one version refers to cocaine, but in another is equivalent to living over the top. When he puts words together, it’s seemingly at random, and almost always fantastical: a game of Mad Libs come to life.

When the pixie-rap starlet Kitty Pryde arrived, within days Riff Raff was on a plane to Daytona Beach to record “Orion’s Belt,” a deliriously amusing song and video with her. Similarly, not long after the menacing young Chicago rapper Chief Keef began to achieve YouTube infamy, there was Riff Raff, partnering with him for “Cuz My Gear,” one of the year’s oddest collaborations. Chief Keef is a literalist, all square jaw and mean thoughts. Riff Raff is something else, opening the song like this: Holograms on my hand gave me a tan wrist Diamonds dancing on my fist look like a blank disc Teriyaki soup with the lemon Fanta  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He performed that last during this concert, capping a bizarre show that began with that news conference and lasted maybe 20 minutes, including a midset intermission. He wore a headset microphone that he sometimes rapped into and sometimes used to obscure the fact that he wasn’t rapping at all. His hype man wore a T-shirt with an airbrushed image of Riff Raff’s face on it.

His best songs have unlikely, catchy choruses: “Deion Sandals” was a high point here, as was “Lil Mama I’m Sorry.” Only “Hologram Benz,” a blowzy dubstep track from his recent mixtape “Birth of an Icon,” was an obvious misstep. Riff Raff recently signed with Mad Decent, the label of Diplo, the genre-crossing producer, which means that at least one part of his character is becoming etched in stone: He’s a rapper, not merely a cut-from-whole-cloth personality who uses rap as one of many mediums. Songs, albums, the money that changes hands in a record deal, those are tangible things, not fantastical ones. This year Riff Raff suggested that the character played by James Franco in the coming Harmony Korine film “Spring Breakers” was based on him (and that he was initially offered the role). In a subsequent interview Mr. Franco rebuffed the notion. When James Franco is casting aspersions on your relationship to truth, you must be existing well beyond known boundaries. But Riff Raff is an inventor above all. Certainly Mr. Franco knows a kindred spirit when he sees one, but if it’s true that he’ll be playing a version of Riff Raff — a character based on a character — will Riff Raff himself cease to exist? No one asked him that.   A version of this review appears in print on September 3, 2012, on Page C2 of the New York edition with the headline: Is Riff Raff Eccentric? Yes. Next Question?.
