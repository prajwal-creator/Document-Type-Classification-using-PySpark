Bill Clinton to capture today in New York State, while Republicans in a variety of races worked just as hard to avoid being swept away in a local Democratic landslide. From a United States Senate race that has become the costliest and possibly the nastiest in the nation, to the struggle for control of the State Legislature in Albany, the Democrats' expected strong showing at the top of the ticket was having a marked impact on campaigns all the way down the ballot. State Attorney General Robert Abrams, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, and his Republican opponent, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, both stumped the state in last-minute drives for votes.  [ Articles, page B1. ] Mr. Abrams cast himself as an inexorable part of the Clinton-Gore team that he believes should go to Washington. Mr. D'Amato played down the effects on his campaign of a possible Clinton victory in New York and assured voters that it was fine to vote for the Democratic Presidential nominee and then for him.

Koch of New York City, on radio commercials to say, "I'm voting for Bill Clinton and Al D'Amato."  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The Republican flight from the Bush-Quayle ticket was also evident in a New York City race for Congress, where Representative Bill Green, a Manhattan Republican, ran television commercials that flash a newspaper endorsement of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Abrams, both Democrats, and then of himself.  Legislative Races And Democrats were hoping that their strength at the top of the ticket might extend to state legislative races, where they are looking for the five victories they need to take back control of the 61-member State Senate. Several Democratic Senate candidates, aiming for a long stretch of Mr. Clinton's coattails, have distributed literature linking themselves to the Clinton-Gore ticket. The Democrats swept to control of the State Assembly in the anti-Republican, Watergate-inspired year of 1974, but they still face an uphill climb in the State Senate this year. The Republicans, who have controlled that chamber for the last 27 years, drew districts to their advantage during this year's reapportionment and have poured money and workers into races where their incumbents, including the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino of Oyster Bay, L.I., are seen as at all vulnerable. At an upstate airport campaign stop in Broome County, Mr. D'Amato was asked whether a Clinton victory in New York today would help Mr. Abrams win the race for Senate. "I don't think so," Mr. D'Amato replied. "Here in New York, we have some sophisticated voters who are not afraid to split the ticket. We're going to win it in upstate New York." After years of relatively low voter turnout, intense interest in the Presidential race has fueled a surge in voter registration in New York, although few analysts expect it to result in a turnout rivaling the modern-day record of 75 percent in the 1960 Presidential election won by John F. Kennedy. The State Board of Elections announced yesterday that 9,193,391 New Yorkers were registered to vote, just 14,000 below the record set in 1972, the year after 18-year-olds where first allowed to register. More than a million New Yorkers have signed up to vote in the last four months, clearly one of the largest short-term increases in state history, the board said. It could not provide a breakdown at this point of how many of the new registrants were Democrats, who have long outnumbered Republicans by roughly three to two in New York, but it noted that more than 50 percent of the new registrants were in heavily Democratic New York City.

Showers in Forecast One of the classic vagaries behind voting patterns, of course, is the weather, and it is not expected to be nice, at least in the early part of the day: forecasters predicted some showers and temperatures in the low 50's across most of New York State. And even as politicians were predicting a heavy Democratic turnout for the Presidential race, there were some indications in polls and interviews with voters in recent days that voter disgust with the tenor of the United States Senate campaign in New York could cause more than the usual drop-off in voting from the top of the ticket.

Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. But he said that this year his polling indicated the drop-off could be larger. As if to dramatize the potential closeness of the Senate race, Mr. Abrams plans to continue campaigning on Election Day, driving to Port Washington, L.I., at 6 A.M. and taking a commuter train back. He then planned to continue campaigning in the city throughout the day. "We want to get every last vote," he said. Cuomo Supporting Bond Act Aside from the wide range of political races, the Democratic effort to turn out the vote also focused on a proposition on the ballot: the $800 million Jobs for the New, New York Bond Act, which would use public borrowing to create thousands of jobs with infrastructure and repair projects. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, for whom the bond act is the centerpiece of his program to help New York out of the recession, campaigned for it on Long Island and at a Manhattan construction site even as he continued to fight off a touch of the flu. The Democratic Governor has had to contend with heavy opposition from conservative groups and from State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, a Republican, who have warned that the bond act will add unacceptably to the state's debt. The overall get-out-the-vote drive included saturation of the airwaves with commercials, especially for Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Abrams, who together will have spent about $15 million on their race, as well as the more traditional telephone appeals to voters from squads of party employees and volunteers. For the Democrats, the phone effort was bolstered with similar efforts by large Democratic-leaning labor groups.  A Telephone Message The telephone calls in recent weeks by both parties appear to have totaled in the hundreds of thousands, although not all of them have provided accurate voting information.

Maloney, who is running for Congress. But the Democratic Congressional candidate in their district is actually Jerrold Nadler. Even with the strenuous efforts made by both major parties to get out the vote, interviews with several voters in New York City and the suburbs in recent days suggested that in many races, most particularly the Senate contest, voters are still struggling with considerable uncertainty and unhappiness over the tone of the campaigning.  Troubled by Senate Race Dolores Anderson, who has lived in Springfield Gardens, Queens, for the last 28 years, said she was definitely voting for Mr. Clinton but was troubled by the Democratic nominee for Senate, Mr. Abrams. "That's the only one that's hard," she said. "I never vote Republican, but I am not going to leave it blank, so I guess I'll go with D'Amato. A lot of people are saying they are going to leave that one blank." Everton Rogers of Harlem, a custodian for the Postal Service, said he was motivated most of all to vote for a local Assembly candidate, Keith Wright, who has plastered the Harlem area with posters urging voters to "Do the Right Thing." But, said Mr. Rogers, "I'm none too thrilled with any of the national guys," meaning both the Presidential and Senate candidates.  A Sax-Playing Supporter And while many people could be found sporting buttons on behalf of a candidate, the most unusual election-time garb in Central Park probably belonged to 34-year-old Frank Greco of Manhattan, who was roller skating through the park in a black jump suit with the single word "Vote" stenciled across his back. As he skated, Mr. Greco, a restuarant maitre d', held a saxophone aloft, playing a John Coltrane version of "My Favorite Things" and a lot of other songs. But even though he is a Clinton supporter and his act evoked the Arkansas Governor's famed sax-playing appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show," Mr. Greco said he was more interested in encouraging people to vote than in specifically encouraging them to vote Democratic. "I'm just doing this on my own," said Mr. Greco. "We have to express ourselves, and voting is a form of self-expression."    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
