Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, announced Friday that he was resigning, and he expressed grave concern about the threat of a global flu epidemic and the possibility of a terrorist attack on the nation's food supply. "For the life of me," he said, "I cannot understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do." Mr. Thompson's departure was the latest indication of how President Bush intends to shape his cabinet in his second term. A senior administration official said Friday that Mr. Bush had asked Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to stay in his position, a sign that the president intends to stick with his military strategy in Iraq and in the fight against terrorism. [Page A14.] Mr. Thompson, freed from the constraints of administration policy, gave candid, unexpected answers to questions posed to him at a news conference at his department.

The White House and Republicans in Congress have insisted that the government should not have that power because it would lead to price controls, reducing the revenues that drug companies need for research.

Critics of the Food and Drug Administration have long called for such an office. After initially opposing the idea, Bush administration officials and managers at the F.D.A. have said they will examine any proposals. Dr. Mark B. McClellan, the federal official in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, is the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Thompson, administration officials said. Dr. McClellan, a physician and an economist, worked at the White House in the first two years of the Bush administration and was commissioner of food and drugs from November 2002 to February of this year. His brother Scott is the White House press secretary. Mr. Thompson said Dr. McClellan "would be a great secretary." But Mr. Thompson said that the deputy secretary, Claude A. Allen, and Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat, were also qualified. In addition, Mr. Thompson said he had heard that Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, was interested in the job. Mr. Thompson, 63, the eighth member of the Bush cabinet to resign since the election, said he tried to resign a year ago but agreed to stay at the White House's request. Now, he said, after 20 years in the Wisconsin Legislature, 14 years as governor and four years as secretary, "it's time for me and my family to move on to the next chapter in our life." He said he wanted to work in the private sector, but would stay in office until Feb. 4 or until the Senate confirmed a successor. Kevin W. Keane, a spokesman for Mr. Thompson, said the secretary simply "went with the flow" at the news conference, offering candid responses to a wide range of questions. Before leaving office, Mr. Keane said, Mr. Thompson wants to issue a plan to "beef up our ability to review the safety of drugs after they have been approved."

"This is a really huge bomb that could adversely impact on the health care of the world," killing 30 million to 70 million people, he said.

"We are importing a lot of food from the Middle East and it would be easy to tamper with that," he said. He called for better technologies to detect contamination. Mr. Thompson said his greatest accomplishment was to secure passage of a bill adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare, the federal insurance program for 41 million people who are elderly or disabled. This, he said, was "the most historic improvement in Medicare since it was created in 1965." The new law prohibits the government from negotiating prices with drug companies on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. But Mr. Thompson said, "I would like to have had the opportunity to negotiate." He learned the value of such negotiations in 2001, when the nation was responding to anthrax attacks. Mr. Thompson negotiated with the maker of Cipro, an antibiotic used to treat anthrax, to obtain the drug for 95 cents a tablet, far less than the $1.77 the government had been paying. Mr. Thompson was a conservative Republican but also a pragmatist, more interested in solving problems than in scoring political points. Democrats liked him because they saw him as an advocate for domestic programs in an administration that seemed to devote more attention to foreign and military policy. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, often disagreed with Mr. Thompson, but said it had been a privilege to work with him. "He's always been a straight shooter, was always willing to try to tackle issues objectively, and always had good ideas and a common touch," Mr. Kennedy said.

And our department takes great pride in being your Department of Compassion." The department has more than 60,000 employees and spent $543 billion in the last year, accounting for nearly one-fourth of the federal budget. Mr. Thompson listed accomplishments of his tenure: The number of community health centers has increased. Immunization rates for children have reached a record high. The government has increased its defense against bioterrorist attacks and its ability to respond to public health emergencies. Asked if he might run for governor of Wisconsin, Mr. Thompson said: "It's entirely possible. I happen to love politics. Why would I say no?" Also, "there's a Senate seat open," he said, alluding to the seat now held by Herb Kohl, a Democrat. The terms of Mr. Kohl and the current governor of Wisconsin, James E. Doyle, also a Democrat, expire in January 2007.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
