You can throw all your pitches with more confidence and get up on the strike zone.” Darin Erstad, a former Angel, hit a two-run homer in the third, but Escobar (2-1) held the White Sox in check after that. He left after walking Ryan Sweeney with two outs in the eighth. Francisco Rodríguez came in and struck out Erstad, then pitched the ninth for his eighth save in nine chances. Izturis led off the fourth with his first home run of the season, and Guerrero followed with his seventh to tie the score, 2-2. Izturis drove in the go-ahead run with a single in the fifth before leaving with tightness in his right hamstring. Erick Aybar replaced him at second base.

It was the second consecutive win for Carmona (2-1) after a personal 11-game losing streak.

After Travis Hafner was called out on strikes, Víctor Martínez lined a two-run single to right for a 2-0 lead. TIGERS 4, TWINS 3 Brandon Inge led off the ninth with a home run for host Detroit. Inge, who entered the game batting .122, had three hits, including the winning drive into the left-field stands against Jesse Crain (1-2) in the ninth. Todd Jones (1-1), the third Tigers pitcher, got the win with a perfect ninth inning. Johan Santana gave up three runs and eight hits in six innings for Minnesota, including two home runs for the first time this season.

While Baek overpowered Kansas City for six innings, the Mariners managed just four hits against Brian Bannister (0-1). Bloomquist’s double came on a rare second chance. He fouled off a 3-2 pitch, but the ball lodged behind catcher John Buck’s chest protector. Buck tried to jog off the field, claiming the inning was over, but the umpire said that a batter is not out if the ball is caught in the catchers’ equipment or clothing, unless it hits the catcher’s hand or glove first. Bloomquist lined the next pitch into center field. BLUE JAYS 7, RANGERS 3 Alex Rios homered and Tomo Ohka pitched seven innings to win his second straight start for host Toronto. Aaron Hill went 3 for 4 and drove in two runs. Ian Kinsler hit a two-run homer in the ninth. It was his ninth home run of the season, tying the team record for April. Iván Rodríguez (2000), Alex Rodriguez (2002) and Carl Everett (2003) also accomplished the feat. DEVIL RAYS 5, ATHLETICS 3 Rocco Baldelli and Elijah Dukes hit back-to-back home runs for visiting Tampa Bay. B. J. Upton hit a go-ahead three-run homer in the fourth, connecting for the second game in a row. Scott Kazmir (2-1) allowed six hits and two runs in seven innings, struck out one and walked two.
