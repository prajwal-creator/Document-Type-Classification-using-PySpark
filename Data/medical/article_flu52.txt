ALTMAN JUNE 23, 2000     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           Shipments of influenza vaccine for this fall will be significantly delayed and there may be shortages because of manufacturing problems, federal officials said yesterday. In disclosing the surprising development, the officials told clinics, hospitals and other providers of health care to delay mass influenza immunization campaigns for at least a month later than planned and to make provisions to immunize people at highest risk first. Preparations are now under way for the immunizations, which are usually conducted  from October through mid-November. The delay was attributed in part to difficulty in growing in the laboratory two new influenza strains in this year's vaccine. Delays of up to one month in delivering influenza vaccine have occurred in earlier years, but Dr. Nancy Cox, chief of the influenza branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said, ''We have never had a situation where all manufacturers were having a similar problem with a strain.'' Also, the Food and Drug Administration has ordered two of the four manufacturers to correct other production problems at their plants. The problems were not specified.

It is not known exactly how many  Americans take the vaccine each year, but health officials estimated  that 70 million were immunized last year. An estimated 2 million to 4 million Americans 50 to 64 years old were expected to be new recipients of the vaccine this year. Because the influenza virus mutates, the vaccine is altered each year to account for the strains expected to circulate during the season. This year, as usual, the vaccine protects against three strains. The two new ones are A/Panama and A/New Caledonia; the third, B/Yamanashi,  was in last year's vaccine.

But experts at the federal agency and the centers for disease control, at a meeting in Atlanta, said it would take up to two months to determine how much vaccine would be available for this influenza season. Health officials said they and the manufacturers were confident that the supply would be sufficient to immunize those at highest risk of complications from influenza. They include individuals 65 and older, those suffering from diabetes and other chronic ailments of the heart, lungs and kidneys and people whose immune systems are suppressed because of cancer treatment or AIDS. The high-risk group also includes women more than three months pregnant during the influenza season, residents of chronic care facilities and people in close or frequent contact with high-risk groups. Because the peak of influenza seasons rarely occur before late December, vaccination campaigns conducted in November will come in time to allow recipients to develop immunity, a process that takes from one to two weeks. Studies have shown influenza vaccine to be 70 percent to 90 percent effective in preventing illness among healthy young men, and less effective among older people and those with chronic ailments. But the vaccine is effective in reducing influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths among older adults. The four manufacturers are: Evans Medical, an affiliate of Medeva Pharmaceuticals; Aventis-Pasteur; Parkedale Pharmaceuticals; and Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories Inc. The F.D.A. said that Parkedale was notified in March to cease production and distribution of influenza vaccine until it corrected problems the Federal agency had identified. Wyeth-Ayerst is the other manufacturer that the F.D.A. has cited for production problems.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
