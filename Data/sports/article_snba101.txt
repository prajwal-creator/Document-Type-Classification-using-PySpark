The meeting was the special convention of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which on Friday took a series of steps to clean up big-time intercollegiate athletics. The reluctant presence of so many chief executives was a sign that the fundamental agenda went beyond public scandals or fiscal control of big-time sports to the academic enterprise itself. ''This meeting was really about academic quality,'' said Edward Foote 2d, president of the University of Miami. ''If you have erosion in one part of the university, it spreads.'' Hoke Smith, the president of Towson State University in Maryland, agreed. ''If you are concerned with public education in this country,'' he said, ''you don't want its most visible symbol seen as corrupt.'' By near unanimous margins, delegates from 435 colleges and universities approved a sweeping set of reforms aimed at ending what John W. Ryan, president of Indiana University, called the ''integrity crisis'' in big-time intercollegiate athletics.

Coaches could carry any punishment they receive with them if they move on to another institution, and colleges and universities will be required to make audits not only of their athletic budgets but also of the academic status and progress of their athletes.

''The key to lasting reform is the president's office,'' said Mr. Foote of Miami. ''That's where the various interests of the university - academic, athletic, the budget and so forth - get balanced.'' The recent spate of scandals -most recently allegations of point shaving and possible drug dealing at Tulane University - has certainly been a factor, along with the fears that other embarrassments are possible, if not likely. One chief executive quoted an estimate by a ''reliable'' N.C.A.A. executive that there is cheating in 15 percent of major athletic programs. Scandals, though, are only one element. Major universities are being squeezed from numerous directions these days, from declining Federal support for student aid and scientific research to the growing competition for able students in the face of a declining number of high school graduates. As in other areas of American life, from the automobile showroom to the fashion industry, people are ascribing more importance to quality and excellence. For any college and university, this inevitably means academics. Significance of Decisions The actions of the special convention were seen as significant in several respects. First, they showed that the Presidents Commission, which originated as a compromise after a bid to give presidents veto power over convention decisions was beaten back, is now a force with which to be reckoned. ''We got about as many votes here as the Communist Party does in a Russian election,'' said Otis A. Singletary, president of the University of Kentucky and a leader within the commission. ''It shows that presidents can influence this organization if they decide to do so.''

''I don't know what the collective attention span of college presidents is,'' said Mr. Criser. ''We'll have to wait and see.'' Mr. Ryan, in an address to the business meeting, assured delegates that other proposals would be forthcoming as early as next January. ''This is only a beginning,'' he declared. Academic Standards for Athletes The most immediate unresolved issues involve academic standards for athletes. The regular convention next January must decide whether to stick with the new Proposition 48, scheduled to go into effect next year, stipulating that athletes must have attained cumulative scores of 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests and a 2.0 grade point average in high school in order to compete in their freshman year. Critics say this is unfair to some colleges, especially black ones, where many nonathletes do not meet these criteria. Many presidents would like to eliminate freshman eligibility across the board, a step that would eliminate the need for Rule 48 in the first place. Other unresolved issues involving academic standards include the low rate of graduation of athletes at many institutions. One possible approach is to restrict the number of new athletic scholarships a school can offer to freshmen when the percentage of senior athletes receiving diplomas falls below a certain level. Even further down the road are a host of issues relating to the effects of television revenues on the academic process. These include the increasing length of the season in sports such as baseball and the scheduling of playoff games.

Healy, president of Georgetown University, referring to the national basketball championship. ''Replacing Monday night football is not a compelling argument if it interferes with academics.'' Most of the presidents, athletic directors and others at the special convention were realistic about the complexity of these issues, but some offered reasons for optimism on pragmatic grounds. Mr. Smith of Towson State suggested that the new sections for recruiting violations could have a big effect on the level of cheating. ''You've got to remember the mentality your dealing with,'' he said. ''These people are used to playing until someone blows a whistle.'' Several delegates also suggested that the real agenda was to create the pressure on presidents, coaches and others that would allow them to act in ways in which they would prefer to act in the first place. ''Some presidents are vulnerable to forces outside and inside that are inimicable to the best interest of their institution,'' said Mr. Ryan. ''They want help. Whether we can help them is the question.''    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
