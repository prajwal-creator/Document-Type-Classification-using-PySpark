The judge, Jeffrey P. Minehart of Common Pleas Court here, granted motions for acquittal on the charges against the physician, Dr. Kermit Gosnell, who ran the Women’s Medical Center, a West Philadelphia abortion clinic. Judge Minehart also granted a motion for acquittal in five charges of abuse of corpse against Dr. Gosnell, who according to prosecutors killed fetuses that were alive after they were aborted by plunging scissors into their necks. Dr. Gosnell, 72, was also acquitted on one charge of infanticide. The judge gave no reason for his decision, which came on the fifth week of the trial and preceded the start of defense arguments, which had been scheduled to begin on Tuesday afternoon but are now expected to start Wednesday.

Before the judge announced his decision, an officer of the court instructed those present to remain silent.

Mr. Kemper, who traveled from Ohio to attend the trial, said he was convinced that Dr. Gosnell had deliberately killed live fetuses. “It makes no sense to me that he could snip the back of the neck of a baby that was not alive,” Mr. Kemper said during a break in the hearing. Dr. Gosnell still faces four charges of first-degree murder and one of third-degree murder in connection with the death of a patient at the Women’s Medical Center. If found guilty on the remaining charges, he could face the death penalty. Eight workers at Dr. Gosnell’s clinic have pleaded guilty in the case, including three to third-degree murder. Dr. Gosnell’s lawyer, Jack J. McMahon, argued that none of the seven fetuses his client is accused of killing were alive when they were removed from their mothers because they had been given a drug that killed them in utero. Therefore, there was no validity to the charges of murder, infanticide or abuse of corpse, he said.

Mr. McMahon dismissed prosecutors’ arguments that an arm movement by one of the fetuses, known as Baby C, indicated that it was alive. He said that the movement was “one spasm” but that the fetus was not breathing. Baby C had been one of the three fetuses for which the judge dismissed the murder charge. But on Wednesday morning the judge said the dismissal of the charge related to Baby C was done mistakenly, as a result of a “clerical error.” That charge was reinstated, and the charge related to Baby F was dismissed.

But Edward Cameron, an assistant district attorney, said that Baby C responded and “pulled back” when touched by medical staff. “That’s voluntary movement, and that’s all the law requires,” Mr. Cameron said. “That baby was alive.” Mr. Cameron also opposed the motion to acquit Dr. Gosnell on the abuse of corpse count, which stemmed from the jars of the severed feet of fetuses that were discovered in the clinic when it was raided by law enforcement officers in February 2011. Aborted fetuses should be treated as human beings, Mr. Cameron argued. “When you have got jars of feet that this man was keeping on the shelves of his office, that would offend anybody,” he said. “When the fetuses leave the mother, they are due the respect of any human being.” Mr. Cameron also highlighted the case of Baby D, which he said was 10 to 15 inches long and had a head “as big as a pancake.” It was moving when it was delivered into a toilet, Mr. Cameron said.
