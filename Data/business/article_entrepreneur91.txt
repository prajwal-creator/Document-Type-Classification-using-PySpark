Illustrated. 652 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $30. MY paternal grandmother endured many sadnesses when young and was understandably reticent when asked for details about her girlhood. But she made sure to pass on one vivid memory to her descendants: her banker father had briefly been in business with Buffalo Bill, and she had once been allowed to sit on the Great Man's buckskinned lap. My brother and sister and I were suitably awed when she first told us about it in the early 1950's. William F. Cody had been dead for more than 30 years then, but we all knew who he was -- or thought we did. Fact and fabrication were so tangled in the old showman's life that toward the end even he sometimes seemed to confuse the two, and writers and scholars have struggled to sort things out and to explain as well the extraordinary grip he maintained on the American imagination long after he was laid to rest on a Colorado mountaintop in 1917. Over the years, Henry Nash Smith, Don Russell, Richard Slotkin, Richard White, Joy S. Kasson, Larry McMurtry and many others have had their say. "Buffalo Bill's America," by Louis S. Warren, is well written and exhaustively researched, the weightiest and surely the most ambitious book ever published about Cody and his times. No one interested in Buffalo Bill, 19th-century show business or the many meanings of the American West will want to pass it up. But it is also likely to spark almost as many arguments as it seeks to settle.

Cody's claim to have ridden for the pony express as a boy -- still a staple of children's books about him -- is apparently false, for example. But the least plausible item in his catalog of gaudy deeds turns out to have been authentic: on today's border between Wyoming and Nebraska in 1876, within days of Custer's last stand, Cody really did help lead cavalrymen within sight of a small band of Cheyenne warriors and then, while "dressed in a stage costume of black velvet . . . trimmed with silver buttons," managed to kill and scalp a subchief.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       "The seam between truth and fiction, fake exploits and real deeds, was so artfully sewn as to be all but invisible," Warren writes of Cody's carefully constructed persona. "Audiences could pick and choose what they were willing to believe, and some were never convinced that Cody was everything he claimed to be. . . . 'He is a poseur,' wrote one reviewer, 'but he poses impeccably.' " He did indeed, and in the end, despite Warren's best efforts, he remains in many respects the dashing enigma he always was. Warren is less interested in nailing Cody's lies than in understanding why he told them. He seeks to situate his subject "in changing social and political contexts, to read the life as, in part, an expression of its era." To that end, he evokes each of the many worlds through which Bill Cody made his way en route to becoming Buffalo Bill. Tall and handsome and already costumed and coiffed as painstakingly as any eager ingénue, he was just 23 when he began collaborating in 1869 with the writer Ned Buntline, the first Easterner to see that there was big money to be made if the real Cody could be turned into the mythical embodiment of the West. By then, Cody had tried nearly every occupation open to a young Westerner on the make: courier, teamster, horse thief, Civil War soldier, would-be entrepreneur, gold seeker, buffalo hunter, Indian fighter, chief of scouts and more. As Warren skillfully shows, each provided him with authentic frontier experiences that he was able to embroider or rearrange (or appropriate wholesale from others) for inclusion in the personal legend he would tend tirelessly all his life. In 1872, he visited the East for the first time and saw at the Bowery Theater in New York an otherwise forgotten actor, gorgeously named J. B. Studley, playing a highly colored version of him. Later that year, in Chicago, Cody stepped into his own moccasins in a Buntline melodrama billed as "The Scouts of the Prairie or Red Deviltry as It Is" and was an instant hit with working-class audiences. He remained modest about his theatrical talents but justly proud of the power of his personality. "I'm not an actor," he told an interviewer. "I'm a star. All actors can become stars, but all stars cannot become actors." Nor did he care much about art. The blood-and-thunder plays in which he flourished for a decade were often "without head or tail," he admitted, but they always offered "noisy, rattling gunpowder entertainment, and . . . a succession of scenes of the late Indian war, all of which seemed to give general satisfaction."

It offered everything Western that wide-eyed Easterners hoped to see except the landscape: horses, elk and buffaloes; roping, riding and sharpshooting; simulated cyclones and prairie fires and gun battles and (for one season only) Sitting Bull himself. Buffalo Bill was always in the thick of it. Mounted on a handsome gray horse, he swept his big hat from his head to introduce his "Congress of Rough Riders of the World"; shot glass balls from the air; galloped to the rescue of a stagecoach and a settler's cabin surrounded by whooping Indians; and took center stage for a deeply affecting -- and entirely imaginary -- tableau in which he arrived only moments too late to save Custer and his command from annihilation. Warren explains how Cody and his collaborators, the shrewd showman Nate Salsbury and the brilliant publicist John Burke, figured out how to attract the middle-class family trade by packaging this crowded spectacle as a panorama of unbroken Western progress from wilderness to white settlement. " 'Buffalo Bill's Wild West' is not a show in the theatric sense of the term," the publicity said, "but an exposition of the progress of civilization." Cody could claim to edify and inspire as well as entertain. He gave Americans what they wanted to see, a fast-moving history of the West in which, as Richard White has written, "everything is inverted": Native Americans are the aggressors, their white conquerors the innocent, abused victims in need of rescue. Later, British and European audiences loved it, too. One by one, Warren examines each act of Cody's pageant in search of all it can tell us about his audience's complex and conflicting attitudes toward everything from race and masculinity to labor strife and overseas adventuring. But he sometimes labors too hard to find larger meanings in what was, for all its supposed educational value, a gussied-up circus, meant to delight small boys and girls while keeping their parents and grandparents amused as well. "Gosh!" Cody was once overheard to say as he looked through a sheaf of his own publicity. "The things they write!" I suspect he would have felt that way about some of Warren's delvings. It's hard to believe that the clumsy Virginia reel Cody's cowboys and cowgirls performed on horseback every afternoon was really meant to remind audiences of "the superiority of white people in the making of domestic space, in settling," as the author contends. It would certainly have startled Annie Oakley, Cody's "Little Sure Shot," to learn that her "image as a virtuous white girl, or a girl-bride, provided a regenerative female context for the show's exhibition of lethal weapons, her femininity a stunningly ironic paradox for a display of gun proficiency." Nor is it clear why the presence of Cossacks and gauchos, vaqueros and Arabs and African-Americans among Cody's Rough Riders "reinforced white supremacy as the culmination of world history, and thereby affirmed the subordination of immigrant ghettos, as well as the segregation of races, Jim Crow laws and the tidal wave of lynchings which swept the nation in the 1890's." Such overearnest, overreaching moments aside, however, "Buffalo Bill's America" is a provocative contribution to the long-running argument over just who Buffalo Bill was and what he and his frontier extravaganza can tell us about who we were -- and who we are. 'Buffalo Bill's America,' by Louis S. Warren Geoffrey C. Ward's books include "Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson."
