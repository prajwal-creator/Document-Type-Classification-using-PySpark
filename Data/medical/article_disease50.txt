Museums and Sites American Museum of Natural History: ‘Countdown to Zero’ (continuing) Smallpox is the only human disease to have been eradicated, but what about Guinea worm, polio, malaria and others? This exhibition, presented in collaboration with the Carter Center, examines international efforts to control and wipe out infection. Daily from 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., Central Park West and 79th Street, 212-769-5200, amnh.org. American Museum of Natural History: ‘The Secret World Inside You’ (continuing) In recent years, the microbiome — the roughly 100 trillion bacteria living inside and on human bodies — has been a popular talking point for science journalism. With ever-evolving research into this mysterious area of study, there’s still plenty left to explore. Now, it’s getting the exhibition treatment in this look at what scientists are learning about the role bacteria plays in health. Central Park West and 79th Street, 212-769-5200, amnh.org. Brooklyn Historical Society: ‘Brooklyn Americans: Hockey’s Forgotten Promise’ (through March 27) The New York Islanders may be new to Brooklyn, but the borough isn’t new to hockey. This exhibition tells the story of its first National Hockey League team, the Brooklyn Americans. The team wore red, white and blue jerseys and represented Kings County at the height of World War II and in the early days of the N.H.L. Still, as the exhibition shows, the team was unsuccessful and ultimately financially doomed. 128 Pierrepont Street, near Clinton Street, Brooklyn Heights, 718-222-4111, brooklynhistory.org. Center for Jewish History: ‘After the War: Recovery, Relief, and Return, 1945-1949’ (through Jan. 15) This exhibition commemorates the 70th anniversary of World War II’s end with a look at its bleak aftermath. Photographs from the International Center of Photography’s Roman Vishniac Archive, as well as artifacts from the American Jewish Historical Society and Leo Baeck Institute, tellhow the war led to mass destruction and displacement, and how Europe and the United States moved on toward revitalization. 15 West 16th Street, Flatiron district, 212-868-4444, cjh.org. ‘The Discovery of King Tut’ (Saturday through May 1) The king himself won’t make an appearance at this exhibition; the focus is the wealth of treasures from his tomb, along with the history of what happened when the British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered it in 1922. Replicas of the artifacts will be on display with explanations about how excavation and preservation work were carried out. Premier Exhibitions at 5th Avenue, 417 Fifth Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, Midtown South, 646-979-4120, tutnyc.com. ‘Global Citizen: The Architecture of Moshe Safdie’ (through Jan. 10) This touring exhibition, a retrospective of Mr. Safdie’s career of more than 50 years, makes its way to New York with new material based on the architect’s recent work related to dense urbanism in Asia. Donald Albrecht from the Museum of the City of New York organized the material in this show, which also explores Mr. Safdie’s design philosophy that buildings should be extensions of their physical, historical and cultural contexts. National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-369-4880, nationalacademy.org. Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum: ‘On the Line: Intrepid and the Vietnam War’ (continuing) Visitors familiar with this museum are likely well aware of its flight deck, perhaps even some of its wartime history.

Now, in an exhibition set in the space where the crew lived and worked, the museum tells their stories with artifacts, film clips and photographs.

Museum of Chinese in America: ‘Sub Urbanisms: Casino Urbanization, Chinatowns and the Contested American Landscape’ (through March 27) Stephen Fan, an architecture professor and curator, examines the trend of Chinese casino workers in Connecticut converting suburban homes into multifamily communities. This exhibition is both creative and historical; it takes the present to imagine the future of housing design while looking back on the events that created the trend of suburban migration. 215 Centre Street, between Howard and Grand Streets, Lower Manhattan, 212-619-4785, mocanyc.org. Museum of the City of New York: ‘The New York City Marathon: The Great Race’ (through March 8) At the beginning of the month, more than 50,000 runners made their way through all five boroughs of New York, starting on Staten Island and ending in Central Park. This annual race — a spectacle for anyone watching along the course — began modestly in 1970, with 127 people running laps around Central Park. City Museum’s timely exhibition tells the story of how the New York City Marathon became the world-class race it is today, including photos from amateurs and professionals on display. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, 212-534-1672, mcny.org. Museum of the Moving Image: ‘How Cats Took Over the Internet’ (through Jan. 31) Even people who hate cats can’t easily get through an hour of browsing online without coming across some kind of feline clickbait. This exhibition takes a critical look at and tells the story of how we, as a society, got to this point. Yes, there are cat GIFs. 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us; closed on Thanksgiving. National Museum of the American Indian: ‘Meryl McMaster: Second Self’ (through Dec. 11) Meryl McMaster, an artist from Canada and a Plains Cree member of the Siksika Nation, shows her “Second Self” photography series, which uses portraiture to explore the complex ways in which identity is constructed. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, 212-514-3700, nmai.si.edu; free. New York Hall of Science: ‘Gingerbread Lane’ (through Jan. 9) In recent years, the chef Jon Lovitch has worked every holiday season to break his own record for the world’s largest gingerbread village. He locked in Guinness World Records in 2013 and 2014. He’s back to do it again: 500 edible square feet with more than 1,050 houses and structures including a department store and a double-decker carousel. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, 718-699-0005, nysci.org; closed on Thanksgiving. New-York Historical Society: ‘Holiday Express: Toys and Trains From the Jerni Collection’ (through Feb. 28) Toys of yore are on view in a mountainous landscape for trains and scene-setting trinkets pegged to the holiday season. This massive display also incorporates theatrical lighting and soundscapes, including a multimedia installation designed to make it feel like the museum’s 77th Street entrance is in the midst of passing trains. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. New-York Historical Society: ‘Superheroes in Gotham’ (through Feb. 21) New York is safe as long as its long roster of comic-book heroes stick around. It’s been this way for nearly a century as these characters have defended the city in books, TV shows, movies, video games — even the Broadway stage. New-York Historical Society’s latest exhibition tells the story of how super heroes became a cultural staple for all ages and media. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. New York Public Library: ‘100 Years of the Picture Collection: From Abacus to Zoology’ (through May 15) The library celebrates the centennial of its Picture Collection with a sort of greatest-hits exhibition chosen from nearly 1.5 million images.

Subjects in the collection are organized alphabetically and number about 12,000. Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, 917-275-6975, nypl.org/locations/schwarzman; free; closed on Thanksgiving Day. New York Transit Museum: ‘Bringing Back the City’ (continuing) This new exhibition comes three years after Hurricane Sandy took a swipe at the city’s infrastructure. But what of the people who put the pieces back together? “Bringing Back the City” tells the stories of everyday services — like electricity and mass transit — that become extraordinary in times of crisis. Boerum Place, at Schermerhorn Street, Downtown Brooklyn, 718-694-1600, bringingbackthecity.com. Rubin Museum of Art: ‘Sacred Spaces’ (continuing) This exhibition’s premise is a question: What is a sacred space? It could be the museum’s Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room, an immersive look at a traditional space for prayer and meditation. Or it could be a panoramic vista among the Himalayas. It could even be a video installation about Jain devotional rituals. All are on view in this exploration of veneration and its venues. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org. ‘Sea Level: Five Boroughs at Water’s Edge’ (through Dec. 31) In its first pop-up exhibition for the Seaport Culture District, the American Institute of Architects presents a water’s eye view of the city through photos by Elizabeth Felicella and accompanying essays by Robert Sullivan. The panoramic view of New York starts at New York Harbor and makes its way along the East River, showing the shore of each borough along the way. Center @ the Seaport, 181 Front Street, South Street Seaport, Lower Manhattan, 212-683-0023, cfa.aiany.org. Trinity Wall Street: ‘Blood Mirror’ (through Dec. 1) After decades of banning gay and bisexual men from donating blood, the Food and Drug Administration updated its policy earlier this year to allow them to donate, but only after a year of celibacy, regardless of marital status. In response, the artist Jordan Eagles has gathered nine gay, bisexual and transgender men to donate a pint of blood each for this exhibit: a reflective, 7-foot-tall monolith that cases and preserves their blood in resin. Among the donors is the Rev. John Moody, who has been involved with Trinity for more than 40 years. Broadway at Wall Street, Lower Manhattan, 212-602-0800, trinitywallstreet.org/bloodmirror; free.

From 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, americanfinecraftshowbrooklyn.com. Goddard Riverside Book Fair (Saturday and Sunday) This annual fund-raiser doubles as a rare chance for book buyers to get new hardback best sellers at a 50 percent discount.

Credit Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade (Thursday) It’s time for Snoopy’s fall trek to Herald Square.

The festivities begin on Wednesday, when anyone can stop by the American Museum of Natural History from 3 to 10 p.m. to watch the balloons go from flat masses to pop culture favorites.

Spoken Word Louis Begley (Tuesday) Mr. Begley — the author, lawyer and member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters — discusses his latest novel, “Killer, Come Hither,” which was released in April.

Novak (Saturday) Mr. Novak, of “The Office” and “The Mindy Project,” entered the book-writing game last year with “One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories,” an eclectic collection of comedic short fiction. For his next trick, he has written a children’s book — but, as the title “The Book With No Pictures” suggests, with no art. The point is to read the book aloud, as Mr. Novak will, which makes for a silly experience when parents inevitably come across words like “glibbity globbity.” At 2 p.m., Strand Book Store, 828 Broadway, at 12th Street, 212-473-1452, strandbooks.com. Walking Tours Long Island City Tours: Queens Cool Uncovered (Sunday) The idea behind this tour is that Queens is due for more attention, starting with Long Island City.

Little Ireland, Chinatown and Little Italy History and Tasting Tour (Saturday) Think of this tour as an amuse-bouche for Thanksgiving, as well as a celebration of the cuisine brought to New York by immigrants who settled on the Lower East Side.

At 2 p.m. The meeting location is available upon making reservations, which can be arranged by calling NYC Discovery Walking Tours at 212-465-3331. Save the Village (Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday) Last year the Steven Kasher Gallery in Chelsea put on an exhibition with the photography of Fred W.

Now, the spirit of that show has taken the form of this walking tour, which includes stops at the places McDarrah captured on film: locales like Washington Square Park and the Stonewall Inn. At 10 a.m.; the tour meets at Christopher Park, Stonewall Place, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, savethevillagetours.com. A Taste of Jewish New York: Borough Park Tour (Sunday) Participants in this tour will get an insider’s look at the customs of the Hasidic residents of Borough Park, Brooklyn.
