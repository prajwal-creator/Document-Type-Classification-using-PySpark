What might not have been expected was that the rout in mining stocks would have begun in the spring, while prices for the raw materials were still climbing. Investment advisers credit that odd sequence of events to the caution  expressed by executives in the industry. They showed little inclination to persuade Wall Street analysts to raise their earnings estimates, and that sent a signal to take profits in a sector that had doubled and then doubled again over the preceding five years. The companies’ caution may have served as a catalyst for sellers, but after prices of metals and mining stocks hit such heights, even as global economic conditions appeared bleaker, they might not have needed much of an excuse to bail out.

Gerlach, manager of the Aberdeen Natural Resources fund. The slump in metals stocks “is consistent with a sense that we’re moving sideways, if not inching toward some sort of global slowdown.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Investors in another industrial commodity, coal, seem to have come to the same realization. Coal has suffered a steeper decline this month than the metals, after experiencing a bigger move on the way up, and shareholders in coal mining companies are paying the price, with drops of one-third or more of the stocks’ values. Michael Tian, who follows coal-mining shares for Morningstar, expects the decline in the commodity to be short lived. There just isn’t enough coal to go around, and producing more of it is problematic. “The coal supply picture looks quite constrained for quite a few years,” he said. “The coal exporting countries are all having problems” increasing supply, he added. Australia is finding it difficult to add infrastructure like rail and port capacity, and developing nations like Indonesia and Vietnam want to keep more of what they produce for their own use.

He does find a handful to be good values, including Massey Energy, Foundation Coal, Consolidated Energy and Peabody Energy. With investors having lost their appetite for industrial commodities for the moment, Mr. Gerlach says he is being cautious about metals stocks. He is especially wary of steel makers. Before buying them, “you had better have a firm opinion that global demand is going to stabilize,” he said. As for the other side of the equation, there are signs that production capacity is increasing, which could lead to higher supply. He considers iron ore mining companies better choices, especially BHP Billiton. “BHP is a core holding,” he said. “It’s the most diversified of miners. It will participate in the upside but is somewhat defensive.” ELSEWHERE on the periodic table, Mr. Gerlach’s selections include Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, as well as Century Aluminum, a small California business that derives a significant portion of its output from Iceland. That gives it access to cheap energy sources like geothermal power, which is important because aluminum production is highly energy intensive. Mr. Gerlach views the pullback in mining stocks as only temporary. He says indications that a recovery is imminent include evidence that softness in the Western economy is nearly over and that the building boom in China, where so much seems to be suspended as the Olympics draw near, is not. Although the decline in the sector may unsettle some investors who are unfamiliar with it, he says this is trading as usual. Commodity bull markets often have corrections of 15 percent or more every few months.
