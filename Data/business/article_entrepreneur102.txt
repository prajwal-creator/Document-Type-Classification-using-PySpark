HOLSON JULY 22, 2004     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           DreamWorks SKG, the studio behind the ''Shrek'' movies, announced on Wednesday that it planned to sell as much as $650 million in stock in its animation division, and will use the proceeds to increase its film production schedule and improve its competitive position with both the Walt Disney Company and Pixar Animation Studios. The share sale, expected to be the biggest initial public offering in the entertainment business since MGM went public seven years ago, should allow the DreamWorks founders -- Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg -- and the venture's original backers to recoup some of their $1.1 billion investment. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said DreamWorks Animation planned to use about $175 million for general corporate purposes, and use the remaining net proceeds to pay down some or all of the debt it intends to assume from DreamWorks SKG. The rest of DreamWorks will consist primarily of its live-action film studio, which recently released ''The Terminal'' and ''Anchorman.'' It is expected to continue as a private concern that could distribute and market the animation films.

But the big plans of 1994 have been drastically downsized. Its television operations have created few hits. The dot-com boom went bust. And a consolidating music industry, plagued by the rise of Internet file sharing, had little room for a start-up.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       In addition, the three founders have concentrated on their separate interests. While Mr. Katzenberg has been building DreamWorks Animation, which released the blockbuster ''Shrek 2'' in May, Mr. Spielberg has focused largely on making his own movies, not all for DreamWorks. And Mr. Geffen has been spending much of his time on personal pursuits, although he remains involved in the company's financial dealings. According to the filing, Mr. Katzenberg will be chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, which now has 1,100 employees who are based largely in Glendale, Calif. (Disney, by contrast, has about 600 animation workers.) He will have a salary of $1 a year, but will also receive stock in the form of options, bonuses or other grants worth about $20.5 million at the date of issue. The company will be controlled by Mr. Geffen and Mr. Katzenberg, largely through Class B shares that will give them and original investors majority ownership and supervoting rights. This, according to Wall Street analysts, should protect DreamWorks Animation from any potential takeover. Mr. Spielberg will not play a significant role in DreamWorks Animation, and he is not even named as a potential board member. Class A shares will be sold to the public, while DreamWorks' largest investor, Vulcan Capital, which is owned by the computer entrepreneur Paul G. Allen, will be the sole owner in a Class C share that allows Vulcan to elect one board member. ''To the degree that Paul Allen has a disproportionate investment, it is perfectly logical for him to want input,'' said Chris Dixon, a managing director at Gabelli Capital Partners.

Although the spinoff of the animation unit was expected, the timing was not. Analysts had anticipated the announcement in the fall or perhaps next year. But several analysts said yesterday they believed that the strength of ''Shrek 2,'' which is the highest-grossing film of the year after bringing in more than $425 million domestically and $300 million internationally since its release in May, pushed up the filing of the public offering. The offering is not without risks, according to analysts and the filing. DreamWorks Animation plans to release two animated films a year.

Unlike Pixar, DreamWorks Animation has had mixed success, with box-office disasters like ''Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas'' and overwhelming hits like ''Shrek'' and ''Shrek 2.'' In the filing, the studio acknowledged that it had ''limited experience'' in producing more than one movie a year and the task could put a ''significant strain on our resources.'' Mr. Dixon said investors would also focus on more short-term measures, including how well ''Shrek 2'' does with DVD sales and the success of its big fall offering, ''Shark Tale,'' the studio's next animated film, starring Will Smith. According to the filing, DreamWorks has made money in only two of the last five years, in 1999 when it earned $4 million and in 2001 when it earned $3.65 million. In the first quarter of this year, DreamWorks reported a net loss of $25.9 million on revenue of $40.8 million, compared with a net loss of $11.9 million on revenue of $48.2 million in the period last year. DreamWorks Animation had $465.3 million in debt, including $380.1 million allocated by DreamWorks SKG, at the end of the first quarter.
