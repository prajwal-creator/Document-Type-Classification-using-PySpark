Bob Watson, the team’s general manager, said he had been told that Hughes was “basically off limits.” Watson said that “a high-ranking official from the Yankees” told him that Hughes, a pitcher for Class AA Trenton, should not be considered for the national team. But Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman was miffed by Watson’s explanation and said that Watson had sought permission to include only Nick Green, a utility infielder who is playing in the major leagues, and J. B. Cox, a Class AA reliever, on the United States’ preliminary 60-man roster. “No one ever asked us about Phil Hughes,” Cashman said.  “There was nothing for us to say about him because no one asked us. They asked about one pitcher and it wasn’t Hughes.“   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   While Watson, who once had Cashman’s job, never inquired about Hughes, he laughed when he was asked if he thought the restriction that he cited came from George Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ principal owner.

Cashman stressed that he is making the baseball decisions for the Yankees while adding that Steinbrenner, who was a vice president of the United States Olympic Committee from 1989 to 1996 and was chairman of the U.S.O.C. Foundation from 1997 to 2002, would not have been involved in discussions about Hughes.

Cashman would not say how he would have reacted if Watson had asked about Hughes. But, in a way, he answered the question by noting that the Yankees have Hughes on an innings limit this season. Cashman has vowed not to include Hughes in possible trades for players like Alfonso Soriano and Bobby Abreu. The Yankees have been protective of Hughes, their prized prospect who turned 20 last month. Hughes, a right-hander with a 95-mile-an-hour fastball, has a 6-3 record and a 2.85 earned run average for Trenton. He has struck out 90 and walked 25 in 82 innings, after pitching 30 innings for Class A Tampa to begin the season. As Watson tries to assemble the most talented 24-man roster possible and make up for what he called the embarrassment of the United States baseball team’s not qualifying for the 2004 Olympics, he is dealing with some obstacles. He cannot simply pick the best players because they may not be available in another month. Since the 12-team tournament will be played from Aug. 26 to Sept. 6 in Cuba, it conflicts with the Sept. 1 date for expanding major league rosters to 40, from 25. The players Watson is considering for the United States team cannot be on 25-man rosters, but most of the players he would prefer are candidates to be promoted after rosters expand.

But if the Devil Rays trade shortstop Julio Lugo by Monday’s nonwaiver trade deadline, as they are expected to do, Upton will almost certainly be promoted to the majors and will no longer be a candidate for the team. Watson said Milledge’s situation would become clearer in a few weeks. “If Lastings Milledge is not in the big leagues on Aug. 16, we have a good chance to get him,” Watson said. “If he’s in the big leagues, there’s no chance.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The former major league manager Davey Johnson is the United States manager. Watson has spoken to the general mangers of all 30 major league teams and told them that the players who commit to playing would stay with the United States team for the duration of the tournament, a prospect that could be dicey for teams. For instance, if a player was picked and his team later had some injuries and wanted him to leave Cuba, Watson said that would not be possible. “There are no flights leaving Cuba on Sept. 1,” Watson said. There are two six-team groups in qualifying, and the winner of each will advance to Beijing. The United States is in a group with Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Canada, Brazil and Aruba. The other group consists of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama, Nicaragua and Colombia. The third- and fourth-place teams will have another chance at qualifying for a chance to win what will be the final Olympic baseball gold medal during a supplemental tournament next year. After 2008, baseball will be eliminated as an Olympic sport.
