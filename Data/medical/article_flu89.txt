Winter means flu, and flu encourages sufferers to give their colds to Contac, or Dristan, or NyQuil, or Comtrex, along with other pills, tablets and liquids in the $1.3 billion business. ''This market is very dependent on the level of winter nastiness,'' said Neil B. Sweig, an analyst a t Shearson/Am erican Express. ''Last February-March, we had widespread flu, and co ld remedy sales in that period were up 21 percent. Now we are having a much co lder December-January this year than we had last year, and that bodes wellfor this market.'' But, while cold remedies as a group have been outselling items such as shampoo, toothpaste and aspirin individually for several years, the industry has had trouble growing.

The bulk of the market - $785 million - is made up of cold remedies. There, unit sales have been growing only 3 percent a year, according to Mr. Sweig. And while analysts estimate an 18 percent across-the-board sales increase in 1981 over 1980, they also say that it reflects mostly price increases, rather than greater volume. ''It's a marketing game,'' said Peter B. Robb, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. ''New improved products, or product line extensions supported by heavy advertising, are the ones that make the most headway.'' New-Product Scramble In the scramble for market share, manufacturers have recently introduced a number of new products -Richardson-Vicks's Headway, for example - but none have enjoyed the spectacular success of Comtrex. Comtrex, a Bristol-Myers Company product, arrived on retail shelves in the last quarter of 1978 and propelled itself into third place almost immediately, capturing a 13 percent to 15 percent dollar share of the market.

According to Mr. Robb, the company has a market share of slightly more than 25 percent of the cold remedy market. Close on its heels is Contac, marketed by Menley & James, the SmithKline subsidiary, with about a 16 percent to 18 percent market share, according to Mr. Robb. Comtrex ranks third and No.4 is Dristan, from the American Home Products Corporation, which has roughly 10 percent to 12 percent and about $74 million in 1981 sales, according to Mr. Sweig. The remaining third of the cold remedy market seems to be divided between brands such as CoTylenol, from the McNeil Consumer Products division of Johnson & Johnson, and Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold Medicine from Miles Laboratories, as well as private-label brands from major drugstore chains.

''Comtrex looked at an untapped market and found people who wanted to take one pill that would clear up their noses and throats and sinuses all at once,'' said Mr. Sweig, at Shearson/American Express. Comtrex was introduced with a network television ad campaign that showed a medicine cabinet spilling over with pills and bottles on one side, and a lone container of Comtrex on the other. The ads worked.  Comtrex drew sales of $30 million in 1980, and more than $60 million in 1981. Then others quickly picked up on the multisymptom approach. In comparison, Contac, with its time-release capsules, staked out its territory in 1961 and has owned it ever since.  ''There are no significant competitors to Contac in the sustainedrelease field,'' said William P. Howe 3d, vice president and director of marketing for Menley & James. Aspirin users are not the direct marketing target of major cold remedy brands, because the use of aspirin is not limited to fighting colds. It remains to be seen whether the new entries will open up more of the market, or simply steal market share from their predecessors.  ''There's an increasing trend toward self-medication, as doctors's fees and prescription drug prices have risen enormously over the past 10 years,'' said a spokesman at Richardson-Vicks, citing a 141 percent rise in prescription drug prices over the past ten years.  ''New entries create additional competition, but they help expand the market.''    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
