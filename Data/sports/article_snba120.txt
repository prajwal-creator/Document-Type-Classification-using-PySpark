(Ballantine, $2.95.) Professor Winesap visits old Professor Agaard in his Charles Addams-ish house and during the night hears the story that the professor's giant son has written. That mythical tale is about the conflict between good and evil in a fabulous 16th-century Scandinavian kingdom. An entertaining novel within a novel, and a challenging exercise in literary game playing. NUMBER 1, by Billy Martin and Peter Golenbock. (Dell, $3.25.) GUIDRY, by Ron Guidry and Peter Golenbock. (Avon, $2.50.) The lives and views of two of baseball's most colorful characters. ''Number 1'' is, of course, Billy Martin, feisty former manager of the New York Yankees, now of the Oakland Athletics. ''Guidry'' is Ron Guidry, the down-home Cajun boy who made it the hard way to stardom as a Yankee pitcher. Both stories have been skillfully set down in first-person, as-told-to style by Peter Golenbock. SCARLET NIGHT, by Dorothy Salisbury Davis. (Avon, $2.25.) Julie Hayes, a somewhat wacky young lady who turns sleuth on occasion, moves to Manhattan's SoHo, buys a painting and, before she knows it, is deeply involved in an international art thievery caper. The characters are convincing; the writing deft. DINGLEY FALLS, by Michael Malone. (Pocket, $3.50.) Heart trouble, both real and symbolic, is rampant among the homey, colorful residents of Dingley Falls, a western Connecticut town, bent on preserving its ''true America'' spirit as it celebrates its 300th anniversary. Witty and vividly narrated fiction.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A MARRIED MAN, by Piers Paul Read. (Avon, $2.95.) At age 40, a successful London barrister, bored by his career and 12-year marriage, runs for Parliament with the aid and encouragement of a woman. Then his wife is found brutally murdered. This cool, ironical picture of Britain in the uneasy 1970's confirms its author's reputation as one of that country's most intelligent, disturbing writers.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       VIDA, by Marge Piercy. (Fawcett/Crest, $2.95.) The vicissitudes of the antiwar movement of the 1960's and 70's as seen through the perceptions and relationships of Vida, a young underground activist sought for her part in a bombing. A provocative novel that captures the look and spirit of a shattering time. HEARTSOUNDS, by Martha Weinman Lear. (Pocket, $3.50.) An account, by his widow, of the four years during which Harold Lear, M.D.  suffered from a finally fatal cardiac disease, an experience that gave them both a disenchanted view of the way medicine is currently practiced in hospitals and a closer relationship as husband and wife. An awesome, gripping book that is as much about loving as it is about dying. THE SCORPION SIGNAL, by Adam Hall. (Playboy, $2.95.) Quiller, a English secret agent, is sent to Russia on a highly dangerous mission - to rescue or exterminate a fellow operative who knows too much about British cells in the Soviet Union. An exciting thriller, filled with tension and a brooding sense of what it's like to cope with the K.G.B.

A miscellany of stories, reportage, a few autobiographical snippets and an extended true-crime narrative presented in an idiosyncratically Capotesque style. In some of the pieces the various elements seem to be at war with themselves; in some the humor outweighs the toplofty style. At their best, they're entertaining slapstick and gossip. ABERRATION OF STARLIGHT, by Gilbert Sorrentino. (Penguin, $3.95.) The plot is a tacky love story in which everyone's motives are tainted, the dialect that of New Jersey during the Great Depression, the style is Late Eclectic Modern, borrowed from Flaubert, Joyce and Beckett. The result: an entertaining, peppery little novel. HAWK OF MAY, by Gillian Bradshaw. (NAL/Signet, $2.75.) Gwalchmai, nephew of King Arthur, is an inept and persecuted teen-ager in his native land, but when he's transported into a visionary Otherworld he proves himself very much a hero, fending off demons and facing down sorcerers. This lyrical fantasy novel, the first in a projected trilogy, marks the debut of a writer of uncommon talent. LOOKING FOR RACHEL WALLACE, by Robert B. Parker. (Dell, $2.50.) In this sixth novel about Spenser, the big, tough, heart-of-gold Boston private eye is hired to protect a touchy, feminist lesbian author.  Sparks fly, she gets rid of him and then she gets kidnapped. He sets out to get her back. The dialogue is crackling, the action plentiful. THE QUARTZSITE TRIP, by William Hogan. (Avon, $2.95.) Under the leadership of a superb teacher, a motley band of seniors at Los Angeles's John Muir High School spend the spring break on a camping trip in the stark boondocks. A wildly funny, bawdy, nostalgic remembrance of things past in that last complacent time, the early 1960's. FORGOTTEN IMPULSES, by Todd Walton. (NAL/ Signet, $2.75.) Muskie's return from the faculty wars at the University of Chicago to his family home in a small downstate town occasions the excavation of amatory artifacts hidden beneath the seemingly uninteresting Midwest plain. Todd Walton's ear-perfect rendering of native voices and spare, piercingly real eroticism makes his narrative quite appealing.    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
