President Obama meets today with business leaders to build support ahead of what could be the toughest fight of his final year in office: gaining congressional approval of the pact the U.S. reached with 11 other Pacific Rim nations. The deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which would create an economic bloc to challenge China, came as a relief to allies in Asia , but U.S. opponents see it as a giveaway to business. • Data-sharing is ruled invalid. American companies, particularly technology giants like Google and Facebook, may have to stop using online personal data from Europeans in the U.S. after a ruling by Europe’s highest court today.

McDonald of Canada today won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery of neutrino oscillations. The oscillations show that neutrinos — a kind of subatomic particle — have mass, a discovery that raised understanding of matter and the universe. • Testimony on hospital airstrike. Gen. John F. Campbell, the American commander in Afghanistan, testified to lawmakers today that a Doctors Without Borders hospital was struck “mistakenly” and that the attack was “a U.S. decision made within the U.S. chain of command.” The nonprofit medical group has said the Kunduz attack, which killed 19 people on Saturday, may amount to a war crime. Previously, the military said the strike was a response to an Afghan request. • The reality of fantasy sports. Two leading companies in the fantasy sports field are defending themselves after what amounts to accusations of insider trading , with the disclosure that employees won big jackpots. Fantasy sports is the online and unregulated business in which players assemble fantasy teams with real athletes and pay entry fees to compete with others. Critics say the business is little different from Las Vegas-style gambling that is normally banned in the sports world.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   • On Capitol Hill. The Senate will consider a military spending bill today. The White House says it will veto the current version because it allows spending beyond the levels mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act , without allowing the same spending limits to be lifted on nonmilitary expenses. And Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, says that Representative Kevin McCarthy of California would fall short of the votes needed to become House speaker. Mr. Chaffetz also wants the job . • Behind the killings in Oregon. We’re learning more about the gunman through online postings his mother made over a decade. She’s a licensed practical nurse who kept guns at home and expressed pride in her son’s expertise in weapons.

MARKETS • Ben S. Bernanke acknowledges in his new memoir that he may have misled the public about whether the U.S. government could have saved Lehman Brothers from collapse in 2008 . He and Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary, believed at the time that acknowledging their inability to save Lehman would have hurt market confidence, he writes. The Federal Reserve under Mr. Bernanke is widely credited with arresting the 2008 crisis in time to stop a collapse of the nation’s financial system. • Wall Street  stock s are looking for direction after Monday’s big rally. European indexes are higher, and Asian shares ended mixed.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   NOTEWORTHY • Take a break from the screen? Sherry Turkle, a clinical psychologist and tech expert, asks us to reconsider our bond to digital devices and to have more personal interactions, in the book “ Reclaiming Conversation ,” released today. And Geraldine Brooks, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, returns with “ The Secret Chord ,” which reimagines King David’s biblical world. • On the scene. This week, The Times is celebrating its milestone of passing the mark of one million digital-only subscribers. Today, we look at the more than 150 countries and territories our correspondents have taken us to over the last year. • Be patient, “X-Files” fans. The reboot of “The X-Files” TV show, starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as the agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, has its world premiere today in Cannes, France. The U.S. premiere is Saturday at New York Comic Con, but it won’t appear on Fox until Jan. 24. Tonight Bill Clinton appears on “The Late Show” (11:35 p.m. Eastern, CBS). And here’s the episode recap of “Blindspot.” • Onstage. Clive Owen and Kelly Reilly make their Broadway debuts today in a revival of the Harold Pinter play “ Old Times ,” about a married couple visited by an old friend of the wife’s and the power struggle that ensues. And previews begin today of “ Allegiance ,” a musical inspired by the story of the actor George Takei (who also stars) and about Japanese-Americans forced into internment camps after Pearl Harbor. • Never too late for breakfast. Today, McDonald’s extends breakfast to be served all day at its U.S. locations, but not all options will be available.

It’s because of more commercials and more strategy sessions on the pitcher’s mound. So there’s more time for gimmicks like the “kiss cam,” the stadium camera that pans the ballpark looking for couples to project on a big screen as the crowd roars its encouragement for them to kiss.  Photo        Kiss cam images projected in Times Square in New York.   Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times    The kiss cam got its start in the early 1980s, as ballparks installed giant video screens and wanted to use them during breaks in the action. Being caught on a kiss cam can be fraught with peril, because you might be sitting with a colleague, a relative, a friend or even a stranger. Still, use of the kiss cam has spread, including to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. And there’s even a promotional kiss-cam screen in Times Square. It’s not all lovey-dovey. The gimmick has been criticized for making a joke out of “forcing” two men to kiss , and last month Syracuse University ended the kiss cam after a male fan complained that it encourages sexual assault. Sometimes, though, a kiss-cam kiss is just a kiss . (Correction: In Monday’s Morning Briefing , we omitted the Falcons from the list of unbeaten N.F.L. teams. Sorry, Atlanta.)
