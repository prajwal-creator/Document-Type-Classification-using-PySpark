''No big deal,'' recalled Mr. Paterson, a 19-year-old University of Colorado freshman. ''It wasn't like I was dying,'' he said. By the time the plane landed four hours later, he had an entirely different perspective. ''It feels like my head is going to explode,'' he remembers telling his mother from a phone at baggage claim. Mr. Paterson was certainly not dying, but because his sinuses were clogged and unable to decompress as the plane descended, the pressure in his skull made him feel as if he were. By the time he returned to Denver three days later, the fluid in his sinuses had become infected, leaving him in considerable pain. His doctor prescribed antibiotics, then prednisone, an oral steroid, to reduce swelling. ''Getting on a plane definitely made a bad cold worse,'' said his doctor, Lonny Granston, of University Family Medicine in Boulder, Colo. While certain conditions preclude flying, dozens of others -- like Mr. Paterson's cold -- are harder to gauge. Those who suspect that air travel may be imprudent should consult their doctor before flying. Some illnesses become more painful in the air, others can worsen and lead to serious physical damage, and still others are completely unaffected. In-flight pressure changes can create significant discomfort in a host of conditions. Sinusitis, pneumonia, other serious respiratory illnesses, active and intense allergies and ear infections are all good reasons not to fly, as cavities filled with fluid expand and put pressure on the brain, according Dr. Russell B. Rayman, executive director of the Aerospace Medical Association in Alexandria, Va. (The organization's Web site, at www.asma.org, offers some helpful publications, including ''Useful Tips for Travel.'')

Rensimer, director of the International Medicine Center in Houston, a practice that specializes in travel health. (Advice can be found on his Web site, which is at www.traveldoc.com.) Those who have suffered a concussion or undergone a colonoscopy should wait a day before flying. Women with high-risk pregnancies should not fly, nor should women who are past their due date.

Cast or no cast, keeping hydrated, walking the cabin, and not crossing legs is recommended to stave off blood clots and swelling. These tactics can help to prevent deep vein thrombosis -- so-called economy-class syndrome -- or blood clots that can be fatal. Flying, especially long haul, is not recommended for other conditions because of the amount of time a passenger will be without medical attention, said Dr. Herbert L. DuPont, medical director of the travel medicine department at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston and the author of the ''Textbook of Travel Medicine and Health.'' He warns anyone with severe abdominal cramps that are confined to one area to seek medical attention before traveling, particularly if the pain is accompanied by fever, chills or blood in the stool. ''Within a few hours an infected appendix or gall bladder can rupture,'' he said. Migraine sufferers can usually evaluate for themselves whether they're fit for travel, but Dr. DuPont recommends that anyone experiencing a headache accompanied by blurred vision should see a doctor before departure, as this can be evidence of a coming aneurysm or stroke.

These boxes include medications for the particular illness plus emergency tools like injectable steroids and epinephrine for severe asthmatics and those with potentially lethal allergies. Since Sept. 11, all syringes must be accompanied by a professionally printed prescription label or a doctor's note. A 'Destination' Doctor It's not a bad idea for chronic disease sufferers and those who have recently been ill to locate a doctor at the travel destination, especially if the planned stay is long. Patients find this not only comforting, Dr. Rensimer said, but also invaluable in case of a flare-up. Some doctors recommend packing double the medication in case of changed plans or travel delays, and all stress that medications should be packed in a carry-on, since checked bags can be lost. Anyone with a serious communicable illness should not fly, Dr. Rayman said. This includes active tuberculosis, meningitis, malaria and hepatitis, among others. In each case the prospective passenger should get a doctor's confirmation that the illness is out of its contagious phase before planning a trip. Children with active chicken pox should also not fly, because the virus, if contracted by an adult or someone with a compromised immune system, can be fatal, Dr. Rayman said. Doctors caution against taking infants with diarrhea on board, as frequent diaper changing and thus spreading of germs is necessary and dehydration of the infant likely. Those with less dangerous but equally contagious conditions like cold or flu should be considerate if they do fly. ''I recommend limiting your circulation in the plane -- in other words, staying in your seat unless you need to use the lavatory,'' said Dr. DuPont, who also suggests thorough hand washing and no hand shaking or cheek kissing, along with the obvious: covering the nose and mouth during coughing and sneezing. Passengers sitting within four to six feet of the infected person are most at risk of contracting the illness, said Dr. Rensimer, though he added that catching a virus is no more likely in a plane than in a restaurant with closely packed tables. Dr. Rensimer has established a routine of ''clearing'' even his seemingly healthy patients before long flights, particularly those who fly frequently for business or are over 50. He gives them stress tests on a treadmill, looks at risk factors like obesity, smoking and a family history of heart disease or high blood pressure, and screens them for conditions that could be aggravated by flying. Dr. Rensimer also urges his patients with untreated conditions like gall bladder disease or hernias to have them taken care of before leaving home. ''You just don't want  to find yourself in a fix six miles up,'' he said.   HOPE REEVES writes frequently for The Times.
