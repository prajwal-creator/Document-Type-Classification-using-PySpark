Credit Kiko Huesca/European Pressphoto Agency By  The Associated Press May 13, 2017 Rafael Nadal withstood a challenge from David Goffin, 7-6 (3), 6-2, to reach the Madrid Open semifinals. In a meeting between the players with the most match wins this year, Nadal saved all five break points he faced to win his 13th straight match. Goffin, who has 27 victories, was trying to make it to his third final this season.

On the women’s side, the defending champion Simona Halep cruised past Anastasija Sevastova, 6-2, 6-3, to reach the final, where she will face Kristina Mladenovic.
