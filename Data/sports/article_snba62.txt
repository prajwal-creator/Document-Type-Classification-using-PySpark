Each time a player reaches a milestone -- and there have been plenty in Monahan's 30 years with the team -- he collects the ball, uses an indelible pen to mark the occasion and places it in a glass case. ''We average a couple a week,'' Monahan said. The frequency increased when Roger Clemens joined the Yankees two years ago. And after the Yankees' 3-1 victory over the Athletics yesterday, completing a three-game sweep, Monahan had another baseball on which to scribble some history. On the 15th anniversary of his first 20-strikeout game, Clemens struck out five and moved into sixth place on the major league career strikeout list. Monahan said he would write this: ''3,535 strikeouts, going ahead of Gaylord Perry, against Oakland's Jeremy Giambi, Apr. 29, 2001, at Yankee Stadium.'' ''As we climb this ladder, it'll probably go right next to the Walter Johnson one,'' said Clemens, who passed Johnson on opening day for most career strikeouts in the American League. ''These are pretty big-time names, guys that have had longevity. It's pretty neat to have your name mentioned with these guys.''

Paul O'Neill injected the only other sour note. He was ejected for throwing his bat and helmet after he was called out on a checked swing.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       But it was a satisfying conclusion to the Yankees' weekend. Alfonso Soriano got his first walk -- ''Soriano walked?'' O'Neill said, smiling -- and the Yankees completed a mini-turnaround against the A's, last year's West Division champions, now 12 games behind Seattle. Clemens looks so trim in photos from his first 20-strikeout game, in 1986 -- he repeated the feat 10 years later -- that he can be mistaken for a college pitcher. The past few days, he had been reminded of the anniversary, and it was obvious that he cared deeply about his place in history. In the seventh, he struck out Miguel Tejada to lead off the inning. Then, after Giambi looked at a third-strike slider, the Yankees tossed the ball around the infield. Clemens followed the ball's trajectory intently, as if he were a fan at a tennis match. He finally retrieved it and tossed it to catcher Jorge Posada, who gave it to a batboy to pass to Monahan. Clemens kept both strikeout mementos, the balls he used to strike out Tejada and Giambi, and said he would most likely give one to Posada, as he did after his 15-strikeout, 1-hit shutout in last year's American League Championship Series. Posada gave that one back. ''I don't want any,'' Posada said yesterday. ''I just hope when he gets to the Hall of Fame, I get invited. I want to be in the stands.'' O'Neill joked that the Yankees' string of milestones had more to do with the players' ages. He recalled facing Clemens as a hitter.

''Dominant pitchers don't just get you out, they kind of embarrass you, too, because they just blow you away.'' Clemens (3-0) allowed four hits in seven and a third innings but was not overpowering. He retired seven of his final eight batters after allowing Oakland's only run in the sixth inning.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Clemens is more than just a relic clinging to glory. At 38, he is a No. 1 pitcher again. Yesterday, he provided the Yankees with stability to end what was a shaky homestand. On Friday, the Yankees were coming off a three-game sweep by Seattle. During the team's pitching meeting before the A's series, Manager Joe Torre reminded his starters that they did not need to overdo it to get results. ''We're hard enough on ourselves, but Joe got on us a little bit about trying to do too much,'' Clemens said. ''When we had a miscue or something, we tried maybe too much to get that fourth out. I feel I'm capable of doing that. I think I can get four outs, maybe about five, and I still feel I have good enough stuff to pick the guys up. About the most disturbing thing is when you don't.'' Clemens's philosophy was tested in the second inning, when a fly ball to the warning track in right field went off the webbing of O'Neill's glove for an error. Tejada's infield single put runners on the corners, but Giambi popped out. In the third inning, Soriano took a full-count pitch from the Oakland starter Barry Zito for ball four, earning his first walk in his 104th plate appearance of the season, prompting the organist Eddie Layton to play ''Hallelujah.'' It was baseball's longest streak without a walk to open a season in six years. Soriano, who said he was happy but not relieved, stole second and later scored on Derek Jeter's single for a 1-0 lead. The Yankees added two runs in the fourth. Tino Martinez was hit by a pitch, Posada reached on an error, Michael Coleman drove in a run on a groundout and Soriano singled in another. ''This is more what we're capable of doing,'' Torre said. ''I like the little baseball we played, scoring those two runs without a lot going on.'' INSIDE PITCH PAUL O'NEILL was not pleased with the fifth-inning strikeout call by Umpire C. B. BUCKNOR or with his subsequent ejection by Bucknor after O'Neill threw his helmet and bat while walking away. ''My back was to him,'' said O'Neill, who added that Bucknor should have appealed to the third-base umpire when he tried checking his swing. ''I don't want to be in a gunfight with him. He waited until I turned my back. I thought we were past this stuff.''. . . The Yankees are scheduled to visit the White House on Friday during a four-game series with the Orioles in Baltimore. . . . DAVID JUSTICE (9 for 59 in his previous 15 games) sat against a left-handed starter for the second time in five games. Justice replaced O'Neill in right field and flied out in his only at-bat.
