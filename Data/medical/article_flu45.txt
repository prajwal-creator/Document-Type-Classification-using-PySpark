Backs Flu Vaccine Given by Mist, Not a Needle   By ANDREW POLLACK JUNE 18, 2003     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           A flu vaccine that is squirted up the nose rather than injected into an arm was approved by the Food and Drug Administration yesterday, providing a new option for some people who dislike needles. But as expected, the vaccine, known as FluMist, was approved only for healthy people 5 to 49, a group that now rarely gets flu vaccines. So MedImmune Inc. and Wyeth, the developers of the vaccine, said they would spend $50 million in the coming flu season on advertising and marketing, stressing the burden of missed days of school and work. ''It's about changing the view of flu in this target population,'' said Armando Anido, senior vice president for sales and marketing at MedImmune, a biotechnology company in Gaithersburg, Md. ''I think that there has not been really a whole lot of discussion about the burden of flu on that healthy population.'' The vaccine will cost $46 a dose wholesale -- and probably $50 to $65 for consumers -- two to six times the cost of a flu shot.

Those people will have to continue receiving flu shots.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Still, some experts said, the use of FluMist by healthy people could free up shots for the elderly, alleviating shortages that arise in some years. The new vaccine ''will potentially increase the availability'' of the conventional flu shot ''for those people at highest risk,'' the F.D.A. commissioner, Mark B. McClellan, said in a statement. Influenza kills an estimated 36,000 Americans a year, many of them elderly. But flu is often spread by children, and studies in Japan have shown that inoculating children can reduce the rate of death in the elderly. Dr. Pedro Piedra, associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine, said the absence of a needle would encourage children to be vaccinated, which he said was important, even though children rarely die from flu. ''All you have to do is be in a pediatric office in the wintertime and see the impact a number of respiratory viruses have on children,'' he said. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which develops the government vaccination recommendations, will meet today to discuss FluMist. While flu shots are not recommended for healthy people below age 50 they are not discouraged either and the committee might adopt similar language for FluMist.

It provokes the immune system but does not cause serious disease. Still, as a live vaccine it could theoretically give a mild case of flu to a person who takes it, particularly someone with a weakened immune system. That is one reason it is not recommended for young children, older adults and those with health problems. The conventional flu shots are made from killed viruses. Wall Street analysts differ on the potential of FluMist, with some agreeing with MedImmune that it could reach $1 billion in annual sales and others thinking that merely eliminating the needle will not prompt many healthy people to be vaccinated.

He said the skepticism, which he did not share, stemmed from the fact that FluMist was more a consumer product than the typical biotechnology advance aimed at an unmet medical need. ''Demand for this product will be driven by advertising, and biotech has never seen this before,'' he said. The basic technology of FluMist was developed starting in the 1960's by Hunein F. Maassab at the University of Michigan. But there was little commercial interest in the vaccine until the 1990's, when it was licensed by Aviron, a biotechnology company later acquired by MedImmune. ''I feel in a sense that I have accomplished my life's dream,'' Dr. Maassab, now retired and ill, said yesterday in a statement issued by the university. ''I spent all my lifetime developing this vaccine.''  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
