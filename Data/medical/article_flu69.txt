"Dynamite player; that's a given," said John Paxson, guard. "Playing with a sense of freedom," said B. J. Armstrong, reserve point guard. "Looks much stronger," said Jerry Krause, general manager. "He can embarrass you," said Michael Jordan, superstar. No one, least of all Nets Coach Chuck Daly, was ready to vote the second-year point guard to the Hall of Fame, the All-Star Game or even into the Nets' starting lineup. Maybe the Bulls were just projecting. Especially Paxson, who tried to guard Anderson in the first quarter of the Bulls' 99-94 preseason victory over the Nets on Tuesday night in Syracuse. Tell the Truth   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Well, Paxson really couldn't, which is why Jordan stepped out near the top of the key for the Nets' last possession of the quarter, after Anderson had torched Paxson for 9 points and three assists, penetrating the lane as he saw fit.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       "I got caught in a switch with John," Jordan said, an untruth to camouflage his obvious pursuit of a spontaneous challenge. Jordan just wanted to lay some Dream Team defense on the slender but slippery kid from the playgrounds of New York, which he did, causing Anderson to slip and the Nets to commit a 24-second violation. Still, when Michael Jordan calls you out, that's respect. The Strut Returns Paxson cared to comment on what he observed last season, when Anderson was the $3 million-a-year rookie who dared to miss the training camp of the Nets' former coach, Bill Fitch. Anderson spent an unhappy winter, his minutes dwindling in sharp contrast to the Nets' rise to the playoffs. "Fitch was one of those guys who's not going to let a guy like that step right in," Paxson said. "Last year, Kenny looked a little disinterested, probably for good reason. "But a coach can make a big difference. In Chuck's system, the point guard gets a lot of chances, screens and rolls, the kinds of things Isiah Thomas has been doing for years. The strut Kenny had in college, that's back. It looks like Chuck has just said, 'It's your ball.'

No championship is going to be won with a point guard who is not a great passer and who shoots, as Blaylock did last season, at best, 43 percent. Even those who watch the game through the eyes of a casual fan can plainly see that Anderson has the "vision thing." On one penetration Tuesday night, he made a perfect pass -- behind him -- to Chris Morris in the lane for a layup. He's No Blaylock "Kenny's been great," Daly said. "I think we're seeing that he is what they said he was going to be." Whatever Anderson is, he is no Blaylock -- not even close -- on defense. So Daly, a defensive coach, must really enjoy the sight of the ball in Anderson's creative hands.

A bout with the flu set him back and a battle with the Nets over an unfulfilled promise of a contract renegotiation brought him down. Since Daly hasn't stopped talking about what a great player Anderson is going to be, Blaylock may want to get used to the idea of third guard. There are worse fates, Sacramento for one. No one, most of all Anderson, would want to admit it, but Fitch very likely did him a favor. His teammates, in the process of establishing themselves as playoff competitive, were no more tolerant of his rookie mistakes, much less his belief that he deserved major minutes, than Fitch. If Anderson is about to inherit the offense, he is getting a better team. And having struggled, he is probably a better man. "I've known him since high school, and last year wasn't him," Armstrong said. "When I saw him this summer, he said, 'I've had a productive summer.' Anytime the coach gives you the ball and some encouragement, you get a sense of freedom. That's how it looks."    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
