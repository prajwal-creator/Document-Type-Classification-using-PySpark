The vaccine would combine the current diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus shot with a flu immunization and a vaccine, which SmithKline already makes, against hepatitis B. Analysts said the deals would push SmithKline into the front line of the $1.5 billion world vaccine market. "The growing emphasis on preventive medicine, for both health and economic reasons, is giving vaccines an increasingly important role," said Jan Leschly, chairman of SmithKline's pharmaceuticals unit.

The agreement must be approved by the boards of the two companies.

SmithKline will sell the Michigan vaccines, including a rabies shot, in the 49 other states.

"A lot of companies are working on developing mega-vaccine combinations," said Rita Freedman, an analyst with the PNC Financial Corporation in Philadelphia. Among them are Merck & Company, the Lederle Laboratories unit of American Cyanamid and the Wyeth-Ayerst unit of American Home Products. Institut Merieux is also working with Merck to develop a combination pediatric vaccine using a Merck flu vaccine, which would compete with the SmithKline project. Samuel D. Isaly of Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Research projects that world sales of pediatric vaccines will be more than $1 billion by the late 1990's, up from about $750 million now.
