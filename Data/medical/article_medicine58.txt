Downtown Flushing, Queens      Living in ... Downtown Flushing, Queens   Credit Uli Seit for The New York Times       People who live and work in downtown Flushing sometimes call it “the Chinese Manhattan .” Both downtown Flushing, in north-central Queens , and Manhattan are centers of commerce, transportation and finance, and both have shiny new buildings with expensive and sought-after condominiums. “Where else but Manhattan are you going to find a place that stays up 24/7,” said Councilman Peter Koo, who represents Flushing and lives downtown. He also owns several pharmacies there. “It’s really convenient. You can do anything imaginable in a 10-block area.” Downtown Flushing is known for its restaurants, bakeries and Asian specialty stores and its easy transportation into Manhattan. The No. 7 subway line ends at Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, in the center of the neighborhood, and the Long Island Rail Road has a station near the No. 7 train. Dozens of bank branches do business on the main avenues, and a new shopping mall, the Shops at SkyView Center, is fully rented out to national retailers. The neighborhood has the feel of an Asian city. During the morning rush hour, hawkers sell Chinese-language newspapers to commuters heading to the No. 7 train. Colorful fruit and vegetable displays add to the area’s character.  Photo        133-38 SANFORD AVENUE, #15C  A two-bedroom two-bath condo in a new building, listed at $1.08 million.

Brick apartment buildings, some dating to the 1920s, line side streets, along with newer condominium buildings that offer views of Manhattan in the distance, beyond La Guardia Airport.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       From a real estate perspective, “Queens, in general, is really taking off” and “Flushing is the epicenter,” said Michael Dana, the president of Onex Real Estate Partners , the developer of the Shops at SkyView Center as well as of Sky View Parc , the luxury condos above the center at College Point Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue. All 448 Sky View Parc condos have been sold, and early next year construction will begin on a second phase, adding 250 more units by mid-2016, Mr. Dana said. Another sign that developers are bullish on Flushing is a big project that broke ground earlier this year: Flushing Commons . On a five-acre site that was a parking lot, it will include a town square, commercial space and 600 residential units. The first phase is set for completion in 2017. Downtown Flushing’s appeal as a residential neighborhood lies in its concentration of Asian life and culture. While Chinese predominate, there is a sizable Korean community, with its businesses centered around Union Street.

Real estate agents say people seeking to live in the area include Chinese-Americans moving from other New York neighborhoods, new immigrants looking to be close to relatives, wealthy Chinese buyers investing in property to rent out and empty-nesters downsizing from suburban homes. “They would rather be in a two-bedroom apartment in Flushing than a house on Long Island where they feel isolated,” Councilman Koo said. “Everything is here, and they can speak the language.” What You’ll Find The 2010 census put the population of Flushing, encompassing an area beyond downtown, at 72,000 — 69.2 percent Asian, 14.9 percent Hispanic, 9.5 percent white and 4.2 percent African-American. A 2013 Department of City Planning report that looked at new immigration patterns found about two-thirds of Flushing’s population was foreign-born. Most properties for sale downtown are condominiums, ranging from modest units in older buildings to million-dollar-plus apartments in newer ones.

Living then in suburban New Jersey, he wanted to move to New York City for his work. He was seeking value for money, and wooing his companion, Dr. Qinghong Huang, who is Chinese and has an internal medicine practice in Elmhurst.

(718) 762-2288   Credit Uli Seit for The New York Times    “My thought was to buy a really nice place where she would feel comfortable,” Mr. Wesley said. The couple moved into the Flushing condo, which cost $1.25 million, in 2012. “I came to Flushing and fell in love with the community,” he said. For Dr. Huang, he added, it is “the best of both worlds — foods of her childhood and freedoms of America.” What You’ll Pay A search in late September of downtown Flushing listings on the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island , which covers Queens, turned up only a few dozen properties. Inventory is tight, said George Fang, an agent with RE/MAX Universal Real Estate who works in downtown Flushing. “If the price is right, it is going to sell.” Sales prices range from $192,000 for a one-bedroom one-bath co-op in a 1957 brick building on Barclay Avenue to $1.28 million for a six-bedroom duplex in the new Kings Development building on Prince Street. In the middle are one- and two-bedroom apartments in older buildings selling for $250,000 to $500,000. On the high end of the rental market is a four-bedroom penthouse in the sleek Arcadia Condo building on Main Street that Fanny Wang, a sales representative with the Wing Fung Home Realty Group, said she is seeking to rent for $7,000 a month. One-bedroom condo rentals in Victoria Tower on Sanford Avenue, where she is a listing representative, range from around $2,200 to $2,500 a month.

(718) 279-1500   Credit Uli Seit for The New York Times    Mr. Fang said he believes prices in downtown Flushing now exceed pre-recession levels. He said a two-bedroom apartment that sold for $230,000 to $250,000 in 2007 would be priced now at $250,000 to $300,000. The Commute The No. 7 subway line is the main conduit to and from downtown Flushing. An express No. 7 train during the morning rush hour takes around 40 minutes to get to Times Square. The Long Island Rail Road is another option; trains from the Flushing Main Street station take around 20 minutes to Penn Station. About 20 bus lines serve the neighborhood and transport commuters from outlying areas to the No. 7 line. Major highways and airports are in proximity to the neighborhood.

It received a B on its latest Department of Education progress report. Students at Flushing High School , which has 2,400 students in grades 9 through 12, recorded average SAT scores in 2013 of 397 in critical reading, 424 in math and 383 in writing, compared with citywide averages of 437, 463 and 433. What to Do The shops and restaurants of downtown Flushing are a huge draw for residents and outsiders alike. Some of the most interesting excursions are to mini-malls tucked into buildings off Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue. For example, the New World Mall has stores selling groceries, cosmetics, housewares and electronics on its upper floors. In the basement is a huge food court where dozens of stands sell stir-fries, soups, dumplings, bubble teas and hand-pulled noodles. The Shops at SkyView Center is a more modern and Western-style mall where shoppers can choose from any number of national retailers and restaurant chains. Downtown Flushing is within walking distance of the Queens Botanical Garden and is one subway stop from Citi Field , where the New York Mets play, and the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, where the U.S. Open is held. For cultural events, Flushing Town Hall presents a rich program of global arts. The History Flushing was the site of the drafting of a document believed to be one of the earliest in American history proclaiming the right to religious freedom. The document, the Flushing Remonstrance , signed by a group of 30 local residents in 1657, was a response to a decree against Quakers by Gov. Peter Stuyvesant.
