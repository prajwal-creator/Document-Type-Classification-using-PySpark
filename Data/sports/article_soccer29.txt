Sneijder initially claimed the goal, but it was later awarded to Huntelaar. The strike canceled out a 37th-minute goal by Burak Yilmaz. The Netherlands sits in third place in Group A with 5 points, behind the Czech Republic with 13 and Iceland with 12. Vaclav Pilar scored a 90th-minute equalizer for the Czech Republic to salvage a 1-1 draw against Latvia and stay atop the group. Latvia had taken the lead in the first half on a goal by Aleksejs Visnakovs. Iceland beat Kazakhstan, 3-0, in Astana to stay second in Group A, continuing its strong form in qualifying. The veteran Eidur Gudjohnsen celebrated his return from international retirement by opening the scoring with his first goal for Iceland since 2009, and Birkir Bjarnason added a goal in each half. In Group H, a late equalizer from Eder salvaged a 2-2 draw for Italy against Bulgaria in Sofia. Eder, who was making his debut for the Azzurri, scored in the 84th minute after controlling the ball just outside the box and spinning around a defender. The draw left Italy in second place in Group H with 11 points, 2 points behind Croatia, which routed Norway, 5-1, in Zagreb.
