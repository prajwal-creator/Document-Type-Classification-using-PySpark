Is the comely Ms. Cole headed to America to join the U.S. version of “The X Factor”? Is she scouting around for real estate in Los Angeles? Will a seven-year-old assault conviction deny her a U.S. visa? Mail Online is on the case. Readers have noticed. According to the research firm comScore, more than 32 million people flock to the British newspaper’s site every month for the latest on Ms. Cole, as well as news of narrower interest. Its growth curve has been remarkable: Created only two years ago, Mail Online now has the second-largest Web audience of any paper in the world, behind only Nytimes.com , the combined site of The New York Times and the International Herald Tribune. “The great thing about the Internet is that you can be late in and still catch up very quickly,” said Martin Clarke, publisher of the site, on the Web at MailOnline.com . “The reason we were so late was that the revenues didn’t seem that interesting. Once they did, we got into it.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mail Online is a striking example of how newspapers, struggling to develop strategies for the digital future, can use free Web sites to reach huge new audiences as print circulation and advertising decline. But it also illustrates the limitations of this strategy; for all the millions of Web visitors, The Daily Mail’s digital businesses generated a grand total of £12 million, or $18.7 million, in sales in the latest financial year, the paper’s owner, Daily Mail & General Trust, reported last month.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Along with the Web site of The Guardian, Mail Online has been the most prominent example of the free approach in the hypercompetitive British newspaper market, which is emerging as an important laboratory in the debate of free versus paid. On the other side is News Corp., which has already moved two of its British newspapers, The Times and News of the World, behind a paywall, and which plans to do the same for The Sun. This week the owner of another paper, The Telegraph, said it was considering plans to charge Web readers, while The Financial Times has done so for years. “If there’s money in it for them, then good luck to them,” Mr. Clarke said of the News Corp. papers. “We looked at those numbers; we went through them and came to a different conclusion.” Mail Online’s commitment to the free approach is not ideological; a large Web audience, Mr. Clarke said, could be used to market paid services, like the paper’s iPad and iPhone applications, for which it plans to charge users soon. Unlike some other newspaper publishers, The Daily Mail can afford to be patient. It dominates the most lucrative portion of the British newspaper market, the middle ground between serious publications like The Guardian, The Times and The Telegraph and lower-end tabloids like The Sun and The Mirror. As newspapers nearly everywhere shed print readers, The Mail’s daily October circulation of 2.13 million slipped only 1.3 percent from a year earlier, the strongest performance of any of the national British newspapers. Daily Mail & General Trust said last week that The Daily Mail had posted its highest earnings ever for the latest financial year, though it did not say what part of the company’s overall profit of £247 million that represented. Until it introduced Mail Online with content from the newspaper in June 2008, the editors worried that giving it away on the Web would undermine the print version.

But The Mail has preserved differences between the print and online editions by keeping their staffs separate — a strategy that runs counter to the trend at other newspapers, where the buzzword is integration. “Rather than talking about synergies, The Mail is being honest about this: These are very different products, with very different audiences and very different business models,” said Douglas McCabe, an analyst at Enders Analysis in London.

According to comScore, the site’s show business and television coverage drew 15.3 million visitors in October, compared with 14.9 million for the news sections. Analysts say Mail Online’s traffic growth has been fueled by particularly adept use of the art of crafting headlines so that the Web page on which they appear secures a high ranking from Google. Google’s methodology was written by engineers rather than poets, so a straightforward approach to such search engine optimization of headlines generally works best. Thus, a Mail Online story about a sultry Cheryl Cole showing her moody side in a gloomy new music video for her song “The Flood” reads, “Sultry Cheryl Cole shows her moody side in gloomy new video for song The Flood.” The site has been particularly popular among women, who account for 60 percent of its visitors, compared with 46 percent of overall Internet users worldwide, according to comScore. Use of the Internet is growing faster among women than men, and women tend to spend more time on individual sites. Celebrity news is less prominent in the print edition, which often highlights tales of immigrants, European Union officials, single mothers or carcinogens run amok. Those are the bogeymen that stalk Middle England, the bastion of the printed newspaper’s readership. The Mail’s Web site has a broader audience. Not only does the site contain more celebrity news, it also has more foreign coverage, as well as writing about science, history and other topics that get shorter shrift in print, Mr. Clarke said. And, like Ms. Cole, the Web site’s star is on the rise in the United States; with more than 11 million monthly American visitors, it is already the sixth-biggest newspaper Web site there.

One reason for this, analysts say, is the kind of advertising that predominates on the Internet. While marketers use traditional media like television and newspapers to raise general awareness of a brand or product, when they turn to the Web they want to close a sale. Unless consumers are nearby, they are of less interest. For Mail Online, “the value of the overseas audience is a fraction of the value of the U.K. audience,” said Alex Randall, head of online trading at Aegis Media, an agency that buys advertising space and time. Ad revenue from the United States remains minimal, Mr. Clarke acknowledged, and comes in mostly via advertising networks, which scour the Web for bargain-bin deals, rather than directly from advertisers. Though The Mail has created a separate version of its Web site that is edited for U.S. users, he said his main focus was to serve the British audience. “We’re not on some mission for global domination, but clearly we do have an attraction to overseas users, and it would be foolish not to monetize that,” he said. That is one way of explaining why Cheryl Cole, until she makes the move, will sometimes have to share Mail Online’s home page with Kim Kardashian.   A version of this article appears in print on December 6, 2010, in The International Herald Tribune.
