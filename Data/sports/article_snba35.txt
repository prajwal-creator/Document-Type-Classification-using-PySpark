She tested positive for methyltestosterone, an anabolic steroid, in both her A and B samples, the I.O.C. said. Blonska, 30, faces a lifetime ban from track’s world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, because this is her second doping offense. She served a two-year suspension that ended in July 2005 after a positive test for the anabolic steroid stanozolol. The silver medal for the heptathlon will now be awarded to Hyleas Fountain of the United States, who finished third behind the champion Nataliya Dobrynska of Ukraine and Blonska. Tatiana Chernova of Russia, who placed fourth, will move up to collect the bronze medal.

The I.A.A.F. has said it is considering stronger measures than two-year suspensions for doping offenders. Blonska became the fifth athlete to be thrown out of these Olympics for doping. She is the second in track and field . The other offenders were Fani Halkia of Greece, who was the defending Olympic champion in the women’s 400-meter hurdles; María Isabel Moreno, a cyclist from Spain; Thi Ngan Thuong Do, a gymnast from Vietnam; and Jong Su Kim of North Korea, who had to return the silver medal he won in the 50-meter pistol event and the bronze he won in the 10-meter air pistol. The I.O.C. said that it had conducted more than 4,600 doping tests and expected that number to top 5,000.
