When the Americans walked into the National Aquatics Center on Monday night for their first look at the facility known as the Water Cube, they saw a hazy shade of summer. The air inside the swim center was nearly as soupy as outside. The sprinter Dara Torres , who is asthmatic, entered the building with Mark Schubert, the  national team director. As Schubert recounted Tuesday night: “She’s looking up there and she’s going, ‘That can’t be what I think it is.’ And I go, ‘Nah, it’s not.’ ” Torres and Schubert grew up in Southern California, so they know  bad air. What greeted them Monday, Schubert said, “was certainly not any worse than L.A. in the ’70s.” On Tuesday afternoon, it was clear enough to see the Beijing skyline and the Water Cube ceiling. “It was pretty spectacular,” Schubert said. “I think we’re lucky to be indoors. I think the effects will be minimal.” The cloud of controversy hovering over the team since one of its Olympians failed a drug test at the Olympic trials will take longer to dissipate. There was nothing minimal about the effects of Jessica Hardy’s positive test for a banned substance at the United States Olympic trials in July.

Her backup B sample was also positive.

The swim team’s selection process did not have a provision for adding alternates, so as long as Hardy was still on the team, the swimmers who finished third in the 100 breaststroke and 50 free — Tara Kirk and Lara Jackson — could not be put on the roster.

Joyce, seventh in the 100 freestyle, could be added, Schubert said, because Torres had withdrawn and “everybody, from the winner to the sixth-place finisher, is eligible for the relay.” Hardy withdrew from the Olympic team last Friday. Rebecca Soni, who made the Olympic team in the 200 breaststroke and was fourth in the 100 breaststroke, will take Hardy’s place in the 100. In the 50, Hardy’s replacement will be Joyce, who was fourth at the trials. Upon hearing of Hardy’s withdrawal, Kirk said: “I definitely think this is the worst possible result because now I feel like I was second at trials and I don’t get to go to the Olympics.” She added: “I feel like they already changed trials criteria once. I don’t understand why they aren’t willing to do the right thing in this situation.” On Tuesday, while addressing the subject for the first time, Schubert said, “Basically we’re just following the selection procedure.” Asked if the selection process would be revisited, Schubert said: “Absolutely. Rightfully so.”   A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Swimming Team Tries To Find A Clear Sky.
