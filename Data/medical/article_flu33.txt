Monsoor, a member of the Navy Seals. Mr. Monsoor was a Christian of Lebanese and Irish descent, not a Muslim. The article also described incorrectly the act that earned him a Medal of Honor. It was for falling on a grenade and saving at least three team members — not for pulling a team member to safety. (Saving a team member in an earlier incident earned him a Silver Star.) ( Go to Article ) An article on Tuesday about banks’ raising rates and fees on credit card customers ahead of new federal regulations misstated, in some editions, the current total of credit limits in the United States and those limits roughly a year ago. Total credit limits are now $3.4 trillion, not billion, which is a reduction from $4.6 trillion, not billion, a year ago. ( Go to Article ) An article in some editions last Wednesday about Michael R. Bloomberg’s narrow victory in the New York mayoral race and a correction in this space on Friday misspelled the surname of a voter who said Mr. Bloomberg “ran a smear campaign against a nonexistent opponent.” She is Stav Birnbaum, not Brinbaum. ( Go to Article ) NATIONAL A Congressional Memo article in some editions on Sunday about the race for Congress in the 23d District in New York misstated the circumstances of an endorsement in The Watertown Daily News. The paper’s decision to endorse the Democratic candidate, Bill Owens, after the Republican candidate, Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava, withdrew was based solely on internal discussions, according to the editor, John B. Johnson Jr. He said the paper was not “pressed for the endorsement” by Democratic officials. (Mr. Johnson also noted that the decision had been made by the time Mr. Owens asked for the endorsement.) ( Go to Article )   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A report in the Prescriptions column on Saturday about a drug-labeling provision in the Senate health committee’s legislation on health care misidentified the senator who drafted the provision. Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, wrote the measure, which would require the Food and Drug Administration to consider adding statistics about risks and benefits to drugs’ labels. It was not drafted by Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland. (She helped add the measure to a section in the legislation involving health care quality.)

Those doses are meant for patients, workers and volunteers — not just workers. ( Go to Article ) BUSINESS DAY A subheading on Tuesday with an article about the use of old nuclear bomb cores to produce electricity misstated the source of the bomb material used to generate power in the United States. It comes from bombs dismantled by both the United States and Russia — not from Russian bombs alone. ( Go to Article ) THE ARTS An article on Saturday about the planned Broadway musical “Spider-Man, Turn Off the Dark” and a correction in this space on Tuesday misstated the status of advance ticket sales. While there has been no general advance sale, tickets are still available through Ticketmaster to holders of American Express cards; it is not the case that advance tickets are no longer being sold. (As the correction on Tuesday noted, tickets for the production are being handled by Ticketmaster, not Telecharge.) ( Go to Article ) An article on Saturday about a newly published oral history of Joseph Papp and the Public Theater misspelled the surname of one of Papp’s collaborators. He is Stuart Vaughan, not Vaughn. ( Go to Article ) A listing of credits on Saturday with a theater review of “The Lily’s Revenge” at Here Arts Center omitted the surname of a cast member. She is Kayla Asbell. ( Go to Article ) An article on Tuesday about the production of “Dreamgirls” in previews at the Apollo Theater before it goes on national tour misspelled the current name of the theater where the production’s costume designer, William Ivey Long, was working in 1982 and which shared a wall with the Imperial Theater, where “Dreamgirls” was playing. (Mr. Long said that he had wanted to work on “Dreamgirls” since that time.) Formerly the 46th Street Theater, it is now the Richard Rodgers Theater, not Rogers.
