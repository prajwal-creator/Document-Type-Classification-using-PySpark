For instance, if what you see is a man talking to a skull and addressing it by the name Yorick, there’s a 90 percent chance that it’s an outdoor production of a play, not some grisly crime scene. A man in a T-shirt braying crazily about Stella? Seventy-five percent chance it’s a play. A woman behaving provocatively and asking if you want to “go around the corner”? Maybe 50-50. What I’m getting at is, it’s outdoor theater season in New York, and all the city’s a stage; shows are being performed on playgrounds, in parks, on the streets. A particularly fine example drew me to Chinatown last weekend: “The Ryan Case 1873,” an audience-participation murder mystery staged by Carlo D’Amore and his Live IN Theater . The show is based on a real-life double homicide from back when that part of town was known as the Five Points and was full of Irish immigrants who apparently viewed law and order as optional. Mr. D’Amore puts his characters right on the sidewalks, sending audience members out from a starting point at the Church of the Transfiguration on Mott Street in squadrons of 10 or so to question them as suspects in the crime, which left Nicholas and Mary Ryan, brother and sister, dead. It makes for some daftly incongruous moments.  Photo        Dina Massery portays a prostitute who is interrogated by  audience members.

A woman of ill repute named Sally Watkins (Dina Massery), also with a heavy Irish accent, is ready to meet unspecified needs “around the corner,” though our group’s efforts to find out in more detail what that meant were rebuffed when she spurned our offer of two pennies. Perhaps our efforts to calculate the inflation rate since 1873 were flawed.

The actors have tidbits of information they are supposed to divulge if asked the right questions. But this isn’t exactly hit-your-spot, say-your-lines theater. With two wild cards — the audience participation and the uninitiated public that is buzzing around — anything can happen, and at the performance I took in, it did.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Yosef Solanski, a rare Jewish immigrant in the Irish neighborhood that is now Chinese, is crucial to the crime, and he was played by Mr. D’Amore himself. Just as Yosef, a close friend of Mary Ryan’s, was explaining to us that he often slept in yonder park, someone who really does sleep in yonder park came up and called him a liar. He had never seen him in the park, the fellow insisted, and much shouting ensued.  Photo        The wife of the victims' landlord (Alena Acker) answered questions.   Credit Benjamin Norman for The New York Times    It took us investigators a few minutes to realize that this was not part of the performance, and a few more to realize that we had to separate the real homeless man from the fake homeless man so that Mr. D’Amore could continue his bit and not end up in a fight. So some of our group engaged the homeless man in a chat while the others walled off Yosef and continued our interrogation. And Mr. D’Amore somehow got through it without breaking character. That is not always the case when real life intrudes on outdoor theater. Matthew Freeman, a playwright and actor, has this memory of not quite holding it together during a show: “While wearing a yarmulke and playing Fabian in ‘Twelfth Night,’ I was yipped at by a tiny pet dog. I shouted, audibly, ‘Jesus Christ!’ Sort of shattered the illusion.” Sometimes the merger of outdoor performance and real life is more fortuitous. Since 2006, Rohana Elias-Reyes has been directing a scaled-down, child-friendly “Midsummer Night’s Dream” called “Daydream” in places like the Imagination Playground at Prospect Park in Brooklyn, with the play’s “mechanicals” dressed in goofy construction-worker costumes.

Scott Lilly) of course hailed them as fellow mechanicals, and they shouted hello back and started heading over. It was pretty fun to see their faces as they slowly realized that a) our guys were dressed sort of funny for construction work, b) a lot of people were sitting there watching them, and c) this was a play.” Sweet serendipity. Less sweet: Ms. Elias-Reyes also had full-volume barkers selling their water and icy mush right in front of her actors. Meanwhile, back at “The Ryan Case,” there’s Patrick Walsh, who plays the victims’ landlord, Patrick Burke, a particularly unsavory character. For him, the dangerous encounters have come not from the uninitiated public but from the audience (who paid up to $40 a ticket). “Some people take the role of playing a detective way too seriously,” he said. “They try to strong-arm information out of me, literally. Last year I had a gentleman who put me in a headlock and was doing noogies on me.” Another large guy knocked Mr. Walsh off the park bench he likes to stand on in his bit, caught him before he hit the ground, and swung him around in a circle.
