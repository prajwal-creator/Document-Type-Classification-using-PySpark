But long before that missile finds its mark, many others have flown through the air: toothbrushes, a stick of deodorant, wadded paper, apples, even a potted plant. Few objects at rest on the set remain at rest, and those in motion tend to stay in motion. Yet Michael Karas and Jen Slaw , the show’s writers and performers, have more on their minds than Newton’s laws. Expert jugglers, they can toss balls, clubs and rings with the best of them, but what distinguishes “Perfect Catch” from typical shows of circus arts are its story line and humor. Subtitled “A Throw-Mantic Comedy,” it’s a tale of two people falling in love, complete with a soundtrack — “Mister Sandman” to “I Want to Hold Your Hand” — and its own inspired choreography. But not much dialogue: These characters would rather say it with flowers — or fruit or umbrellas or anything else they can fling. They begin as adversaries. Separated by a small partition, they start the hourlong show in their respective apartments, getting ready for work and literally juggling aspects of their morning routines. At the office they toil in side-by-side cubicles, where Mr. Karas’s drone makes the mistake of crumpling his memo-writing efforts and casually throwing them into Ms. Slaw’s space. A paper war ensues, which many children at a recent performance found hilarious. But just as someone of any age can laugh at the Three Stooges — Larry, Moe and Curly actually appear, courtesy of an onstage screen, when the couple go to the movies — adults will delight in the antics too. And as the relationship intensifies, so does the performing. Mr. Karas and Ms. Slaw eat apples and juggle them simultaneously; juggle objects while they hold hands; even juggle while embracing.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   During a romantic dinner a lounge lizard in the form of a Muppet-like puppet lip-syncs Sinatra, ogles Ms. Slaw and even tries to interfere with Mr. Karas’s juggling. The puppet operator? Mr. Karas. (Ms. Slaw is no slouch either; at one point she juggles while wearing a sleeping mask.)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       On Sunday the pair got quite a tribute from notoriously wary New Yorkers: As they moved a club-hurling duet offstage and through the center aisle, no one reflexively ducked. (Saturday and Sunday at 1 and 4 p.m., 508 Canal Street, between Greenwich and West Streets, TriBeCa, 866-811-4111, canalparkplayhouse.com ; $20.) LAUREL GRAEBER For Children ‘The Adventures of Maya the Bee’ (Saturday) This feisty puppet heroine has buzzed back to the Culture Project, where her journey began a dozen years ago. Based on a children’s book by the German author Waldemar Bonsels, “The Adventures of Maya the Bee” relates the title character’s flight from the hive in search of tastes more exotic than honey. The revival has new sets and props, but the same intricate rod and shadow puppets designed by Zofia Czechlewska. Adapted by Rachel Klein, with a score and lyrics by the jazz artist Nancy Harrow, who also conceived the show, “Maya” is a jazz musical for children, and how often do you encounter those? (The run is open-ended.) Saturdays at 10:30 a.m., 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org ; $25. ‘Archaeology Zone: Discovering Treasures From Playgrounds to Palaces’ (Friday, Sunday through Tuesday, and Thursday) Children will step into the shoes of an explorer like Indiana Jones in this permanent exhibition at the Jewish Museum, but the adventures will be purely scholarly. Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show, for ages 3 to 10, also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. From 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8 p.m. on Thursdays and to 4 p.m. on Fridays. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org . Free with admission: $12; $10 for 65+; $7.50 for students; free for under 12 and members. ‘The Art of “Rise of the Guardians” ’ (Friday through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) How did they do that? This question frequently comes to mind when viewing the complex animation in some of today’s films, and now the Museum of the Moving Image offers visitors an answer for one of those movies: “Rise of the Guardians,” a recent DreamWorks release. This new exhibition consists of more than 25 original drawings and sketches, along with design materials, production artifacts and behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the film, an adventure about immortal heroes like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. (Through March 3.) The show is accompanied by a retrospective weekend screening series of DreamWorks films. This Friday at 1 p.m. the museum will screen “Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted” (2012), a 3-D production in which the creatures of the “Madagascar” series go through Europe in their quest to get back to New York. This Saturday and Sunday at 1 p.m. the film is the animated “Over the Hedge” (2006), which pits enterprising forest animals against arriviste humans in the quest for a suburban food supply. Museum hours: 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays; to 8 p.m. on Fridays; 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekends; 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us . Exhibition and screenings are free with admission: $12; $9 for students and 65+; $6 for ages 3 to 12; free for under 3, members and to all on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. ‘Beauty and the Beast’ (Saturday and Sunday) Yes, it’s that tale as old as time, but Literally Alive Children’s Theater is putting a different spin on it in this new musical adaptation by Michael Sgouros and Brenda Bell. This version draws heavily on Jean Cocteau’s 1946 black-and-white fantasy film of the work, as well as on the original story. Tickets include a preshow workshop in which children meet cast members and make Beauty or Beast masks to take home. (Through May 4.) Saturdays at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.; Sundays at 11 a.m.; workshop starts one hour before each performance; Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, at Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, literallyalive.com ; $25 to $45. ‘Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale of Musical Mystery’ (Saturday and Sunday) Bunnies innocent and maybe not so innocent are the subject of the first Rabbit Season at DR2 Kids Theater, which is following up its recent production of “The Velveteen Rabbit” with “Bunnicula,” another collaboration with Theaterworks USA. An adaptation of the children’s book series by Deborah and James Howe, “Bunnicula” focuses on a pet rabbit with peculiar eating habits, and even more peculiar fangs. None other than Charles Busch (“The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife”) wrote the book for the show, which has music by Sam Davis and lyrics by Mark Waldrop. (Through April 14.) At 1 and 4 p.m., DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, dr2kidstheatre.com ; twusa.org ; $45; $35 for groups.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   B.Y.O.K.: Bill Harley and Keith Munslow (Sunday) Mr. Harley and Mr. Munslow, each prominent in the children’s music scene, are celebrating their first collaboration: an album called “It’s Not Fair to Me” (Round River Records). Hmm, ever hear that refrain before? It was the winning entry in their contest to come up with a name for a children’s song, and they wrote the title track to suit it. Other subjects treated on the new CD, the centerpiece of this concert in the B.Y.O.K. (Bring Your Own Kid) series at 92YTriBeCa, include ugly sweaters, disobedient dogs and whiny little brothers. At 11 a.m., 200 Hudson Street, at Canal Street, (212) 601-1000, 92ytribeca.org ; $15; free for under 2. Children’s Theater Company (Saturday) In New York you’re never too little for the stage, and this company welcomes actors as young as 5. Its latest showcase, playing in Manhattan and on Long Island, features four musicals adapted from books. “Rescue Me: A Musical History of Women,” by Dorothy Marcic, uses popular song and an adolescent ensemble to show how America’s female citizens acquired their rights. The bill also includes “Lorax and Money Bags,” inspired by Dr. Seuss, and “Miss Spider’s Tea Party,” based on David Kirk’s picture book — both adapted by Lory Lazarus in collaboration with Mehr Mansuri — and Kristina Golmohammadi’s “Mio, My Son,” from a book by Astrid Lindgren. (Through March 10.) Saturdays at 4:30 p.m., Baha’i Unity Center, 53 East 11th Street, East Village; Sundays at 4:30 p.m., 11 West Jamaica Avenue, Valley Stream, N.Y.

And dancing will be encouraged at this concert, as well as singalongs and other forms of audience involvement. The group’s music, as exemplified on its latest album, “Sock-a-Delic,” is a signature mix of rock, funk, hip-hop and country, recommended for ages 2 and older. At 2 p.m., the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org ; $18; $13 for children; $15 and $11 for those with family-level memberships. Family Tour of Rockefeller Center (Sunday) Many New Yorkers probably think they know Rockefeller Center, but this walking tour from the Municipal Art Society, part of the Family Time series for parents with children 8 through 14, will show its more hidden side, including underground passages and little-known treasures. The tour, led by the art historian Sylvia Laudien-Meo, will also offer sketching opportunities, with investigations of murals and sculptures celebrating modern achievements. At 11 a.m., (212) 935-2075, mas.org/tours ; $20; $15 for Municipal Art Society members. Reservations required. ‘Fancy Nancy the Musical’ (Saturday and Sunday) One of the arts’ youngest divas is back onstage at the McGinn/Cazale Theater. This musical from Vital Theater Company focuses on a little girl who wants everything to be fancy — especially herself. Based on the book series written by Jane O’Connor and illustrated by Robin Preiss Glasser, the production explores the predicament that ensues when Nancy finds out that she hasn’t been cast as the glamorous mermaid she’d hoped to be in the coming dance show. With a book by Susan DiLallo, a score by Danny Abosch, and lyrics by both, the musical humorously follows Nancy’s attempts to cope with a most unfancy role: that of a tree. (Through April 28; it closes this Sunday and then resumes on April 13.) At 3:30 p.m., 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 579-0528, vitaltheatre.org ; $29.50; $49.50 for premium seats; this weekend’s shows are almost completely sold out. Film Forum Jr.: ‘The Circus’ (Sunday) Film Forum, the downtown cinema, is now the proud parent of Film Forum Jr., a new series (through March 31) introducing classic movies to children. This week’s title is “The Circus” (1928), a silent film starring Charlie Chaplin as a suspected thief being chased by the police. He dashes into a circus tent, where he flees through a hall of mirrors, into a lion’s cage and eventually onto a tightrope. At 11 a.m., 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org ; $7. ‘The Firebird’ and ‘Bark! In the Park’ (Saturday and Sunday) Creatures feathered and furry are on the bill as New York Theater Ballet presents its latest dance program for children. In addition to “The Firebird,” based on the Russian folk tale and choreographed by Richard Holden to Stravinsky’s score, the company will offer the premiere of “Bark! In the Park.” This new ballet, choreographed by Chase Brock to music by Karen LeFrak, takes place in Central Park, where two children are searching for their lost dog. Along the way, they encounter animals from squirrels to snow leopards, all ready to dance. Saturday at 1 p.m.; Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 and 3:30 p.m.; Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160, nytb.org ; $40; $35 for 12 and under; $45 for premium seats. (Tickets bought through Ticketmaster via the company Web site incur a substantial surcharge.) ‘Flight of the Butterflies’ (Friday through Thursday) It’s easy to think of the graceful creatures that are the subject of this fascinating film as traveling only short distances, flitting from flower to flower. But half a billion monarch butterflies actually migrate 3,000 miles every fall, to Mexico from Canada. A new Imax movie, this project chronicles their journey and the 40-year investigation of it by one impassioned scientist, Fred A. Urquhart. (Visitors can also see as many as 500 free-flying real butterflies in the special exhibition “The Butterfly Conservatory: Tropical Butterflies in Winter,” through May 28.) The film runs through July 7, hourly, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5200, amnh.org . Included in Museum Plus One admission (general admission and one Imax film or special exhibition): $25; $19 for students and 60+; $14.50 for ages 2 to 12. Member tickets: $12.50; $8 for children.

The stars are the members of the Yang family: Fan and Ana Yang and their son Deni and others, who rotate as M.C.’s for the production. Audience members may even find themselves in bubbles of their own. (The run is open-ended.)

Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Grug’ (Friday through Sunday, and Thursday) Almost anything can come to life in a children’s book, but the title character of the series that inspired this show still seems unusual: the detached top of a burrawang tree. Burrawangs grow in Australia, where Grug is a huge hero to the little readers of Ted Prior’s picture books. Now he’s onstage in this production from the Windmill Theater of Australia, presented here by the New Victory Theater. Windmill has recreated Grug and his adventures in a 45-minute play for the youngest theatergoers: ages 2 to 5. (Through March 17.) Friday at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday at 10:30 a.m. and 12:30 and 2:30 p.m.; Thursday at 10:30 a.m.; New 42nd Street Studios, Studio 3A/B, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org ; $20; $14 for members. Some performances are sold out. ‘Hollow’ (Saturday) Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman are off and riding again in this new musical from Be Bold! Productions. Inspired by Washington Irving’s “Legend of Sleepy Hollow” and recommended for theatergoers older than 8, this show, by Michael Sgouros and Brenda Bell, focuses on the love triangle and the mystery inherent in Irving’s tale. (Through March 30.) At 5:30 p.m., Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, at Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, hollowthemusical.com ; $35 to $50. ‘House of Ghostly Haunts’ (Tuesday) Children old enough to appreciate a few chills along with their chuckles can investigate Cardone the Vaudeville Magician, whose show closes this week at Canal Park Playhouse. In his “House of Ghostly Haunts” Cardone specializes in illusions like swallowing razor blades, dropping guillotines and conjuring the spirit of Elvis. The show admits no one younger than 7; the last 10 minutes unfold in complete darkness. At 7 p.m., 508 Canal Street, near Greenwich Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, canalparkplayhouse.com ; $20; dinner from the theater’s Waffle Iron Café is also available before or after the show. Jazz for Kids (Sunday) Every Sunday during most of the school year the Jazz Standard presents not just jazz for kids, but also jazz by kids: the featured players at its Sunday brunches are the members of the Jazz Standard Youth Orchestra, a group of talented young people ages 11 to 18. In this series, which is celebrating its 10th year, the musicians play new arrangements of big-band classics while listeners enjoy barbecue offerings that include a children’s menu. (Through May 13.) Doors open at 1 p.m.; shows are from 1:30 to 3 p.m.; 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net/mobi/kids . Free; in lieu of a cover charge, guests make a $5 donation, which benefits the Jazz Standard Discovery Program, an initiative that brings musical performances to city schools. Kids Week at the Intrepid (Friday through Sunday) The U.S.S. Intrepid, the aircraft carrier turned museum, is celebrating much more than military history this weekend, as it concludes a week of special entertainment for children. Intrepid Ports of Call Day, on Friday, offers interactive stations celebrating eight countries, where young visitors can enjoy themed crafts, like origami at the Japan port and mask making at the Brazilian one. Sports ’n Games Weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, will include appearances by members of New York teams — the Jets, the Rangers, the Knicks and the Liberty — as well as activities like an obstacle course and basketball dribbling. Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, Pier 86, 46th Street and 12th Avenue, Clinton, (877) 957-7447, intrepidmuseum.org .

That’s what Catherine Fowles and Jara Jones are attempting in Off Broadway Family Theater’s first production, le Clanché du Rand’s adaptation of C. S. Lewis’s classic novel. (The run is open-ended.) At 11 a.m., St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, narniaoffbroadway.com ; $35. Mario the Magician (Sunday) Looking to create amusement as well as amazement, Mario the Magician performs slapstick-inspired routines and has an avian sidekick: a dove named Mozzarella. He will engage the young audience in his act, which is geared to ages 3 through 11 and is influenced by classic comedians like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. At 2:30 p.m., Space on White, 81 White Street, between Broadway and Lafayette Street, TriBeCa, (917) 605-0662, mariothemagician.com ; $20; $10 for ages 12 and under. ‘The Mark of Zorro’ (Friday through Sunday) How can you lure children raised on computer-generated imagery and high-tech special effects to a swashbuckling adventure with only three actors, a few props and dozens of plastic cutouts? You’d need clever design, highly skilled performers and plenty of fancy footwork. That’s mostly what you get in this adaptation of the tale of the masked justice-seeker Zorro, performed by Visible Fictions, a Scottish troupe, and closing this weekend. The story’s violence may give some parents pause, but in pure inventiveness, the show is a triumph. Friday at 7 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 5 p.m.; 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org ; $14 to $38; $9 to $25 for members.

The interactive show, inspired by the Chinese epic “The Journey to the West,” recreates many of the Monkey’s adventures, like fighting the Bull Demon at a station that resembles a video game. Much of the fun teaches Chinese values: cooperation, perseverance, bravery and self-sacrifice. (Through May.) Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; to 7 p.m. on Saturdays. Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1223, cmom.org . Free with admission: $11; $7 for 65+; free for under 1 and members. ‘My Mom Is Trying to Ruin My Life’ (Saturday through Monday) Every child knows that mothers are endless sources of love — and endless sources of embarrassment. This new musical, inspired by the picture book of the same title by Kate Feiffer, explores all the cringe-inducing things done by the mother of a little girl named Emma, which include kissing her in public and bringing her things at school. Ms. Feiffer wrote the show’s book with M J Bruder Munafo; Paul Jacobs composed the score; and Sarah Durkee wrote the lyrics. (Through March 10.) Saturday at noon and 3 p.m.; Sunday at noon; Monday at 7 p.m.; Workshop Theater, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan, workshoptheater.org ; $18; $15 for students and 65+. ‘Pippi’ (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Children’s literature had at least one feminist heroine long before the feminist era: Pippi Longstocking, the pint-size, pigtailed, redheaded dynamo who lived independently and fought off villains with the help of pluck and superhuman strength. Now the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater is reviving its 2007 musical based on the Pippi stories by the Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. With a book by Zakiyyah Alexander and a score by Daryl Kojak, the production features almost two dozen handmade marionettes. Friday through Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., with additional 3 p.m. performances on Saturday and Sunday; Tuesday through Thursday at 10:30 a.m. and noon; 79th Street and the West Drive, Central Park, (212) 988-9093, cityparksfoundation.org/arts ; $8; $5 for ages 12 and under.

Justin Roberts and the Not Ready for Naptime Players (Saturday) Mr. Roberts, once the leader of the indie band Pimentos for Gus, as well as a former Montessori preschool teacher, is now putting his professional talents to use by performing music for the youngest rockers.

Musical Mysteries’ (Friday through Sunday) Scooby-Doo, that cartoon series Great Dane with a nose for snacks — and trouble — has lumbered onto the stage in this live production. Written by Theresa Borg and based on the animated television show, this musical gathers Scooby’s human entourage — the enterprising teenagers Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma — to help solve a mystery involving a haunted theater. Friday at 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m. and 2 and 5 p.m.; Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (866) 858-0008, tinyurl.com/b6enwu7 ; $40 to $75. ‘Show Way’ (Saturday and Sunday) Masters usually didn’t allow slaves to learn to read or write, but many captives did know how to sew. What those slaves made — and how that stitching became a powerful language itself — forms the heart of “Show Way,” Vital Theater Company’s accomplished new musical, based on the children’s book of the same title by Jacqueline Woodson. With a book by Melody Cooper and music and lyrics by Tyrone L. Robinson, the show examines the entwined histories of Mathis, a slave, and Toshi Georgiana, her 11-year-old contemporary descendant, who has lost a precious family heirloom: a quilt square. (Through March 3.) At 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., McGinn-Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212) 579-0528, vitaltheatre.org ; $25 and $30. ‘Silly Stocking Stories and Songs’ (Saturday) It’s a good bet that the members of size2shoes don’t wear Size 2 shoes, but they’re good at entertaining those who do. This duo from Ireland, consisting of the brothers Owen and Moley O Suilleabhain, will present a children’s show at the Irish Arts Center in which they will perform contemporary Irish rap and beat boxing, as well as sean-nos, or old-style, Irish songs. At 11 a.m., 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, irishartscenter.org/kids.htm ; $15. ‘10-Foot Cops: The NYPD’s Mounted Unit’ (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Not all of the heroes of the Police Department walk on two legs; this new exhibition at the Children’s Museum of Manhattan celebrates the horses of the mounted unit and the officers who ride them. Lent by the New York City Police Museum, temporarily closed because of damage from Hurricane Sandy, the show includes uniforms, paintings, historical photos, film clips, a reproduction of a police stable and a saddle for children to pose in. From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; to 7 p.m. on Saturdays; Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1223, cmom.org .
