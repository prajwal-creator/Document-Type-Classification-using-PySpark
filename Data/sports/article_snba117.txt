There will be two teams from the Boston area, one composed of women from western Massachusetts and northern Connecticut, and two made up of women from Fairfield and Westchester Counties. Each 12-player squad will compete against all the others. The top 30 players in this tournament will be selected to participate in a tryout on May 22-23. The best from this group will go to Washington representing New England on Memorial Day weekend to compete for selection on the United States National Team, which represents the United States in international tournaments and tours in other countries such as Canada, Britain and Australia. They will also be competing for a chance to play in a final selection session in June, from which the best 16 players in the country will be chosen for a fall trip to England, where America will try to retain its world championship. Two players from the area have made it to the international level in past years. One is Ellen Remsen, who lives in Greenwich and is a national team player at right defense wing. She made the last touring team that went to Australia last year. The other is Lynn Ingalls, who lives and works in New York City, but plays for the Westchester Women's Lacrosse Association, a team of post-college women based at Greenwich Academy, who have been practicing and playing together since February. Miss Ingalls plays first home, an attack position, and learned how to play lacrosse at the academy.

It has been the site of numerous New England District tournaments, and has a women's lacrosse program that starts with girls in the fifth grade. Women's lacrosse puts a premium on skill in passing, running and shooting. Because there are no boundaries, and play is virtually continuous in 25-minute halves with no substitutions, stamina is important. ''When we start teaching the young girls, the fifth graders, we only work with the basic skills,'' said Angela Tammaro, the head of women's athletics at Greenwich Academy. ''We didn't even tell them what the positions are until about a week ago. We work on stickwork, catching and passing. If they learn these then, they will be able to enjoy the game later on.'' There are about 125 girls playing lacrosse at Greenwich Academy.  Teams play by grade level through the ninth grade. The older players then are divided into three teams according to ability.

''Lacrosse is a wide open aerial game. It has less restrictions than say basketball or hockey. The girls love the game, although many can't say why.'' Miss Tammaro joined Greenwich Academy in 1965. The program has grown there as it has in other areas in Fairfield County.  ''All the prep schools play lacrosse now. There are about 25 in the area,'' said Miss Tammaro. ''And now the public schools are beginning to be competitive, particularly Greenwich High School. But we don't have one college in the area that plays women's lacrosse. ''We have become a real powerhouse now,'' she continued. ''We've only lost once, to Princeton Country Day School, but we beat an English high school touring team that was the best in Britain. ''Many of our girls go to colleges with strong hockey and lacrosse programs - Princeton, Harvard, Smith, Richmond or schools up north such as Middlebury or Amherst. One of our seniors, Alex Hughes, for instance, is going to Penn State, one of the top women's lacrosse schools in the country, and Tracy Graham, who plays left defense wing, is going to Richmond. ''But after college,'' she said, ''most of them stop playing. They have jobs, they get married and start families.''

Two years ago the association, the term used in women's lacrosse for a group of teams based in an area, was in trouble. Few players knew about it, and few played for it. The association has undergone a dramatic change, due in part to the efforts of Miss Ingalls, who became president two years ago. She started a word-ofmouth campaign and advertised in local papers. The results were that the association now has a solid core of 25 steady players, three of whom play for the Greenwich Academy varsity team. About half the players come from Connecticut. The others are from Westchester County or New York City. They have played in a variety of tournaments this spring, traveling to Delaware and Cape Cod and playing host to the new Beth Allen Classic recently in Greenwich. There is a new seriousness about the game among the players. Miss Ingalls, a technician in biochemistry at Einstein College of Medicine in New York, has been working out on body-building equipment here, and practicing at Greenwich during the week as well as playing on weekends. Will she be able to go to England?  ''Not this time,'' she said. ''But Elly Remsen does want to go.  What we want to do is have a good tournament next weekend, and then do well in Washington.''
