Credit Ian Thomas Jansen-Lonnquist for The New York Times  Good Tuesday morning from Washington, where a Supreme Court justice is urging his colleagues to seek wisdom from abroad and Republicans with an eye on the White House are juggling the campaign trail with the fund-raising circuit. Social Security is resurfacing as a hot topic for conservatives, and Hillary Rodham Clinton is waxing nostalgic about the good old days in New Hampshire – and hoping for more good ones ahead.  Presidential candidates must pretend that they have a special connection to every state they visit, but it’s not hard to see that Mrs. Clinton wishes they all could be like New Hampshire.  “I was really anxious to get to New Hampshire,” Mrs. Clinton told about 50 supporters at a small campaign house party in Claremont, N.H. “I just called Bill and I said, ‘You won’t guess, I am on my way from Keene to Claremont.’ We have a pretty big part of our heart committed to New Hampshire.”  It was in Keene, the 67-year-old Mrs. Clinton explained, that she celebrated her 44th birthday in 1991 while her husband campaigned for his life ahead of the state’s primary. The state’s independent-minded voters handed him a second-place finish in the contest, and he earned the nickname “the Comeback Kid.”  Then, in 2008, just a day after Mrs. Clinton got teary in a diner in Portsmouth — a rare public display of emotion at a pivotal moment in the campaign — the state gave her an unlikely victory against Barack Obama .  “I listened to you, and, in the process, I found my own voice,” she said in her victory speech.  In this campaign, she wants to do a little more listening, and a little less in her own voice. On Monday, she waved off new attacks from Republicans as partisan distractions and kept her focus on voters and “everyday” Americans.  When asked whether the small events she has opened her campaign with here and in Iowa were overly staged, Mrs. Clinton replied: “This is exactly what I want to do. I want to hear from people in New Hampshire about what’s on their minds.”  On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton will take her listening tour to the New Hampshire Technical Institute, a community college in Concord, followed by a round-table discussion with students and employees.  — Amy Chozick   Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates .  What We’re Watching Today  President Obama will huddle with Ashton B. Carter , the defense secretary, in the Oval Office.  The Senate Finance Committee holds a 10 a.m. hearing on congressional trade policy.  Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey speaks at the Annual Washington Conference on the Americas .  Republicans Dance Around Social Security ‘Third Rail’  Social Security — making it solvent, protecting it from privatization, and raising the retirement age for it — is quickly becoming a point of contention in the 2016 presidential race.  Mr. Christie , looking to breathe new life into his presidential prospects, last week in New Hampshire laid out a plan for entitlement overhaul, a specific, point-by-point address for means-testing Social Security, and for raising the retirement age over time to 69.  On Friday, at a candidate forum sponsored by the New Hampshire Republican Party, Mr. Christie talked about his plan as touching the “third rail” of politics, proving his willingness to take on the tough fights that others avoid.  Other Republicans followed suit over the weekend. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, whose constituents include a number of retirees, both called for similar proposals to the ones Mr. Christie is making.  Yet the Republican field has, at different points, ventured toward this third rail over the last few years. Researchers for American Bridge, the Democratic “super PAC,” found footage of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky endorsing means-testing in February. Three years earlier, he said the retirement age would need to be raised or there would be “rioting in the streets.”  Rattling the nerves of older voters, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas famously called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” during his Senate race. And former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said last year that increasing the retirement age should not be a “difficult discussion.”  For Democrats, the issue is a matter of little debate. Mrs. Clinton said in New Hampshire on Monday that Social Security must be preserved and should not be messed with: “We do not pretend that it is a luxury, because it is not a luxury.”  — Maggie Haberman  Our Favorites From Today’s Times  Under Republican control, Congress is making some rare legislative progress .  The Upshot argues that Mike Huckabee could be a more formidable candidate than people think.  The billionaire Koch brothers signaled that Mr . Walker would be their preferred Republican nominee.  Breyer to Urge Supreme Court to Seek Wisdom Abroad  Justice Stephen G. Breyer has a new book coming out in September, on a provocative topic that has divided his colleagues on the Supreme Court.  “My aim in this book,” Justice Breyer wrote, “is to show how and why the Supreme Court must increasingly consider the world beyond our national frontiers.”  Justice Breyer has been debating versions of that issue for at least a decade with his primary intellectual adversary on the court, Justice Antonin Scalia .  In remarks at a joint appearance at American University in 2005, for instance, Justice Scalia said it was improper to consider foreign law in interpreting the United States Constitution. Justice Breyer was not as categorical.  “We, on occasion at least, can learn something about our country and our law and our document from what happens elsewhere,” he said.  The new book is called “The Court and the World: American Law and the New Global Realities,” and it will consider, its publisher said, how American law should take account of international practices in areas like human rights, copyright and securities fraud.  Justice Breyer said the increasing complexity of the world required greater judicial engagement with it.  “The number of cases concerning foreign or international matters has grown exponentially,” he said. “As a result, we must now consider relevant legal, as well as factual, circumstances arising beyond our shores.”  — Adam Liptak  What We’re Reading Elsewhere  Time reports that Mr. Bush ’s former technology guru , who was ousted for old, offensive tweets, has created an app that will help others avoid his fate .  Politico profiles the woman who brought Mrs. Clinton to tears in New Hampshire in 2008.  Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland garnered attention for using an off-color word in an interview with NPR to describe the Republican argument that regulation is bad for the poor.  Mr. Paul plans to take a break from the campaign trail to play in Roll Call’s annual congressional baseball game in June.  Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
