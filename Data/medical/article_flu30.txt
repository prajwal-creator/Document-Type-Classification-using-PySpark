McNEIL Jr. SEPT. 15, 2009     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           In a study with implications for swine flu treatment, British researchers have found that some patients with severe breathing problems do better if their blood is run through a heart-lung machine than if they are attached to a conventional ventilator. If swine flu hospitalizations increase rapidly as the winter gets colder, pressure could rise to put the sickest patients on such machines, which oxygenate the blood without forcing air into the lungs, giving lung tissue the chance to rest and heal. Only 80 to 100 hospitals in the United States have them — though that is far more than in Britain, where resources were heavily taxed even in its relatively small flu outbreak last spring. “We have already used ECMO during the first wave of the pandemic with good effect, and we are expecting ECMO to prove an invaluable weapon in the fight against the winter resurgence of the infection,” said one of the study’s authors, Dr. Giles Peek, at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, England, using the shorthand for the official name for the therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The study was published online Tuesday in The Lancet . The technology, a smaller version of the heart-lung machine used in open-heart surgery, has been around since the 1980s and has saved the lives of thousands of premature infants with underdeveloped lungs, said Dr. Joseph B. Zwischenberger, an ECMO expert and a chest surgeon at the medical school at the University of Kentucky, who wrote a commentary on the study for The Lancet.

The British study, which took eight years and screened 766 patients to find two groups of 90 to undergo competing treatments, found that ECMO gave adults a 16 percent better chance of survival. The study, paid for by Britain’s national health service, originally had nothing to do with swine flu and was created to help national health officials judge whether the benefits of the expensive technology outweighed its risks enough to justify the cost.

But because the blood must be thinned, creating a constant danger of hemorrhaging or clots, it requires far closer monitoring: one therapist per one or two patients 24 hours a day, while a respiratory technician can monitor up to 10 patients on ventilators and a nurse can watch up to 4, Dr. Zwischenberger estimated. Vaccine Is Approved WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration approved the new swine flu vaccine, a long-anticipated step as the government works to start mass vaccinations next month.
