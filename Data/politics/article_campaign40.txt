Will voters fall in line behind a man who declares “I am your voice” and “I am the law and order candidate,” a man who looks more than 30 million television viewers in the eye as he says Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. Trump is the candidate of the massive and unruly rally, seemingly always on the edge of violence , the candidate who dismisses critics and opponents as weak losers and who whips up mass audiences via Twitter, the 21st century counterpart to the Depression-era radio rants of Father Coughlin and Charles Lindbergh — the aviator-turned-isolationist who brought us the original America First movement. Trump’s entire campaign is premised on the primal assault of an in-group against an out-group. More brazenly than any major party presidential contender in American history, he promises voters the comfort, security and even happiness that autocratic leaders claim they can provide. He has based his presidential bid on the yearning for authoritarian leadership that he believes animates a majority of the voting public. Who are Trump’s followers? Matthew MacWilliams , in a chapter of the forthcoming book, “ Why Irrational Politics Appeals ,” writes that those who support Trump stand out because of two variables: “authoritarianism and a personalized fear of terrorism.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   MacWilliams, a doctoral candidate in political science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, goes on to argue in a companion essay that: Trump’s success in the Republican primaries this year is demonstrably different than what has occurred in America’s political past. It is instead “the rise of American authoritarianism – America’s Authoritarian Spring.” As the world knows, Trump set out to tap voters’ fears in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention on July 21st, arguing that 2016 is a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       There is a striking array of statistical data linking Trump to voters disposed to believe in the value of authoritarian control. Robert P. Jones, the C.E.O. of the Public Religion Research Institute, wrote in an email responding to my inquiry: Although openness to authoritarian leadership is a very difficult thing to measure, a recent P.R.R.I./Brookings survey found that there may be more receptivity than conventional wisdom might suggest. The P.R.R.I. survey measured the authoritarian leanings of voters versus the autonomous leaning of voters by using a series of questions that ask what values parents seek to instill in their children. The survey found that A majority of Americans prefer children to have respect for elders (74 percent) rather than independence (26 percent); to demonstrate good manners (70 percent) rather than curiosity (30 percent); and to be well-behaved (61 percent) rather than creative (38 percent). P.R.R.I. ranked respondents on a scale of highly autonomous, autonomous, mixed, authoritarian and highly authoritarian: A majority of Americans favor either highly authoritarian (31 percent) or authoritarian (26 percent) traits. In contrast, roughly one-quarter express preferences for either highly autonomous (10 percent) or autonomous (13 percent) traits. One in five Americans (20 percent) has mixed preferences. Most notably, according to P.R.R.I., Americans who have a highly authoritarian orientation are more than twice as likely as those who have a highly autonomous orientation to say the country needs a leader who is willing to break the rules to set things right (58 percent vs. 22 percent). The accompanying chart shows the distribution of authoritarian versus autonomous values across the entire population.

Source: PRRI/Brookings Institution 2016 Immigration Survey   AUG. 4, 2016  Charts by Bill Marsh/The New York Times       The basic finding — that a solid majority values respect and good behavior more than creativity and independence — helps to explain why Trump has continued to be competitive so far. The autocratic character of his bid is also revealed in his espousal of conspiracy theories, his speculation about “rigged” elections, once and future, as well as in his fundamental rejection of deliberative processes. Trump’s convention speech was specifically geared to more authoritarian-friendly voters: I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order in our country. According to the P.R.R.I. survey, 57 percent of “high authoritarians” worry that they or a family member will be a victim of terrorism compared to 24 percent of those “who have a highly autonomous orientation”; 62 percent of high authoritarians agree that “American culture and way of life has mostly changed for the worse since the 1950s,” compared to 22 percent of “high autonomous” individuals. While Trump does much better among those who favor authoritarianism than among those who do not, he must extend his support beyond this constituency. That is why his basic message of fear and threat is crucial to his bid. “Ordinary citizens who feel their safety is threatened will tend to support relatively ‘authoritarian’ policies perceived as helping to ensure public safety,” Marc J. Hetherington and Elizabeth Suhay, political scientists at Vanderbilt and American Universities respectively, write in their 2011 essay “Authoritarianism, Threat, and Americans’ Support for the War on Terror” in the American Journal of Political Science .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Among those with low levels of authoritarian response to the child-rearing test battery and those “who perceived little threat from terrorism, 37 percent favored media censorship,” Hetherington and Suhay report. “But for low authoritarians who perceived significant threat, that percentage nearly doubled, to 68 percent.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But among those who felt a significant threat from terrorism but who also ranked low in authoritarian leanings, 49 percent favored force. In other words, insofar as Trump can elevate the level of anxiety — about terrorism, immigrants and crime, for example — the larger the number of voters who will be drawn to his brand of autocratic leadership. The accompanying chart demonstrates how fear of terrorist attack undermines the principled opposition to censorship of those committed to autonomy and creativity. As their fear of attack rises, their opposition to censorship steadily declines.   O.K. With Censorship  A political science study found that, as people's worries about terrorism increased, even those who were less authoritarian-leaning supported media censorship.                The most authoritarian people  had a high tolerance for censorship whether they were worried about terrorism or not.    Percent predicted to support media censorship:    100%    75    MIDDLE AUTHORITARIAN      50    The least authoritarian  became much more comfortable with censorship as fear rose.    25    Not  worried  at all    Not  very  worried    Somewhat  worried    Very  worried            Source: Marc J. Hetherington, Vanderbilt University, and Elizabeth Suhay, American University   AUG. 4, 2016  By The New York Times    MacWilliams expands upon the Hetherington-Suhay findings, demonstrating that the effect of fear of terrorism on support for Trump among less authoritarian voters is unmistakable. The more fearful non-authoritarians are of the threat posed by terrorism, the more likely they are to support Donald Trump. In his acceptance speech , Trump made a clear case for authoritarian leadership, as he attempted to convince a majority of voters that “the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities” revealed an America where 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. Seen in this light, it is Trump’s portrayal of America as vulnerable to threat from within and without that the sunny Democratic convention sought to rebut. On July 27, President Obama led the chorus : I stand before you again tonight, after almost two terms as your president, to tell you I am more optimistic about the future of America than ever before. How could I not be — after all that we’ve achieved together? After the worst recession in 80 years, we fought our way back. We’ve seen deficits come down, 401(k)’s recover, an auto industry set new records, unemployment reach eight-year lows, and our businesses create 15 million new jobs. Obama might as well have been saying that those who prize autonomy need not be drawn to authoritarian solutions out of fear. Hillary Clinton in her own acceptance speech, rejected Trump’s invocation of dread — his effort to amass support for the concentration of power in the White House — and called him out by name: He’s betting that the perils of today’s world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He’s taken the Republican Party a long way from “morning in America” to “midnight in America.” He wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Preliminary evidence suggests that in the contest between Trump’s pessimistic appeal for autocracy and Clinton’s counter claim that “we will all work together so we can all rise together,” Clinton came out ahead. Gallup surveys conducted immediately after the Republican and Democratic conventions showed that voters by 45 percent to 41 percent were more likely to support Clinton and still less likely to support Trump (51 to 36 percent). The list of Republican defectors , which has grown recently, signals the party’s deepening alarm about its candidate’s own alarmism.

When nearly 7 out of every 10 voters believe the country is on the wrong track, there is clear potential for a candidate like Trump who focuses on the dark side — if only he could get his campaign moving on the right track. At the same time, the data suggest that the optimism of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats risks sounding dissonant, if not elitist, in a country that is clearly apprehensive. The election may be moving in Clinton’s direction, but her current lead is not guaranteed to stand. Both campaigns are highly vulnerable to events — those that are intentionally orchestrated and those that appear out of nowhere.
