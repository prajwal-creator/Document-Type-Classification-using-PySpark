Osvaldo Fernandez and Livan Hernandez defected from the Cuban national team during the summer, but they did not take the routine route to professional baseball. Instead of seeking asylum in the United States, as other Cuban defectors had, Fernandez and Hernandez gained resident status in the Dominican Republic. That's where they are now, pitching in the Dominican Winter League, and that's why they are free agents, eligible to sign with any major league organization rather than having to submit to a special draft that would restrict their bargaining rights to one team. The new Cuban route to the major leagues was plotted by Joe Cubas, who is expected to produce lucrative contracts for his clients in the latter half of this month.

"The only thing I did was I went by the rules, by the law. I went by the book."  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Because previous defectors had come to the United States, the commissioner's  office ruled that they were residents of the country and therefore subject to the draft. In some cases, like pitcher Rene Arocha of St. Louis, a lottery was held among interested clubs; in others, like Rey Ordonez, a future Mets shortstop, a special draft was conducted. Last June, the Oakland Athletics selected pitcher Ariel Prieto in the regular amateur draft. But Fernandez and Hernandez, under Cubas's plan, did not become residents of  the United States. "The opportunity existed where a country like the Dominican was in a position to give us a visa to enter the country so these guys could come in and play baseball there," Cubas said. "Then we sought legal residency." Players from countries like the Dominican Republic or Venezuela or Australia  are not subject to a draft but are free to sign with anyone. Fernandez, who Cubas says is 27 but according to his birthdate in a 1992 scorecard is 29, left the Cuban national team on July 29 when it was playing a series of games in Millington, Tenn. He went directly to the Dominican Republic  and gained residency status. Hernandez, 20 years old, defected from the national team in Monterrey, Mexico, on Sept. 25 and traveled to the Dominican Republic by way of Venezuela. "Once the residencies were obtained," Cubas said, "we confronted the commissioner's office with our case and waited for a ruling."

"It was just a matter of making sure everyone had notice and a reasonable opportunity to observe them," Murray said yesterday, explaining the date. "It was as much for the players as for the clubs."

"Every time they pitch, the presence of all the ball clubs is there," Cubas said, "either their Dominican representatives or scouts or in some cases we have seen top executives." Attendance is expected to be high for their next starts, Hernandez on Friday  night, Fernandez on Saturday. The Yankees, Cubas said, are among the very interested. He said Fernandez and Hernandez had been scrutinized by Gordon Blakely, the coordinator of international scouting; Lin Garrett, the scouting director, and two or three others. Cubas said he planned to talk to every club that is interested. Cubas believes Fernandez and Hernandez are both ready to pitch in the major leagues, though he said that some scouts feel the younger pitcher is "a spring training away from pitching in the big leagues." One major league scout who has seen them pitch said Hernandez would benefit from a year in Class AAA but said he probably could pitch for some teams in the  majors next season. Cubas said he has two other players, also right-handed pitchers, in Venezuela and expected them to arrive in the Dominican Republic today. Vladimir Nunez, 20, and Larry Rodriguez, 21, left the Cuban B team in Venezuela in October. Rodriguez, he said, was rookie of the year in Cuba this year. "As soon as they reach the Dominican," the agent said, "our intention is to obtain legal status as soon as possible, then follow the same route in petitioning the commissioner's office and getting them free-agent status. We feel the precedent is there."    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
