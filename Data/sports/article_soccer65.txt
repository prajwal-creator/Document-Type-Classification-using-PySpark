A career is born in Catalonia. Isaac Cuenca, age 20 but until recently barely on the radar of Spanish league soccer, played on the wing and scored an impressive goal in Barcelona ’s 5-0 rout of Levante at Camp Nou on Saturday. A career is reclaimed in England. Yakubu Aiyegbeni, a traveler whose path has led from Nigeria to Portugal to Israel and to England, came back to form after a yearlong struggle following Achilles heel surgery — and on Saturday, Yakubu scored four times in the Blackburn Rovers’ 4-2 victory over Swansea City in the Premier League . Welcome home, Cuenca, a Catalan boy now in the company of the world’s greatest soccer team. “Feed the Yak, and he will score,” chanted Blackburn fans applauding their team’s second win in a desperate season.

He enrolled in Barcelona’s famed academy, La Masia, in 2003 — a slight but evidently gifted boy typical of the club’s intake.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       But how does a lad blossom in the kindergarten of so many acclaimed rising stars? Where does he find opportunities when the nucleus of the Spanish World Cup-winning side is growing up there, and when supertalents like Ronaldinho and then Lionel Messi arrive? Halfway through his third year at La Masia, Cuenca dropped out. He went home to Tarragona, to find his game with the local team, Reus. Barcelona never gave up on him. After a spell with C.F. Damm, he returned to the junior teams at Camp Nou but was loaned to Sabadell, which he helped lift from the third to the second division. The head coach, Pep Guardiola, however, had not forgotten the budding winger. Cuenca had not figured in the Barça B team while Guardiola ran it, but as the coach did with Pedro, whom he called into the first team squad two seasons ago, the now head coach invited Cuenca to preseason camp last summer. Guardiola, himself a former child of La Masia and a stalwart of Johan  Cruyff’s time in charge of Barça, appreciates that not every boy develops to display his skills at the same stage. The mental toughness to perform on a team expected to win, and to entertain, every time it plays can take years to harden. By October of this year, after a few runs with the B team, Cuenca made his senior debut. He replaced David Villa in the last moments of a Champions League home win over Viktoria Plzen. Guardiola liked what he saw. As important, Barcelona’s renowned big-name players accepted Cuenca as being on their level. He played the full 90 minutes of an away game at Granada in October, and scored against Mallorca four days later.

Coming in from the left, but using his right foot, Cuenca caressed the ball, curling it low inside the far post.

Coach Guardiola wouldn’t ask a novice to play there — or would he? Meantime, though Yakubu officially turned 29 years of age last month, his comeback has the feeling of reclamation. Yakubu was 17, and already playing abroad, when he played for Nigeria at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000. He was, even then, a strapping youth with an apparent knack for finding the net with nonchalance. His travels had already begun. Pini Zahavi, an agent with a rare eye for pedigree, persuaded Israel’s leading club, Maccabi Haifa, to invest $300,000 in him. Haifa loaned him out to Hapoel Kfar Saba and, in turn, he seemed on the cusp of a move to Dynamo Kiev in Ukraine. That did not happen, so he resettled in Haifa, scoring goals that helped the team to successive Israel league titles. Along the way, Yakubu scored a Champions League hat trick against Olympiakos, and a penalty against Manchester United. With Zahavi’s contacts, a move to England was in the cards. Yakubu trained for a time with Derby County, but difficulty getting a work permit closed that door. Portsmouth, an English team with Russian and Israeli involvement in the boardroom, managed the work permit, and after half a season on loan, Yakubu proved he could score in England’s Premier League. Portsmouth paid a reported £4 million, or $6.2 million, for him, and his goals kept Pompey in the top division. But Portsmouth’s Russian ownership was opaque and short-lived. Yakubu was sold to Middlesbrough, another team that overreached itself. The price was said to be £7 million, but an official enquiry into dubious soccer transfers and questionable agents’ fees in England never got to the bottom of the Yukubu transfers. Middlesbrough had a glorious run to the UEFA Cup final, but lost to Sevilla. It lost its Premier League status, and lost Yakubu to Everton. That was where the chant “Feed the Yak and he will score” began. The fans loved his goals, and gently taunted his robust-to-the-point-of-heavy build. Everton’s manager, David Moyes, worked overtime to try to motivate the Yak, became exasperated when Yakubu returned to the team late after an African Nations Cup one January, and let him go after the long recovery from the Achilles’ tendon he ruptured at the end of November 2010.

But Saturday, becoming only the fifth player to score hat tricks for three different teams in the Premier League, he was irrepressible. Yabuku scored with a left-foot volley; twice with his head; and, the fourth time, from the penalty spot with his right foot. He may not be the most mobile striker in the league, but he remains a born predator. The first words he said on television after his quadruple were, “I am grateful to Blackburn for giving me the chance to come here and to play every week.”   A version of this article appears in print on December 5, 2011, in The International Herald Tribune.
