HONAN MAY 6, 2001     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           IN a recent student production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' here, the two lovers had to compete for audience attention with Asian drums, a police siren, a hit parade of oldies and a Shakespearean character (Mercutio) who kept reappearing after he was stabbed to death. It was a deconstructed version of Shakespeare's tragedy, directed by Kit McKay, a student from Indianapolis, and the only thing that wasn't surprising about it was that the play was presented at Sarah Lawrence College -- one of the most liberal and resolutely experimental colleges in the United States. Sarah Lawrence has among the lowest student-teacher ratios in the nation -- 6 to 1. Grades are virtually nonexistent, and there are few course requirements. A recent visitor to the school's 40-acre campus here just over the border from Bronxville gathered much evidence of the sort that prompted the editors of the current Fiske Guide to Colleges to declare, ''The students and faculty at Sarah Lawrence College believe that there aren't any rules, and if they do exist they are made to be broken.''

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       But something else has lingered too -- a serious shortage of money. Sarah Lawrence has been strapped for cash ever since its founding in 1926 by William Van Duzer Lawrence (he named the school after his wife, Sarah). Mr. Lawrence, who made a fortune in patent medicines and real estate, died a year later -- before he had substantially endowed the school. Henry Noble MacCracken, then president of Vassar, saw Sarah Lawrence as a potential feeder of students to Vassar and came to its rescue by raising enough money to get the college on its feet by 1928. But money continued to be hard to come by. Today, the school rests uneasily on an endowment of only $46.4 million. That sounds like a lot, but is small change compared with competitors like Williams ($1.3 billion) and Swarthmore ($963 million). Sarah Lawrence ranked 410th on a list of college and university endowments for the year 2000 compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education, behind many less prestigious colleges, and even behind many public universities. The low endowment means that Sarah Lawrence is ''outgunned by a factor of 2 or 5 or even 10 by other small liberal arts colleges, and may lose students and faculty for that reason,'' said David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. It also means that Sarah Lawrence must charge the highest tuition and fees of any college in New York State -- $26,668 -- and the second highest in the nation, after Landmark College in Putney, Vt., which serves students with learning disabilities and charges $30,000, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. Room and board at Sarah Lawrence is an additional $8,460. If the college is to preserve its cherished student-faculty ratio, keep faculty salaries competitive, maintain its physical plant, provide financial aid to needy students and meet the costs of the latest information-age electronics, the endowment must grow.

(Since women tend to earn less than men, professional fund-raisers recognize them as poor donors compared with men.) But Michele Tolela Myers, a specialist in communications who became president of Sarah Lawrence in 1998, is undaunted. During her nine years as president of Denison University in Ohio, she helped increase that school's endowment to $275 million, from $75 million. ''Women give generously when properly motivated,'' she said. ''Men are quite happy to make unrestricted gifts. They don't care if you use the money to repair a leak in the roof. Women, on the other hand, want to make designated gifts. Only a few days ago, we received a gift of $250,000 from a woman who wanted to help us build a greenhouse -- which we need. ''Beyond that, I'm very passionate and I raise money well,'' said Dr. Myers, who speaks with the trace of a French accent. (She was born in Morocco and educated in Paris.) ''I go to people who have benefited from their education here and I tell them that I don't believe in mass education. I don't believe in mass lectures. I believe that the close encounter at Sarah Lawrence between students and faculty is the best way to educate. Sarah Lawrence is one of the last bastions in a world gone crazy. ''People believe that if something doesn't make money it isn't important. Something is not right about that.'' But Dr. Myers recognizes that the college's small endowment poses serious competitive challenges. It is one reason for the high tuition, she said, along with the low student-faculty ratio, ''which means we must support greater number of faculty members with tuition dollars from fewer students.'' A major concern, she said, ''is the gap between the colleges that are getting wealthier and wealthier, building huge endowments, and colleges like ours that have no such resources.'' ''My worry is what happens to the institutions that are less wealthy. They can lose faculty and they can lose students.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   To prevent such losses, Dr. Myers said, she raised faculty salaries by 10 percent two years ago. That meant that an average faculty salary of a little more than $60,000 climbed to $66,358, though Sarah Lawrence still pays its professors less than many local institutions, including Westchester Community College and Pace University. Nonetheless, it helped. Barbara Kaplan, dean of the faculty, said, ''It has made faculty recruitment a lot easier.'' Sarah Lawrence's other principal shortage is men. Unlike Vassar College to the north in Poughkeepsie, which went co-ed at about the same time, Sarah Lawrence has not attracted anything close to a 50-50 mix of men and women. At Vassar, for example, about 40 percent of students are men. At Sarah Lawrence, only 26 percent are men. With a student body of only 1,010 undergraduates, the disparity (264 men to 746 women) is unmistakable on a sunny spring day. ''Ideally, I'd like us to be 40 percent men like Vassar,'' Dr. Myers said, ''but it isn't a big issue.'' Mr. Warren, of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, agreed. ''If the school had a male component that was rapidly dropping, there would be cause for concern,'' he said. ''But they don't have that. They figure the school has been going along with this percent of men and that seems to be working. Look, if Dr. Myers wanted to start a football team it would give them another 100 men just like that. But that's not what Sarah Lawrence is about.'' Even so, Thyra Briggs, the dean of admissions, acknowledged that her office is making special efforts to increase the number of men. ''Men are given a second look before being turned down,'' she said. She added that she recently discovered that men outnumbered women in film history and film direction courses, and therefore her office has begun promoting those courses to attract more men.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   One thing that may be turning away male applicants is the small number of science courses and the absence of a rough-and-tumble program of athletics -- programs that young men traditionally look for. Sarah Lawrence is known for its devotion to the arts -- dance, theater, music, and film and the visual arts.

Pollak, the school's director of communications who also supervises marketing, said: ''We are who we are, and we don't want to change that in an effort to attract students. On the other hand, it's my job to make sure that our message gets out there so that students are aware of us as a possible choice.'' To more vigorously sell the school's special qualities, Ms. Pollak recently established a marketing committee composed of writers, designers and a public relations staff member ''so that everybody knows what everybody else is doing.'' One of the things the group did recently was to redesign a student recruiting brochure to better reflect the liberal approach of the school. ''Instead of showing off just the beauty of the campus, which is what the earlier brochure did, we focused on people,'' Ms. Pollak said. ''And we wanted to show them honestly, maybe a little grittier and funkier than in the past. We also let students do a lot of the writing, help select photographs and do the design work. The students loved it.'' Ms. Pollak also observed that today it is more difficult than in the past to know what will appeal to men as opposed to women. ''Students today take a broader view of things, not the same old stereotypes,'' she said. ''They cross over different boundaries.'' Sarah Samp, 19, from Carlsbad, N.M., and chairwoman of the Student Senate, said that there are enough men on campus so that ''the male voice'' had been present in all her classes. ''I might have been concerned if that had not been the case,'' she said. Vikram Mathew, 23, a senior from Bronxville, said that while he had been respectful of women before he arrived on campus, finding himself in a society where women greatly outnumbered men has made him even more considerate.

I've been fine-tuned on this issue.'' Sarah Lawrence remains a predominantly white institution. In 1997, the student body was 82.1 percent white, 6.1 percent black, 4.3 percent Hispanic and 5.8 percent Asian. Foreign enrollment was less than 1 percent. Sarah Lawrence's yield, or percent of accepted students who actually enroll, is 31 percent -- not bad compared with competitors like Mount Holyoke (39 percent), Oberlin (30 percent), Bard (28 percent) and Reed (24 percent). Ms. Briggs added that the college would like to recruit more local students, and with that in mind recently established a scholarship for Yonkers residents. ''But it's a struggle to convince kids to go to a college in their backyards,'' she said. While Sarah Lawrence prides itself on its unconventional approach, Dr. Myers rejects descriptions of the college as a place where anything goes. ''There are some rules,'' she said, leaning forward at a conference table in her spacious, book-lined office. ''There are rules here on how you treat people and how you treat ideas. You treat both with great respect. ''I prefer to describe Sarah Lawrence as an intellectual and artistic hothouse where people are passionate about being curious and thinking out of the box. The ethos here is that it's cool to care about your work. It's no sin to go to the library.'' For all that, the number of shattered rules here is impressive. To wit: grades are all but absent. Professors file them (together with written evaluations to monitor student progress) with the college registrar in case a student applies to a graduate program -- like medical school -- that requires them. Nevertheless, students say, they rarely trouble to look up their grades.

The same with required courses. Apart from one mandatory freshman course designed to teach how to approach college-level work, and courses that may be prescribed by graduate schools, there is no academic forced-feeding here. Instead, the college has divided the world of knowledge into four categories -- natural science and math, social sciences, humanities and the creative and performing arts. Students must select courses from three of the four areas. And while interdisciplinary study is emphasized on almost every campus these days, at Sarah Lawrence courses are organized to crisscross traditional academic boundaries and become part of an individually tailored academic program developed by the student in partnership with a don, or faculty adviser, who remains with the student for his or her entire time at the college. Many colleges and universities demand that every student take a one-semester course commonly known as Freshman Comp, which is supposed to promote literacy. Sarah Lawrence will have none of it. Writing, the school believes, is too important to be left to teaching assistants in the English Department. Instead, there is a heavy component of writing in every course the college offers. All year long, in every program of study, Sarah Lawrence students produce papers, essays, stories, scripts, poems and plays, and rigorously correct and rewrite when necessary. The writing program, arguably the best in the country, was honored last year by the editors of Time magazine and the Princeton Review when they selected Sarah Lawrence as ''Liberal Arts College of the Year.'' Mr. Warren also finds much to praise. ''Despite being under-resourced, Sarah Lawrence is an exceedingly high performance school,'' he said. ''It has going for it a student-to-faculty ratio of 6 to 1, and there isn't another school in the 1,000 we represent that does as well. The closest are Amherst and Swarthmore, both of which have an 8 to 1 ratio. Most others have a 10 or 12 to 1 ratio.''

Lisa Pryne, 21, a senior from Seattle who is president of the senior class, thinks the system is great. She said her personal relationships with her professors is ''the best thing here.'' Finally, there is a strong sense of daring in all of the above. When other colleges and universities showed little interest in subjects like black studies, women's history, early childhood development, AIDS prevention and research, and continuing education for adults, Sarah Lawrence was storming those intellectual barricades. It was not always undertaken with grim determination. In 1998, Sarah Lawrence was host to the first intercollegiate slam, or competitive poetry performance. New York University defeated Bard and Sarah Lawrence, but, according to participants, no one had more fun than the home team.
