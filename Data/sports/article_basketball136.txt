Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies . ★ ‘Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry’ (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis) ‘Arbitrage’ (R, 1:40) Richard Gere plays a New York hedge-fund magnate whose glittering world may be coming undone in Nicholas Jarecki’s sleek entertainment about how very good greed can be. A fairy tale masquerading as a tragedy, the film features Susan Sarandon as the wife and Brit Marling as the doting daughter. (Dargis) ★ ‘Argo’ (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Atlas Shrugged, Part II’ (PG-13, 1:52) He isn’t the only one. The producers of this and “Part I” will have to work harder if they want anyone, other than Ayn Rand loyalists, to stick around for the presumptive third movie so they learn who this John Galt cat is. (Dargis)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       ★ ‘The Big Picture’ (No rating, 1:54, in French, Serbian, Montenegrin and English) The adage, “It’s never too late to be who you might have been,” ascribed to George Eliot, is given a cruel twist in this terrific French thriller. A loose adaptation of Douglas Kennedy’s 1997 novel, it might be described as “The Talented Mr. Ripley” for the age of Google. (Stephen Holden) ★ ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ (PG-13, 2:44) After seven years and two films that have pushed Batman (Christian Bale) ever deeper into the dark, the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern, post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. (Dargis) ‘Detropia’ (No rating, 1:33) A visual caress of postindustrial blight, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady’s dreamy documentary about a slowly crumbling Detroit places information and analysis distant seconds to mood and impression. (Jeannette Catsoulis) ‘Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel’ (PG-13, 1:26) A dizzily enjoyable documentary from Lisa Immordino Vreeland about Diana Vreeland, the famous fashion editor and paradigmatic self-made woman who had a genius for the inspirational, the gnomic and the quotable. (Dargis) ‘Dredd 3D’ (R, 1:35) Alex Garland wrote and Pete Travis directed this grim, gory adaptation of the British comic series. The setting is a neo-wild West in which the gizmos look futuristic, but everything else is B-movie familiar. Karl Urban stars. (Dargis) ‘End of Watch’ (R, 1:49) David Ayer’s ode to beat cops and the expansive literature on them is a muscular, maddening exploitation movie embellished with art-house style and anchored by solid performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. (Dargis) ‘Frankenweenie’ (PG, 1:27) This cute and creepy animated update of the Frankenstein story, from the imagination of Tim Burton, pays tribute to monster movies of the past while honoring the commercial family-movie imperatives of the present. (A. O. Scott)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Gayby’ (No rating, 1:29) A gay man and his best gal pal decide to have a baby the old-fashioned way in Jonathan Lisecki’s baggy comedy. The movie doesn’t have much to say about the topics at hand: love and friendship, and how unconventional modern permutations might help rewrite the script of romance. (Rachel Saltz) ‘Harvest of Empire’ (No rating, 1:30, in English and Spanish) This fact-filled documentary works as a civics lesson and has a punch that comes from political advocacy. Directed by Peter Getzels and Eduardo López, it has two clear missions: to combat anti-immigrant feeling and to show how migration from Latin America has been spurred by the sometimes violent intervention of the United States. (Saltz) ‘Here Comes the Boom’ (PG, 1:44) This is a pleasant enough comedy if you can buy the premise that Kevin James would make a credible mixed martial arts fighter. Here he’s a teacher determined to raise money to save the music program, and he takes up the sport for the purses it offers. Mr. James and Henry Winkler, playing a fellow teacher, pair surprisingly well in the predictable tale. (Neil Genzlinger) ★ ‘Holy Motors’ (No rating, 1:56, in English and French) The French filmmaker Leos Carax opens the door to a world full of laughter, horror and rapture, reminding you of just how drearily conventional many movies are. A mystery man (Denis Lavant) moves, walks, leaps and rides through Paris in a series of strange adventures in a dream of the movies that looks like a movie of dreams. (Dargis) ‘Hotel Transylvania’ (PG, 1:31) This animated film, essentially “The Little Mermaid” with monsters, looks great, though the story grows less interesting as the movie progresses. Dracula keeps his teenage (well, she’s 118) daughter in a hotel that’s exclusively for monsters to protect her from those nasty humans, but she wants to experience the world. A wayward hiker dude only reinforces that determination. Some good monster-related humor early on before the predictable plot takes over. (Genzlinger) ‘The House I Live In’ (No rating, 1:48) In his latest documentary, Eugene Jarecki, inspired by an African-American family employee, digs deep into the drug war and its racial and class implications. The result is a call to national conscience, and persuasively urgent. (Dargis) ‘House at the End of the Street’ (PG-13, 1:41) This blatant unscary rip-off of “Psycho” is an incoherent hybrid of the Hitchcock classic and standard teenage horror films. (Holden) ★ ‘How to Survive a Plague’ (No rating, 1:50) The currents of rage, fear, fiery determination and, finally, triumph that crackle through David France’s inspiring documentary lend this history of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or Act Up, a scorching electrical charge. (Holden)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘The Intouchables’ (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (François Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film’s unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences — the movie was a huge hit in France — but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It’s embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott) ‘The Iran Job’ (No rating, 1:30) Iran in 2008 isn’t a place where every American would feel comfortable. But the effusive basketball player Kevin Sheppard takes to it with informal ease in this documentary, observational and authentic if not always artful. Sports fans are fed, but so are the culturally curious: most interesting and revealing are three lively Iranian women he befriends. (David DeWitt) ‘Just 45 Minutes From Broadway’ (No rating, 1:46) This reverent sendup, from the prolific Henry Jaglom, borders on farce (but not enough) when dropping in on a family of actors who can’t turn off their performing in life, for better or worse — though the better is sometimes hard to imagine with this crew of hams. Most of the performers do fine work, given the muddy genre, but the film’s crop of clichés is dispiriting, in result if not intent. (DeWitt) ‘Looper’ (R, 1:58) Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a killer and Bruce Willis plays an older version of the same in Rian Johnson’s obstreperously entertaining science-fiction pastiche set in a futuristic world that sometimes looks and sounds paradoxically out of the past. (Dargis) ★ ‘The Master’ (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her journey is hard, as well as politically freighted, but also more complex than it might initially seem. (Dargis) ★ ‘Moonrise Kingdom’ (PG-13, 1:34) In Wes Anderson’s latest, a wondrous storybook tale, a girl and a boy, both 12, run off to a remote inlet on an island where most of the adults seem disappointed and more than a little sad. The two are very serious — about love, their plans, books, life itself — and often act older than their age. You wonder what their hurry is, given that here adulthood, with its quarrels, regrets and anguished pillow talk, can feel as dangerous as the storm that’s hurtling toward the island, ready to blow it all down. With Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand. (Dargis) ‘The Oranges’ (R, 1:30) The best explanation for this dud that wastes the talents of Hugh Laurie, Oliver Platt, Allison Janney and Catherine Keener may be that its creators couldn’t decide whether it should be a dangerous comic satire or a serious dramatic downer, and settled for a wishy-washy middle ground. (Holden) ‘The Paperboy’ (R, 1:46) In the hands of Lee Daniels ( “Precious” ), Pete Dexter’s Southern potboiler becomes a hot mess of pulpy passion, utterly incoherent but crazily alive. With Nicole Kidman, Matthew McConaughey and Zac Efron in his underpants. (Scott)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘The Perks of Being a Wallflower’ (PG-13, 1:43) Stephen Chbosky directs this adaptation of his 1999 young adult novel about the ups, downs and playlists of an introverted high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who’s rescued by the friendships he makes. (Dargis) ‘Photographic Memory’ (No rating, 1:27, in English and French) How accurate is your memory as you get on in years? How much do old home movies and vintage photographs reveal about the past? Such questions go to the heart of Ross McElwee’s Proustian documentary about a period of his youth spent in France. (Holden) ‘Pitch Perfect’ (PG-13, 1:52) This comedy about a female collegiate a cappella group feels as if it’s aimed at tweeners, which is too bad because that saddles it with dopey plot elements — daddy issues, boyfriend issues — that prevent a more substantive look at this rich genre of music. A few of the songs, though, rock. (Genzlinger) ‘The Possession’ (PG-13, 1:32) Perched somewhere between “The Exorcist” and “The Unborn,” this eerily enjoyable tale from the Danish director Ole Bornedal gives a malevolent box to a troubled young girl, throws in the Hasidic rap artist Matisyahu, and stands back. (Catsoulis) ‘Resident Evil: Retribution’ (R, 1:35) Taking place almost entirely inside airless, computer-simulated locations, this fifth entry in the series finds its caffeinated heroine (Milla Jovovich) still battling zombies, still wearing bondage gear, only now with a daughter — shamelessly cribbing from “Aliens” — and an alternate suburban reality to protect. (Catsoulis) ‘Samsara’ (PG-13, 1:39) Ron Fricke’s new film, like its predecessor, “Baraka,” is a free-associative tour of the world, a series of striking, sometimes surreal images of nature, work, life and death in the global economy. (Scott) ★ ‘Searching for Sugar Man’ (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul’s hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don’t wait for the DVD. (Dargis) ‘Seven Psychopaths’ (R, 1:49) A sporadically funny, blood-splattered comedy from the playwright turned movie director Martin McDonagh about a Los Angeles screenwriter (Colin Farrell), his writer’s block and his circle of dangerous acquaintances (Christopher Walken, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson). (Dargis)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Sinister” (R, 1:50) Ethan Hawke tries to class up this movie, directed by Scott Derrickson, about a true-crime writer who moves his family into the house once occupied by the same slaughtered family he’s writing about. Bad things happen. (Dargis) ‘Sleepwalk With Me’ (No rating, 1:30) The surreal dream sequences in this screen adaptation of Mike Birbiglia’s 2008 one-man show — about a commitment-phobic stand-up comedian with a sleep disorder — help make this likable movie more than a glorified stand-up act. (Holden) ★ ‘Smashed’ (R, 1:20) The degree to which this story of alcoholism and recovery refuses to indulge a voyeuristic taste for the kind of sordid details exploited by reality television amounts to an unspoken declaration of principle. In lieu of self-pity, “Smashed” substitutes tough love. (Holden) ‘Ted’ (R, 1:46) Seth MacFarlane, creator of “The Family Guy,” takes his provocative humor and his New England-accented voice-over skills to the big screen in this profane, sometimes funny comedy about a talking stuffed animal, the overgrown boy who loves him (Mark Wahlberg) and, somewhat tangentially, the boy’s girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who wishes he would just grow up. (Scott) ‘Trouble With the Curve’ (PG-13, 1:51) The latest of Clint Eastwood’s grumpy old men is Gus Lobel, a Major League Baseball scout struggling with failing eyesight and a front office full of number-crunching “Moneyball” types. On a trip to North Carolina to check out a promising young slugger, Gus and his semi-estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), do some squabbling and some healing. Mickey, a big-city lawyer, also dabbles in romance with a rival (and former protégé) of her dad’s played by Justin Timberlake. The movie, directed by Mr. Eastwood’s protégé Robert Lorenz, is hokey and predictable — the very title is a spoiler — but it is also full of warmth, humor and wonderful performances. (Scott) ‘V/H/S’ (R, 1:55) Populated by drunks, louts and Grade-A molesters, this low-budget horror anthology flits from ghastly to moronic in displays of braying masculinity that can be, at least for women, a chore to listen to and a torment to watch. (Catsoulis) ‘War of the Buttons’ (PG-13, 1:40, in French) Christophe Barratier has set his version of this story — about boys in a territorial war that grows increasingly fraught — in occupied France in 1944. That inflates the stakes, but this slick movie too often rings false when it tries to compare the boys’ war with the deadly serious adult one. (Saltz) ‘Won’t Back Down’ (PG, 2:00) Two moms, Viola Davis and Maggie Gyllenhaal, team up to fight a teachers’ union in the name of “the kids.” This exercise in educational-reform propaganda, directed by Daniel Barnz, is somewhat amusing in the way it turns the traditional strike drama on its head, but it is so strident and tone-deaf that even those who sympathize with its anti-labor views — to say nothing of the union members who make up the cast — may find themselves embarrassed. (Scott)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Wuthering Heights’ (No rating, 2:08) Andrea Arnold strips away the veneer of polish and romanticism to produce a wild and raw version of Emily Brontë’s novel of ill-starred passion. The film, the first with black actors playing Heathcliff, aims for maximum intensity, but its naturalism feels as mannered in its way as the stately decorum of older adaptations. (Scott) Film Series On Romantics and Outsiders: the Cinema of Yousry Nasrallah (Friday through Wednesday) With the death of the incomparable Youssef Chahine in 2008, the position of Egypt’s foremost filmmaker passed in due line of succession to Yousry Nasrallah, Chahine’s former assistant and screenwriter. Like Chahine, though with less melodramatic fervor, Mr. Nasrallah turns the broad strokes and high emotions of the popular Egyptian cinema to acute social observation, and the conflicts within his films, six of which will be shown in this series, embody the tensions of class, gender and religion (Mr. Nasrallah is of a Coptic Christian background) that animate his ever-evolving country. The films here range from his 1988 debut, “Summer Thefts” (Monday at 9 p.m. and Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.), the story of a cross-cultural friendship that ranges from the land reforms of the 1960s to the Iran-Iraq war, to the 2008 film “The Aquarium” (Tuesday and Wednesday at 9 p.m.). Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org ; $10. (Dave Kehr) Salut les jeunes! Young French Cinema (Friday through Thursday) Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, ACID is an association of French filmmakers that supports the distribution of independent films, most conspicuously through an annual program in Cannes. This selection of recent films supported by ACID includes Sophie Letourneur’s 2010 debut, “La Vie au Ranch,” a semi-autobiographical story of a group of young women who share a Left Bank apartment (Friday at 2 and 6:50 p.m.); Armel Hostiou’s “Day,” a 2011 film that follows three characters through a single day in Paris (Monday at 6:50 p.m.); and “Robert Mitchum Is Dead” (Wednesday at 6:50 p.m.), a road movie by Olivier Babinet and Fred Kihn about an agent (Oliver Gourmet) and an actor (Pablo Nicomedes) trying to make their way to a film festival in the Arctic Circle. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org ; $12.
