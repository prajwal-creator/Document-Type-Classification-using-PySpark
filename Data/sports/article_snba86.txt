Other applicants sent in laudatory letters from high school teachers and coaches who vouched for their head-of-the-class qualifications. But Alexi Indris-Santana's file contained only a note from the Lazy T Ranch in Utah, saying he had ridden with the best of them. Also in the folder were a few newspaper clippings about track meets he had won, and his own smoothly worded essay about why he wanted to attend an Ivy League school. On campus after campus, puzzled admissions officers wondered how someone who claimed not to have set foot in a schoolroom since kindergarten could have scored 730 on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test and 680 on the math -- far above the national average. But skeptics, if there were any, put aside their doubts. One Brown University administrator recalls that the dean of admissions "sat there with the file in his hand and said, 'There's something wrong with this file. I can't put my finger on it, so I guess we ought to take him.' " Princeton also accepted Mr. Indris-Santana and offered substantial financial aid to help him meet its $20,000-a-year costs. Yale turned him down, as did Harvard.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Once enrolled -- after a summertime stint with the grounds crew tending Princeton's football field -- Mr. Indris-Santana projected the Princeton image. Last month he went through bicker, Princeton's interview-and-blackball process, and won a place at Ivy Club, the campus haunt of such well-known Princetonians as James A. Baker 3d and various Rockefellers and Duponts. Mr. Indris-Santana seemed so unflappable that hardly any of his classmates asked about apparent discrepancies in the stories he told about himself. He told some students that he was an orphan, others that his mother was dying. Indeed, if someone from his past had not called Princeton, suggesting that Mr. Indris-Santana was not what he advertised, he might still be one of Princeton's best hope for victory in next year's distance races. meets. But Princeton concluded last week that it had been fooled, and the student known as Mr. Indris-Santana was arrested on a fugitive warrant from Utah, where officials said he had served time in prison. The fine points of the story remain sketchy, but the police in Princeton say he admitted that he was the man named in the Utah warrant, James A. Hogue, who was wanted for violating parole. To Princeton's chagrin, the Lazy T Ranch seems to not exist. "There's no Lazy T Ranch in Park City," said Terry Orr, the editor of the local newspaper, The Park Record, in Park City, Utah. "We are aski resort."  Different Places, Different Names It also turned out that Mr. Hogue, now 31, had posed as other people at least twice before, in California and Colorado, and had attended at least two colleges under his real name. Mr. Hogue grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Kansas City, Kan., where neighbors described his father as a retired railroad worker. Mr. Hogue's parents refused requests for interviews, as did Mr. Hogue. But it is possible to piece together something of his life before he left home. The principal at Washington High School, John Burke, said that Mr. Hogue graduated in 1977. "He was an A and B student," Mr. Burke said. In athletics, Mr. Burke said, Mr. Hogue was a star runner.

As a sophomore, said Steve Weakland, the assistant director of sports information, Mr. Hogue ran in an N.C.A.A. regional meet at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, finishing 226th in a field of 250 competitors in the 10,000-meter race. Mr. Hogue left the school after that, without graduating. College, High School And College Again He registered at the University of Texas in the early 1980's, but did not earn a degree. The next time Mr. Hogue is known to have registered for a class was not at a college but at Palo Alto High School in California in 1985. "The story was he originally tried to go over and enroll in Stanford University, just across the street," said James Schroyer, who was the principal at the time. "Somebody there said if you haven't graduated from high school, you have to do that first, so he ends up at the high school." Mr. Schroyer said last week that he had misgivings about the new student, who had enrolled under the name Jay Huntsman. "I think my initial reaction was, 'Are you sure you're not a little bit older than 17?' " Mr. Schroyer said. Mr. Huntsman, Mr. Schroyer said, claimed to have been born in Los Angeles and to have lost both parents in an automobile accident. But a Palo Alto police officer who did community-relations duty at the school checked with the police in Los Angeles, and cast doubt on the story. "He said there was a Jay Huntsman, but it was a baby that died early," Mr. Schroyer said. By the time the report came back from Los Angeles, Mr. Schroyer said, Mr. Huntsman had impressed the athletic coaches with his speed and endurance as a runner. Competing against students who were actually seven or eight years his junior, Mr. Huntsman won the high school division of the Stanford invitational cross-country meet in 1985. But almost as quickly as he appeared at the school, Mr. Huntsman dropped out, Mr. Schroyer said, after the police got word from Los Angeles and questioned him about his background. A few months later, he was arrested on a check-forgery charge. After that charge was dropped, he left Palo Alto, but took with him a new title. He turned up in Colorado, saying he had a doctorate from Stanford and was on the faculty there. He got a job with a sports cross-training camp in Vail, joining such world-class athletes as Frank Shorter, the Olympic marathoner.

"He said, 'James Hogue is a fraud, his antics have to stop, he's been doing this for a number of years, he should be stopped,' " Mr. Davis said. Mr. Davis said he called Stanford and was told that there was no James Hogue on the faculty. He then confronted his running-class instructor.

It was like, 'Hey, I got busted, I'll go somewhere else and scam them.' " Mr. Davis said Mr. Hogue headed for Aspen, Colo., and began inventing the role that he played in the Ivy League, taking his new first name from Alexi Grewal, an Olympic cyclist. Stolen Bike Frames Lead to Prison Term At about the same time, Mr. Hogue was involved in the incident that eventually led to his unmasking in Princeton. Dave Tesch, a California bicycle-builder who also worked at Mr. Davis's camp, reported the theft of about $20,000 worth of bike frames and tools from his shop. Mr. Hogue, who had stayed with Mr. Tesch until shortly before the break-in, was questioned by the police but was not charged, Mr. Tesch said last week. More than a year later, a cyclist in St. George, Utah, noticed that Mr. Hogue -- working as a bicycle mechanic -- had a wrench engraved with Mr. Tesch's name. The cyclist called Mr. Tesch, who notified the police. Detective Matt Jacobson of the St. George police arrested Mr. Hogue for possession of stolen property -- the tools and several Tesch bike frames. He was convicted and sentenced to up to five years in prison. Utah officials said he was paroled in March 1989 after serving 10 months, and last checked in with parole officers in August 1989. After he missed a appointment, they issued the warrant on which he was arrested last week in Princeton. The connection to Princeton turned up in the storage locker Mr. Hogue had rented in St. George -- where he kept Mr. Tesch's tools and the bike frames. In one corner, Detective Jacobson found resumes and copies of letters to Ivy League schools, all in the name of Alexi Indris-Santana. The detective said he did not call the schools because he had no reason to suspect that any laws had been broken in connection with the applications. Princeton had accepted Mr. Indris-Santana despite what he said was his lack of a high school transcript or diploma. Fred Hargadon, Princeton's dean of admissions, said the applicant submitted a reading list as evidence of his qualifications. The list, on which he was questioned during an admissions interview, was heavy on science and history and was "very impressive," Dean Hargadon said. Anthony Cummings, who had Dean Hargadon's job at the time, declined to comment on what led Princeton to its decision. Princeton had high hopes for the unconventional newcomer when he arrived in the fall of 1989. The track coach, Lawrence T. Ellis, said he believed that Mr. Indris-Santana could develop into the best two-miler that Princeton ever had. But before Mr. Indris-Santana arrived on campus, he injured a tendon. That slowed him down, and he never quite lived up to the coach's expectations.

"We joked that if you're self-educated, you don't have to," said Justin Jacobs, a 19-year-old sophomore from Amherst, N.H. Nor did he appear to study much. Donna Riley, who was in a science class with him, said, "He psyched everyone out by saying that he never studied for tests and then he would do really well." Finally Recognized At a Track Meet Apparently, he did. Although the university would not release his academic transcript, some classmates said he racked up A's in science courses. Princeton learned of Mr. Indris-Santana's real identity last week after a Yale student from Palo Alto recognized him at an Ivy League track meet and called the high school track coach in Palo Alto. Jason Cole, a reporter at the Peninsula Times-Tribune in Palo Alto who had written about Mr. Huntsman, heard that he was attending Princeton and called the university. The next day, the Princeton police called Mr. Indris-Santana out of a geology class and arrested him on the fugitive warrant. He is being held in the Mercer County Detention Center in Trenton while prosecutors consider whether to extradite him to Utah or bring fraud charges against him under New Jersey law. Since his arrest, Princetonians have been been wondering about the student they thought they knew. Harvey Yavener, a sports reporter for The Times of Trenton who wrote a glowing profile of him in 1989, recalled having problems following Mr. Indris-Santana's unusual life story. ""I thought there was something here that didn't jibe," Mr. Yavener said last week. "I couldn't figure it out, though. I was saying to myself that this guy is too good to be real."
