He is about to premiere his treasured new work on Broadway, the musical-theater capital of the country. And after a long career of trying to figure out what he  wants to do with his life, he has chosen to set his music to a story about a football player who is trying to find himself. At a recent rehearsal, Reid walked among the singers and production staff of  his new football opera, "Different Fields," like a Gulliver among the Lilliputians. Reid has slimmed down from his 255-pound playing weight, but at 6  feet 3 inches he still has the bull neck and massive thighs of a National Football League defensive tackle. An all-American, Reid co-captained Penn State's undefeated 1968 and 1969 teams, and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988. He went  on to become an All-Pro pass rusher with the Cincinnati Bengals. "Different Fields," which he conceived and scored with lyrics by Sarah Schlesinger, was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera Guild and Opera Memphis of Tennessee. It  will begin a two-week run Wednesday at the New Victory Theater on 42d Street. Apart from his battered knees, Reid is a healthy-looking 48-year-old man with a dry sense of humor and a tendency to quote famous writers. Although he concedes that "Different Fields" -- which was written for children as well as adults -- uses football to make opera more appealing, he is worried that people  won't take it seriously.

"It's unbearable to me to have it treated as a gimmick."  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       "Different Fields" is about Aaron James, a star wide receiver in the pros and a friend to a fatherless teen-ager named Casey. James has a flaw. He is a gambler, and he allows himself to be blackmailed into throwing a playoff game. There's a scandal brewing and the owner of his mythical team, the Hawks, offers  to cover it up. But James decides to redeem himself. He admits his wrongdoing, both to Casey and the world, and quits the game. At the heart of the opera is a song that James sings called "Bright November  Morning." It is a hymn to the childhood joy of sports that Reid says is often forgotten in big-time organized athletics. "I'd make one final touchdown for the fans inside my head," James sings, thinking about his childhood dreams. "But time has passed and I've lost that boy I used to be." For Reid, "Different Fields" is a story of sinning, redemption and self-discovery in the tradition of grand opera. And he says it is a story about how athletes often lose an idea of who they really are behind the exciting veneer of celebrity. "This is about a Georgia farm boy who has drifted away from himself," Reid said. "I have drifted toward discovering more of myself through working on it." Reid is the son of a railroader and his wife from Altoona, Pa. He said his childhood was full of sports and that football just naturally came out of the western Pennsylvania culture. His love of music is harder for him to explain, but by age 6, he said, he was asking for piano lessons. From grade school to the pros, Reid was always a star. Former teammates and coaches remember his intensity on the field. In the 1969 Orange Bowl, Reid stopped Kansas dead in the fourth quarter by making back-to-back sacks.

"And he backed it up on the field." But there was another side to him as well. After Penn State beat Missouri in  the 1970 Orange Bowl, he entertained at the victory party with a piano sonata.

"And when he walked off the field he was a different guy." Reid was picked seventh in the 1970 draft and spent five years with Paul Brown's Bengals. He was rookie of the year in 1971 and an All-Pro in 1972 and 1973. But something beyond football kept calling him. "He used to say: 'What am I doing here?' " said Chuck Studley, who coached the Bengals' defensive line during Reid's years. "He loved everything about playing the actual game, but not the regimentation of the football life." Reid walked out of Cincinnati in 1974 at the top of his game and hit the road as a singer-songwriter. He played little clubs up and down the East Coast and opened for B. B. King and Emmylou Harris, among others. In 1980, Reid got a job as a songwriter in Nashville. He is married, and he and his wife, Susan, have two children, Matthew, 12, and Caitie, 8. They are coming to New York for the opening. Reid has picked up two Grammy awards along the way, as well as a good living from writing 30 hit records for Ronnie Milsap, Bonnie Raitt and others. Yet Reid's life in Nashville paralleled his life in football. He was always successful and always a bit of an outsider. And by the 1990's Reid had begun to  realize that he wanted to write something more personal and complex than a three-minute country song. In 1992 he scored a dance piece, and in the past 18 months he has written a musical and a piece for piano and trio as well as "Different Fields." When Reid first received the commission from the Opera Guild 18 months ago, he thought about basing his opera on an Appalachian folk tale. But he said that  the O. J. Simpson trial inspired him to write something about the way Americans  make heroes out of great athletes and expect them to be great people as well.

Reid said that fans assumed that he was happy as a football star, but that in reality, he had his "darker moments," when he was depressed. The sports world, he said, always wanted him to be someone he was not. He has never felt like an insider in Nashville, either. But now he has found  a regular collaborator in Schlesinger, is looking for an apartment in Manhattan for working trips and seems to be more in his element personally and professionally. At the end of an eight-hour rehearsal day last week, Reid wondered aloud how  New York audiences would react to "Different Fields." "It would be nice to think that they will leave the theater remembering the story or a melody," he said. "Not that I played football."
