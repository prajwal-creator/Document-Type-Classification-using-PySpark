As a result, scholastic athletes are on the verge of becoming as important to the billion-dollar sports industry as their college brothers and sisters - and just as vulnerable to big-time exploitation. The remarkable growth of college sports events like the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament and the football bowl games is prompting fans to want to find out about younger players, the high school stars who will be the future collegians and pros filling the nation's stadiums and airwaves. The fans' interest is more than equaled by that of three other forces: college and pro coaches hungry to see potential recruits, television companies craving more sports programming, and advertisers seeking new ways to reach the teen-age market. ''We think high school sports are going to be the TV sport of the 90's,'' said Mike Lardner of SportsChannel America, a cable company jointly owned by NBC and Cablevision that reaches seven million homes. ''Now the college fan is wanting to follow the kids. And teen-agers are part of a $10 billion market.''

For example, the Final Four of the Indiana state basketball tournament is an annual sellout in the 16,000-seat Market Square Arena in Indianapolis. In Minnesota, the state high school hockey tournament pre-empts network television programming, with 11 games in the finals shown over the last three days. In Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas, Friday night high school football is a longer-standing tradition than the National Football League's Monday night football.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       What is changing is that such regional fascinations are fast becoming national in scope. The change can be seen in these developments: * The New York State Public High School Athletic Association will shortly announce a $1.5 million, three-year deal with major corporate sponsors, who will be entitled to have their names and logos on various tournaments and events. That deal and a $2 million, three-year contract for California high schools were negotiated by Don Baird, a former pole-vaulter from Australia who lives in California. Mr. Baird says he represents 13 states and expects the number to grow. * SportsChannel America is concluding negotiations to televise a national high school basketball game of the week starting next fall, and the network hopes this will lead to a national championship much like the N.C.A.A. tournament. * Ten years ago, only a few high school basketball tournaments brought teams across state boundaries, but this past Christmastime about 60 tournaments attracted teams from across the country. Top-ranked St. Anthony of Jersey City, for example, has played in tournaments in Arkansas, Florida and Pennsylvania this season. The players are not paid, but in many cases their expenses are covered. * There are now two top-25 national rankings for high school basketball teams, updated weekly and printed nationally in newspapers. In the fall, there is one nationwide high school football ranking. * In St. Paul, the rights to the finals of the annual Minnesota state hockey championship have just been awarded to an ABC affiliate, WCCO, which is paying $1.58 million for three years, almost four times the previous cost. * In New York City, the Public Schools Athletic League basketball championships are returning to Madison Square Garden's Felt Forum on March 13 after a 17-year absence. The Garden hopes to stage them next year in the main arena, where the finals were last played 25 years ago. Why the increasing popularity of high school sports? Those with a sanguine outlook say it is because fans are disenchanted with the scandals in colleges over payoffs to players, unethical recruiting and fictitious grades. Others contend it is merely a natural progression of the same impulses that have created the college scandals, which stem from the needs of three related industries: professional sports, revenue-producing college sports, and sports television.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Each of those industries needs a flow of raw materials - athletes - and as the demand for them has grown, the pipeline providing them has widened. It starts as early as elementary school, with 9- and 10-year-olds being recruited, and it flows not only through high schools but also summer camps, nonschool leagues, all-star games, and prep schools and junior colleges. And with the emergence of big-time women's sports in college, female athletes are also getting early attention. Declaring a Major Very Early The popularization of high school sports has created more opportunity for abuses. High school officials cite highly competitive recruiting, payoffs (in clothing and sneakers, if not cash and cars) and academic cheating as some of the problems that have filtered down from colleges to high schools, and to even younger students. In effect, many children are declaring a major in athletics as early as grade school. And such an emphasis on athletics often comes at the expense of education. ''I'm struck by how deep the problem is and how widespread,'' said Richard Lapchick, director of the Center for the Study of Sports in Society at Northeastern University. ''High school sports and academics could coexist if the priorities were in balance, but we're a long way from that.'' Ray Nash, director of athletics for the Brooklyn Diocese of the Catholic High Schools Athletic Association, is worried about the increasing television exposure for high school athletes. ''There are still more negative values involved than positive,'' he said. ''Is what we doing worth the negatives? The public is all behind this, but it's not a reason for doing it. Because it's high schools is why we're scared to death of it. High school kids can't cope with it.'' Federation Tries to Adjust This excursion into the big time, with its trappings of sold-out arenas, booster clubs and expense-paid travel, has also worried members of the National Federation of State High School Associations. The federation, based in Kansas City, Mo., is an umbrella organization for 89 percent of America's public, private and parochial high schools, but it has only informal power over its members.

But only 1 out of every 50 high school athletes goes on to make a college team, the federation says. And only 1 in 1,000 ever gets to the pros. The federation's official position since 1979 has been to oppose a national championship tournament in any sport, but its executive director, Brice B. Durbin, favors at least exploring the idea. ''I think times have changed,'' he said recently. ''I'm not as opposed to it as I once was.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''We do not want high school sports bent out of shape,'' Mr. Durbin added. ''We'll spend whatever monies we get on programs to address issues such as alcohol and drug abuse.'' Although there are no official national high school tournaments, about half the states permit their students to travel to big-time events that include enough elite teams to resemble national championship events. And only half the schools follow federation guidelines that call for a student to be passing four core subjects to be eligible for a varsity sport. All-Star Games, Camps In addition to the weekly polls, exposure for high school athletics comes in several other forms. One, of course, is television, where the spotlight is increasing greatly. SportsChannel America, MSG and ESPN now produce weekly ''magazine'' shows on high school sports. MSG, which televised no high school basketball games two years ago, plans to show two dozen next season. Other exposure for high school players comes at summer camps and all-star games. One of the most famous of these is the Dapper Dan Classic, an all-star game held each spring in Pittsburgh. It draws crowds of 13,000 to the Civic Arena, along with a Stage Door Johnny lineup of agents, scouts and coaches. The major sponsor at the Dapper Dan is the sports-shoe company Nike. Sneaker, soft-drink and fast-food companies frequently sponsor the all-star games and the summer camps. This troubles Jack Curran, the longtime basketball coach at Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens. ''There are too many overtones,'' Mr. Curran said. ''If you're a college coach under contract to Nike, you might ask a high school kid who's coming to your school to play in that game to make Nike look good.'' The N.C.A.A. was concerned enough about potential abuses at these all-star games - some players were performing in half a dozen or more in a season - that several years ago, it ruled that any student who played in more than two while he was in high school would lose his collegiate eligibility. Uncertain Sponsorship Mr. Curran also raised questions about in-season tournaments for the school teams. In recent months, he has taken his team to the Beach Ball Classic in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and a 7-Up-sponsored tourney in St. Louis, but he nevertheless has misgivings about increasing commercialization.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''In order to be recognized, tournaments are supposed to be run by a high school, not a private enterprise,'' he said. ''In the Beach Ball Classic, Socastee High School runs it, but it's actually sponsored by local businesses.'' Socastee's basketball coach, Dan D'Antoni, said his school is ''officially the host,'' adding that ''we comply with the local school board's regulations.'' He started the tournament to bring attention to Socastee and his team, he said, because the area is traditionally ''football territory.'' ''I figured the best way would be to bring in teams from around the country,'' he said. The top in-season high school tournament in basketball is generally conceded to be the King Cotton Tournament, held in December at an unlikely site, Pine Bluff, Ark. That tournament has grown so big that its organizer, Travis Creed, left his job at the National Bank of Commerce a few months ago to become full-time director of King Cotton. He estimated it costs about $150,000 to stage the tournament, which was won last Christmas by St. Anthony. ''We have 72 corporations that sponsor us, most of them local businesses,'' Mr. Creed said. ''We'll average 5,000 fans a night. But most of the schools that come make sure they have a study hall even though it's Christmas vacation.'' The trend toward bigness, with the dangers implied, appears to be inexorable. Schools and networks are beginning to have to juggle their stated principles with the realities of life in the cauldron of national attention. And ultimately, they will be faced with the simple question: What's a high school education all about? Tomorrow: how the feeder system reaches into the elementary schools.
