Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times     (Want to get the briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up .) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Lobbying for Iran deal intensifies. Secretary of State John Kerry, Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew hold classified briefings on the nuclear accord for each chamber of Congress today. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, who had a tense meeting in Israel , is in Saudi Arabia today, a mostly Sunni nation that is worried about the growing influence of Iran, which is predominantly Shiite. And President Obama teased critics of the deal on “The Daily Show” with Jon Stewart . • Ancient Quran fragments are found.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The discovery could help resolve a debate between those who believe the Quran was completed by the time Prophet Muhammad died and those who contend it was changed after his death. • Police video of Texas traffic arrest. A police dashboard camera video shows in detail how a routine traffic stop led to a struggle between a state trooper and a Chicago-area woman. Sandra Bland was found hanged in a Texas jail cell after her arrest. • Bill Cosby’s team speaks out. In their first public defense since parts of Bill Cosby’s deposition in a 2005 lawsuit became public, his lawyers are making appearances on various media outlets today. They say he “ admitted to nothing more than being one of the many people who introduced quaaludes into their consensual sex life in the 1970s.” • Worries grow in Burundi. As votes in the presidential election are counted today, with the president certain to win a third term, there is increasing concern about instability and violence. There is great public anger in the small African nation because the president is limited to two terms in office, but he says his first term does not count as he was elected by Parliament, not voters, in 2005.

New data released today raises hopes that an experimental Alzheimer’s drug from Eli Lilly might be effective at reducing symptoms for some patients. At the same time, other data out today could dampen expectations for a similar drug from Biogen. MARKETS • Apple’s stock is taking a hit as double-digit percentage growth in profit, revenue and iPhone sales wasn’t enough to placate overeager investors. Shares in the richest U.S. company, by market valuation, slid 5 percent after the record fiscal third-quarter results, which one analyst called “mind-boggling.” Microsoft and Yahoo shares are also off after weak quarterly numbers. • Wall Street stocks  are being dragged down by the rout in technology shares.

It is part of the Dodd-Frank finance law adopted after the 2008 financial crisis, and limits the speculative trades banks can make on their own accounts. NOTEWORTHY • The book in the box. “What Pet Should I Get?,” a Dr. Seuss manuscript found in a box in 2013 and due to be published next week, is a “very good example of his particular genius for distilling both the spirit of his times and the timeless mind-set of children,” our book critic writes .

Dementia in women worsens about twice as fast as in men, researchers report. And a study suggests that many men gain three to five pounds when they become fathers . • For laughs. Our TV critic writes that “ Sharknado 3 ,” which premieres today, “cranks up the absurdity level to hilarious proportions” and that “it will leave everyone who sees it speechless” (9 p.m. Eastern, Syfy). • Quick peek at 007. The first full trailer for “Spectre,” the James Bond thriller opening in the U.S. on Nov. 6, is released online today. • In memoriam. E. L. Doctorow ’s award-winning novels — including “Ragtime,” “Billy Bathgate” and “The March” — put fictional characters in historical contexts and unconventional narrative forms. He died on Tuesday in New York at the age of 84. BACK STORY When the U.S. women’s soccer team won the World Cup on July 5, it was before an American television audience of 26.7 million people. In contrast, the athletes representing 41 Western Hemisphere teams in the Pan Am Games, which end on Sunday, are getting little attention.

Credit José Méndez/European Pressphoto Agency    Even residents of the host city, Toronto, haven’t been terribly enthusiastic . It’s not that the event is small. Among multisport, multinational competitions, only the Olympics and the Asian Games are bigger.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But the Pan Am Games faltered from the start . They began as part of the Greater Texas and Pan-American Exposition in Dallas in 1937. The next competition was canceled because of World War II. Buenos Aires finally managed to put the Games on the map in 1951. They’ve been held every four years since, through political turmoil, boycotts and host cities dropping out. But many top athletes don’t participate because the events at the games do not serve as qualifiers for the following year’s Olympics. Still, that doesn’t mean we’re not counting the medals. At the start of today’s competition, the U.S. is in first place and Canada is second. Victoria Shannon contributed reporting.
