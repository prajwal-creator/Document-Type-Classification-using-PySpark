The following is a partial transcript of an interview conducted last month with Times reporter Andrew Jacobs at Taiwan’s Presidential Palace in Taipei. Although Mr. Ma speaks fluent English, he chose to speak in Mandarin. Click here to read a transcript of an interview with his main opponent in the race, Tsai Ing-wen. Q: If you had to cite one accomplishment of your term that you are most proud of, what would that be? President Ma Ying-jeou: Well, to answer that question, I’ll have to cite six examples: 1) a robust economy, 2) a clean and capable government, 3) a just and equitable society, 4) a sustainable environment, 5) cross-strait peace, and 6) improved foreign relations. These are in fact the six major accomplishments of my first term. Taking them one by one, last year, we created economic growth of 10.72 percent—the fourth-highest in the world and second-highest in Asia. More importantly, we held inflation to less than 1.5 percent and unemployment dropped to 4.3 percent. We are one of the countries in East Asia with the lowest misery index and wealth gap.

We were one of the five biggest movers in the Corruption Perceptions Index when we jumped to 32 in 2011.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As for fostering a more just and equitable society, this administration over the past four years has introduced more social welfare measures benefiting the greatest number of people, and a larger social-welfare budget than any previous administration. In the area of sustainable environment, we reversed the past practice of ever-increasing carbon-dioxide emissions. Emissions in 2010 were lower than those in 2008. The air pollution situation is also at an historic best. As for cross-strait peace, there are now regular direct cross-strait flights, and the two sides are enjoying the best relations in 60 years. And in the realm of foreign relations, our ties with the United States, Japan, and Asia-Pacific and European countries are the strongest ever. Our diplomatic partnerships have remained unaffected; and 124 nations and territories have granted our citizens visa-free treatment. Sales of defensive arms to us by the United States have been the greatest in a decade. I am delighted with all these accomplishments. Nevertheless, there’s still room for improvement in each of these areas, and that will require a second term to complete. Given all these accomplishments, why do you think the election is so close and why some polls suggest that a third of the voters are still undecided? President Ma: In fact, at present, we enjoy the greatest number of supporters among any of the three presidential tickets. Of course, the race is shaping up to be closely contested. Even though we have achieved many unprecedented accomplishments, the public hopes that we can do better. This is understandable. Take the economy for example. We hope to help more people, but the economic crisis [of 2008] upset our original plans and has led to an unemployment rate today of 4.3 percent as opposed to our target rate of 3 percent. The same is true of the gap between rich and poor. So we need more time to realize our ideals. People are more and more realizing that my staying in office will bring greater prosperity, as well as social fairness, and be better for the environment. We have not publicized our achievements sufficiently; there are many things we have accomplished that people are not aware of. This is an area in which we will indeed improve.

According to press accounts, he will be the highest ranking American official to visit Taiwan in a decade. Given how close Taiwan and the U.S. are, does it bother you that high-ranking American officials rarely visit Taiwan because Washington is leery of offending China? President Ma: We’re pleased to see high-ranking U.S. officials visit Taiwan, as this indicates Taiwan and the U.S. have re-established mutual trust at high levels of government. Over the last four years, we have worked closely with the U.S. While developing our cross-strait policy, we have managed our relationship with the U.S. in such a manner as to avoid surprises and remain low-key. This has helped increase mutual trust to a degree not attained by the previous administration or some others before it. This is exemplified by remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Hawaii that “Taiwan is a very solid strategic security and economic partner of the United States.” This is the sort of statement high-level U.S. officials would, in the past, have rarely made. Another example is when, at the World Health Assembly in May, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius remarked that no U.N. body had the right to unilaterally determine Taiwan’s status. Such remarks have no precedent. This shows that the bilateral relationship is the best it has been in the last 30 years. Moreover, with cross-strait relations having improved, it has become easier for the United States to implement its own policies concerning Taiwan and mainland China. Also, the impression of international media is that Taiwan is no longer regarded as a troublemaker, but rather, as a force for peace. Q: In your 2008 campaign, you had specific goals for the Taiwan-American relationship― visa-free access to the U.S., and trade and extradition pacts ― but none of those have happened. Are you disappointed and do you feel Taiwan deserves more from the U.S.? President Ma: Taiwan-U.S. bilateral relations, in the area of security cooperation, for example, are the best they have been for 30 years. In three separate lots, the U.S. has sold a total of US$18.3 billion worth of [defensive] armaments to the Republic of China, the most in a decade. Aside from this, we are working hard to join the U.S. visa-waiver program. We have nearly fulfilled all of the criteria for becoming a “candidate country,” a status we hope to achieve next year. We are also negotiating an extradition accord with the U.S. Free trade agreement negotiations have moved forward, step-by-step, with further discussions held within the parameters of the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA). However, the two sides still have differences concerning U.S. beef exports, which we are still discussing with the U.S. while fostering communication with the public here at home. We have been fully accommodative of U.S. global policies, such as its anti-terrorism policy. We have had great success with our participation in the Megaport Initiative. The U.S. has also been active in fighting human trafficking, an area in which we have long been ranked at the forefront with one of the best records. In addition, the Republic of China has worked side by side with the U.S. on many policies consonant with U.S. interests. This is a major reason behind the recovery of a high level of bilateral trust, which includes cross-strait policy.

How do you feel about the Obama administration’s decision? President Ma: We have a long list of weapons we would like to purchase from the United States. We are quite satisfied with the part that we’ve acquired over the past three years, but we are still working on the purchase of F-16 C/D aircraft and diesel submarines. Upgrading the fighter jets is an important item. Currently, we have 145 F-16 A/B fighter planes, but these are reaching the end of their usable lifespan. We are concerned about the availability of spare parts. We have gained U.S. approval to upgrade these fighter planes. Part of the upgrade will give our fighters capabilities that even the F-16 C/D does not have. We are very grateful for this. We will continue our efforts to acquire F-16 C/D aircraft, as our request has not been rejected by the U.S., which says it is still considering our requests, including that for diesel submarines. We understand that the United States has its own difficulties, but in view of our national defense needs, we will continue to seek purchases from the United States. The F-16 A/B upgrade just mentioned involves components whose performance exceeds that of current F-16 C/Ds, including avionics and radars. Q: When you look across the Taiwan Straits and look at China, what do you see? A friend, a competitor, an enemy? President Ma: Before I took office, when we were drafting a cross-strait policy, we clearly understood that mainland China had already risen to become a major global economic entity, and that we must face the fact. We realized that the mainland presented a risk, but also an opportunity. Over the past three years, we have striven to minimize the threat and maximize the opportunity. For instance, since we have yet to identify a way to resolve the sovereignty issue between the two sides, we have set it aside by utilizing the “1992 consensus” that there is only one China, but each side maintains its respective interpretation of what that China is. This has allowed bilateral cooperation on more pressing issues to remain unobstructed by differences over sovereignty. While implementing these tasks, we have been very careful to first establish a framework. For instance, under the framework of the Republic of China Constitution, we have adopted the principle of “no unification, no independence and no use of force.” “No unification” means we will not discuss unification during my term of office. “No independence” means we will not pursue Taiwan independence. “No use of force” means not using force to resolve cross-strait issues. The maintenance of the status quo under these principles has the support of 86 percent of Taiwan’s people and can thus be regarded as mainstream. The consensus on “one China, respective interpretations” has also gained broad support. These principles established under the framework of our Constitution have allowed the two sides to shelve disputes while creating a win-win situation, and constitute the most important factor in the peaceful progress of cross-strait relations over the past three years.

The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have many issues yet to discuss; the process could be said to have only just begun. Take the Cross-Straits Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement for example. We have only completed negotiations on about one-fifth of its content. Many things remain that will require much more effort to accomplish.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Q: Given all your accomplishments improving relations with China, why do you think the Chinese government has yet to make a gesture of reducing some of the 1,000-plus missiles that are aimed at Taiwan? President Ma: I believe that mainland China has not changed its objective regarding Taiwan, which is to achieve “one country, two systems” and “peaceful unification.” However, as a result of the improvement in cross-strait relations, mainland leaders talk less of these policies now than in the past because maintaining the current state of affairs is in the interest of both sides. Thus, the mainland so far has not made any changes to the actions taken under its original policies, including those relating to missile deployment. This is of course not favorable to maintaining the status quo or the peaceful development of cross-strait relations. We have brought this up many times before, and we inevitably take these factors into consideration when promoting cross-strait relations. As I just mentioned, there are risks, so we must be very careful. So when dealing with cross-strait matters, we always proceed carefully one step at a time, and follow the principle of addressing pressing matters before less pressing ones, easy issues before difficult ones, and economic issues before political ones. Judging from our endeavors over the past three-plus years, we are on the right track. The more we create a peaceful cross-strait atmosphere, the less possibility there will be of confrontation, conflict or even war. I believe this is the best strategy for Taiwan. Q: Your main opponent suggests that your policies have made Taiwan and China too intertwined and led to a loss of sovereignty. How do you respond to such allegations? President Ma: The opposition has been making empty accusations for over three years now. Every time I ask them to give an example of where I have conceded Taiwan’s sovereignty, they have nothing to say. We have signed 16 agreements with mainland China. Every one of these has been openly signed and not one touches on political issues. So, under such circumstances, when they claim that I have sacrificed Taiwan’s sovereignty, we respond, “show me one” example, and they cannot do so. They only use this as a political tool and pretext; it is utterly baseless. As a matter of fact, I can cite an example of its speciousness. Taiwan has participated in the past three sessions of the World Health Assembly (WHA). This was not previously possible under the DPP administration. During that time, Taiwan was only able to send lower-ranking officials to technical meetings and could not be represented by minister-level officials. However, we have done it; we have been able to participate as an “official observer” under the name “Chinese Taipei.” The DPP was unable to do that. In other words, not only have we not sacrificed Taiwan’s sovereignty but, instead, we have significantly increased Taiwan’s visibility. Another example is our recent success in winning the right to host the 2017 World University Games. The DPP administration twice failed in its bid to hold the event, but we have succeeded. We can clearly see that the benefits of improved cross-strait relations are not limited to the Taiwan Strait but have extended to the international community where Taiwan’s visibility has increased. Similarly, the Republic of China lost six of its diplomatic allies during the DPP administration, but not a single country has severed official ties with us under my watch. When we first came into office, Taiwan was accorded visa waiver privileges by 54 countries and territories. The number is now up to 124. This was something that the DPP could not achieve. In other words, under this administration, our national sovereignty has not suffered; instead, we have gained even greater respect from the global community. These empty accusations by the DPP are not supported by any concrete fact. There is no truth in them, just as there is none in their other criticisms of me. I trust that our people will be able to judge for themselves.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Let me offer yet another example. During Ms. Tsai Ing-wen’s terms as vice premier of the Executive Yuan and minister of the Mainland Affairs Council, Taiwan’s representative attended the WHA under the name “Taiwan, China.” This was a name most strongly opposed by the DPP, yet the administration used it 18 times, including six times while Ms. Tsai was vice premier. We have participated in the WHA three times, each time under the name “Chinese Taipei.” While the people of Taiwan are not happy with this name, it is one they can live with. In addition to the WHA, we have also acceded to the World Trade Organization’s Government Procurement Agreement. Furthermore, we have signed an investment protection arrangement with Japan, which was the first time in 60 years. At the same time, we are engaged in negotiations on signing an economic cooperation agreement with Singapore. We are also conducting feasibility studies on a similar pact with New Zealand. All this would have been totally impossible under the DPP administration. Clearly, through such agreements and participation in global activities, our sovereignty has been accorded much greater respect, which is most important for Taiwan. In contrast, the DPP’s confrontational policy forced the world community to distance itself from Taiwan. We feel that our policy is beneficial to Taiwan and is a direction that we should take in the future. Another important point is our relations with Hong Kong. In the past, Taiwan’s representative office in Hong Kong did not have an official name. It was known as “Chung Hwa Travel Service.” This year, however, it was renamed “Taipei Economic and Cultural Office” in line with Taiwan’s other representative offices abroad. This was the biggest change in Taiwan-Hong Kong relations in six decades—an obvious result of improved cross-strait relations. This was something the DPP administration could not have achieved. Q: Semantics is an important part of the relationship between Taiwan and in China. As you noted, it can be tricky. Even at The New York Times, we don’t use “nation” or “country.” How do you feel about that? President Ma: Of course we are a country—and an independent and sovereign nation. We have diplomatic relations with 23 countries and substantive ties with more than 100 others around the world. But their developing relations with us have been subject to many limitations as a result of the existence of mainland China. Nevertheless, this situation has changed with the improvement in cross-strait relations since we took office. Now, countries are willing to have better relationships with us because they think, “If mainland China is willing to improve its ties with Taiwan, why can’t we?” Of course, the mainland still engages in maneuvers that cause us problems, but certainly less so than before. Q: If President Hu Jintao of China called you tomorrow and said, “Come on over!” or “I’d like to come to Taiwan, can we meet…” how would you respond? President Ma: I don’t think this is possible at present, because I am the president of the Republic of China. If I were to meet with the leader of mainland China, I would do so while maintaining my title of President and there is no way that this would be acceptable to them. Therefore, I will not be visiting mainland China, and I don’t believe Mr. Hu Jintao would visit Taiwan at this juncture. This is a completely hypothetical situation. Up to now, the two sides have not reached any consensus on the sovereignty issue, so it is totally hypothetical and could not happen right now. At this stage in cross-strait relations, it is in the best interest of both sides to move forward one step at a time. What matters most is that people can accept and are satisfied with this kind of progress. A meeting between leaders of the two sides is not the top priority in cross-strait relations, so I will not visit the mainland over the next four years. Q: In the last few years, the Chinese military has become much more ambitious, some would say aggressive, especially when it comes to the South China Sea. Do you worry that the time will come when the Chinese military might become so strong that the balance of power shifts so dramatically and Taiwan has little chance defending itself?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   President Ma: Mainland China has poured considerable resources into its military over the past 20 to 30 years. As a result, its military power has grown dramatically. In fact, the military imbalance between the two sides began in 2005. However, in terms of the big picture, Taiwan cannot get into an arms race with mainland China. Hence, the defense strategy we have developed principally involves fostering the kind of situation in which mainland China would not think of resorting to military force to resolve cross-strait disputes. Thus, I have made cross-strait relations, and especially the institutionalization of cross-strait reconciliation, the first line of defense for Taiwan’s security. Judging from the current situation, the Taiwan Strait region is increasingly peaceful and prosperous. I believe that no one would think of changing this situation, since the price would be too high for either side to pay. This is the best defense for Taiwan’s security. However, that does not mean that we do not need a national defense force, we must maintain a small but powerful national defense that can present a credible deterrence, so that Taiwan’s security is not threatened at critical times. Still, we must stress that relying solely on military force is insufficient. Cross-strait rapprochement, which deters mainland leaders from considering the use of military force to resolve their issues with Taiwan, is in fact achievable. Q: Do you think it possible that your cross-straits policies have been too successful? It seems that tensions with China have eased so much that the voters have almost forgotten the issue this year. They seem to be so focused on very local issues, such as subsidies for farmers and retirees and on social welfare spending. President Ma: The considerable improvement in cross-strait relations that has indeed taken place since we took office is now taken for granted by the public, shifting the focus of attention to other issues. In fact, more and more people recently have said they hope that there will be no major change in cross-strait relations. The public will gradually come to realize that it is not just [the sentiment of] large-scale business owners who have benefited, but also private-sector proprietors of restaurants, hotels and tour buses, since the opening up of cross-strait relations has brought a large number of tourists to Taiwan, and not just tourists from mainland China, but also from other countries. This has been very beneficial to small businesses, including pineapple pastry vendors, boosting their sales. This demonstrates that this open policy is beneficial to the nation. I believe that most would not be willing to return to the situation under DPP rule. Recently, more and more people have voiced the hope that our policy will continue, and I will continue to strive to explain this to the public. The DPP has recently stated that it will not change the ECFA [a trade pact with China]. This demonstrates that we were right all along and that their opposition to it at the outset, and even mobilizing several thousand people to march against it, was mistaken. If they were to come back into power, would they try to turn back the clock? This is a concern that many people have. Q: How do you feel about the state of Taiwanese democracy? President Ma: Democracy in Taiwan has made clear progress over the past several decades. Three years ago when I was elected, then U.S. President George W. Bush said in his congratulatory telegram that Taiwan was a “beacon of democracy for Asia and the world.” This delighted us and made us reflect. We are in fact a young democracy that still has many problems. Our elections are hotly contested, but there are still some violations of the law. We count the vote very quickly, but there is plenty of negative campaigning that pollutes our society. Thus, while we have many areas in which we can improve, the overall direction is correct. For example, the presidential debate [held December 3] could be seen in mainland China. This has never happened before. Even though it was not carried on television, it could be seen on the Internet and this is no easy matter. If the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can reach greater consensus on the issue of democracy, it will surely be a positive boost for bilateral exchanges. Q: Speaking of negative campaigning, there was a recent story in the Taipei Times suggesting that mainland officials have been attempting to influence Taiwanese business people in China to vote for you. Is there any truth to such allegations? President Ma: I have called on mainland China many times to refrain from any involvement in these presidential and legislative elections. Early on in several presidential elections held over the past decade or so, they took some actions that were not beneficial to the cross-strait relationship. Thus, I once more call upon Beijing to stay out of our election. Q: You spent quite a bit of time in the U.S. What is the most important thing you took away from that experience and how have you made use of it? President Ma: I studied and worked in the United States over a period of seven years. And before that I visited America. I feel that for us in Taiwan, what we have gained from the U.S. via a variety of channels and which has had the greatest influence, has been the American system of democracy and respect for human rights. The U.S. has had an enormous influence on the changes that have taken place in Taiwan. We have also learned a great deal from American technology and culture. Thus, relations between Taiwan and the U.S., as far as Taiwan is concerned, have been very positive. Several decades of friendly bilateral ties have made Taiwan very happy to comply with any cooperative initiative required by the U.S. Thus, American scholars feel that Taiwan-U.S. relations are the best in 30 years, and the triangular set of relations between Taiwan, the U.S. and mainland China are the finest in 60 years. This greatly reflects mainstream opinion in the U.S. We shall continue to strive for maintaining Taiwan-U.S. ties at their best. We also hope that the trilateral set of relations remain optimal. While this is certainly no easy matter, given that we have accomplished it before, we aim to maintain it going forward.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Over the next four years, while cross-strait relations and international ties are on a progressive track, we feel we can continue to improve them. Domestically, my most important policy is to narrow the gap between rich and poor, create more job opportunities, provide even more care for the disadvantaged, and reduce the M-shaped economic polarization of society. This is an enormous challenge, but we have accomplished a great deal in past years, perhaps the most in history. Nevertheless, it is still not enough. The public is still not satisfied, so we must redouble our efforts. We hope that in the future we will see a society that can create sufficient wealth that can be shared by most members of society.
