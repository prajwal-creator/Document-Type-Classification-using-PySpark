The agency's president, Dick Pound, also urged other informants to come forward with concerns about or proof of cheating. The steroid, tetrahydrogestrinone, or THG, was identified by the United States Anti-Doping Agency only after it received a tip and a sample of the drug from a track coach, its chief executive, Terry Madden, said. The American anti-doping agency is an independent group that conducts drug testing for Olympic-related sports. Pound said: ''I don't care why somebody blows the whistle, whether it's because they're disgusted or they've seen the light or they've realized that they are giving athletes stuff that nobody's ever tested, so you have no idea what the side effects may be. Whatever the reason, you depend on these sorts of things because the whole activity is clandestine. ''I would encourage anybody who is starting to have some second thoughts about doping in sport to come forward with whatever they know.''

Madden said THG had been engineered to make it undetectable in existing tests. He said several prominent athletes had tested positive for THG in their A samples after the retesting of urine samples from the United States track and field championships. The athletes have yet to be formally identified because analysis of their B samples is pending.

The I.A.A.F. said it would punish athletes who tested positive. ''The emergence of this new steroid is a matter of great concern and we are taking all steps that we can to investigate how widespread its use has been,'' the I.A.A.F.'s president, Lamine Diack, said in a statement. ''If athletes have deliberately set out to cheat the public at our world championships, then they must be exposed and dealt with in the strongest possible way.''

''I was a little surprised track and field could do it,'' Miles said of retesting. ''It's not clear whether there's anything in our rules that would allow us to do so.'' When Pound was asked about international reaction to the investigation, he said: ''People are sort of looking at you and saying: 'Well, we've been telling you this for years. The gold medalists of doping are the United States, and here's an example of that.' Your response is, 'Well, it's easy to say that in general terms but unless you have some evidence, there's not much you can do about it.' So now we've got the evidence.'' Pound, a Canadian lawyer who has criticized the United States Olympic Committee, USA Track and Field and the major American professional leagues for their approach to drug testing, said he was encouraged by the United States Anti-Doping Agency's identification of THG. ''It certainly underlines the importance of having an independent anti-doping agency,'' he said.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
