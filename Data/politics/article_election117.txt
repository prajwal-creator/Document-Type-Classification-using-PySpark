Comey, the F.B.I. director, in Washington in March. Credit T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times By  Michael Barbaro Nov. 1, 2016 How is it that with seven days left until the election, we are consumed anew by emails, Hillary Clinton’s private server, the F.B.I. and an investigation that was supposed to be closed? In the latest episode of The Run-Up , we examine the most recent surprise twist in a campaign that never ceases to shock. We break down this development into three parts. First we sift through the essential, still-unfolding facts of the case with two reporters who have covered the investigation since it emerged, Amy Chozick and Michael S. Schmidt. Second, we examine why the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, decided to make the new findings public, by talking with Carrie Cordero, a former attorney at the Department of Justice who worked closely with the F.B.I. And to close out, we explain what impact this could have on the outcome of next Tuesday’s election, with insight from Nate Cohn of The Upshot. He says that, as with so many of the major news events in this contest, this one is not likely to be a game changer. “All those things did move the polls, but they didn’t fundamentally reshape the race,” Mr. Cohn says. “The core underlying dynamic of this election hasn’t ever changed, and that’s that a majority of voters don’t really believe Trump is qualified to be the president, they don’t like either candidate, so when the news is good or bad for their candidate they become more or less likely to indicate their support, but there has never been a time in this race when Trump has been able to assemble a clear path to victory.” COMING UP!
