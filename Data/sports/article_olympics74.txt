B. King and is sometimes credited with inspiring Ray Charles to adopt a grittier gospel sound, died on July 26 in Orange, Calif. He was 77. His death was announced by his son, Christopher, of Los Angeles, his only immediate survivor. The cause was cancer, he said. Born in Marshall, Tex., Mr. Dixon was a self-taught pianist who was taken under the wing of the blues great Charles Brown when Mr. Dixon and his family moved to Los Angeles in the 1940’s. He made his first recording, “Dallas Blues,” in 1947. He went on to success with hits in various styles, from “jump” blues to sophisticated jazz-influenced works to bawdy songs like “Wine Wine Wine.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Calling himself “Mr. Magnificent,” Mr. Dixon reached the height of his success in the 1950’s as part of the flourishing black music scene in Los Angeles. His best-known song was “Hey Bartender,” covered decades later by the Blues Brothers.

The two remained good friends, he added. Bruce Iglauer, president of Alligator Records, credited Mr. Dixon as helping to invent what became rhythm and blues, by combining Texas country blues with some jazz and swing. Although Mr. Dixon dropped out of the music scene for a time, his career revived in the 1970’s and 80’s with European tours. In 1984 he was commissioned to write “Olympic Blues” for the 1984 Summer Olympics. In 1997 “Wake Up and Live!” won the W. C. Handy Award for comeback blues album of the year. Mr. Dixon worked regularly until his death. An album he recorded with his fellow pianists Pinetop Perkins and Henry Gray is scheduled to be released this fall.
