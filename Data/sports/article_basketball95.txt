Championship Division title game at Yankee Stadium having pitched more shutouts this season (5) than C. C. Sabathia and the rest of the Yankees’ starting rotation combined (3), kept a perfect season intact by shutting out Erasmus Hall in the second half to win the city championship, 20-12. Lincoln, which finished the season 13-0, hounded and harassed Wayne Morgan, Erasmus’s dynamic quarterback, throughout a physical game played in a steady rain. “All those hours of hard work finally paid off,” Lincoln Coach Shawn O’Connor said after the game as Frank Sinatra’s version of “New York, New York” blared from the public address system. “I’m proud of what our kids did here tonight,” O’Connor said. “We proved that Lincoln is more than just a basketball school.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The top-seeded Railsplitters opened the scoring on a 3-yard run by the senior Kareem Folkes with 4 minutes 37 seconds remaining in the first quarter, but they failed to make a 2-point conversion. The Dutchmen responded on the ensuing possession, scoring a touchdown on a quarterback keeper by Morgan, perhaps the most exciting player in the city. The touchdown was set up by a 52-yard scamper by the sophomore Kahill Lewin, who was filling in for the injured Shaquell Jackson, another of the city’s elite players.

Less than two minutes into the second quarter, Lincoln regained the lead on a 2-yard run by the senior Denzel Duchenne, who promptly followed that by running in the 2-point conversion to give Lincoln a 14-6 lead. Morgan and Erasmus stormed back on the next possession, which ended with Morgan bursting around left end for a 5-yard score that sent a roar through the Erasmus cheering section gathered in the seats along the right-field line. When the 2-point try failed, Lincoln clung to a 14-12 lead at the half. After a scoreless third quarter, Lincoln increased its lead to 20-12 when the senior quarterback Jessel Jones called his own number and scored on a third-and-goal from the 1-yard line with 10:39 remaining.

After another 2-point conversion attempt failed, the Railsplitters returned to playing hard-nose defense. On the last play of the game, Erasmus had a fourth-and-10 from Lincoln’s 18-yard line. Morgan launched a pass into the end zone that was broken up by Folkes. “I knew it was coming,” Folkes said. “I just got up on my man and locked him down.” Fifth-seeded Erasmus (9-4) was hoping to win its first championship at the P.S.A.L.’s highest level. (The Dutchmen won championships in the defunct B division in 1986 and 1987.) After losing two of their first three games this season, the Dutchmen began to roll behind Morgan, who is also a standout at safety. On their way to the playoffs, the Dutchmen defeated the defending champion, Fort Hamilton, and twice beat powerful Tottenville, once in a 20-17 overtime thriller in the semifinals. “We had the toughest schedule in the city,” Erasmus Coach Danny Landberg said. “You can’t take that away from our kids.” Lincoln, which entered Tuesday’s championship game riding the momentum of a 30-14 thumping of DeWitt Clinton in the semifinal, was making its second straight appearance in the title game. The Railsplitters lost last season’s final at Yankee Stadium to Fort Hamilton, 8-6. “They got two touchdowns on us in the first half and that was it,” Lincoln’s quarterback Jones said of Tuesday’s final. “We didn’t make any particular adjustments, we just played harder in the second half and played the kind of shut-down defense we have been playing all year.”   A version of this article appears in print on December 7, 2011, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Basketball Power Takes Football Title.
