BRODY APRIL 30, 2002     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           It may seem improbable that a disorder first described in the medical literature in 1882 is still little known and poorly understood and more often than not misdiagnosed. That disorder is cyclic vomiting syndrome, or C.V.S., a very distressing, life-disrupting condition that experts once considered rare but now say is far more common than previously realized. Two surveys suggest that it may affect as many as 2 percent of children. And while children are most likely to be afflicted, it is also known now that the disorder sometimes persists well into adulthood and may even arise for the first time in adults. Some years ago, Jennifer Parsons of Chicago, then 24 and finally well, vividly described what it was like to have the syndrome.

''They would usually hit the minute I woke in the morning, or sometimes in the middle of the night.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       ''Never did I have any warning: I would rarely make it to the bathroom before getting sick. The telling symptom for me is extreme nausea, which is worsened by the slightest movement or faintest odor. ''The intervals between vomiting episodes always lessened as the day wore on, and inevitably I would end up vomiting every 15 minutes. During these episodes I am also extremely lethargic and have a difficult time talking, as the nausea consumes every ounce of strength. ''The mental pain is almost as unbearable, as you are confined to your bed, knowing the long haul you're in for and that there is nothing you can do. ''Initially, episodes were rather frequent; I could be sick six or eight times within two months. Without fail, I would always end up hospitalized. ''On average, the episodes lasted two to three days, and I'd typically spend two nights in the hospital until I was able to keep clear liquids down. And I can recall times when I would be dismissed from one of my hospital visits and have it start all over again the same night.'' Ms. Parsons suffered with this mysterious ailment for four years before the Mayo Clinic properly diagnosed it as the vomiting syndrome. Still, no treatment she was offered was able to curb the problem. Then, like a miracle, at age 14 the episodes stopped for five years, though they later recurred sporadically and unpredictably about half a dozen times.

''I am not aware of any goings on around me,'' she said, ''and all I feel like doing is sleeping.'' Her family, she said, could never plan even a day ahead because she could get sick at any time, with episodes that sometimes lasted four or five days and started with a headache, inability to swallow, dizziness, stomachache and nausea followed by vomiting and salivating. Excitement, stress (both positive and negative) and anticipation are common triggers of C.V.S. episodes. Many sufferers report that their attacks ruined many family vacations, outings, birthday celebrations and holidays. For others, attacks are precipitated by certain foods (chocolate, cheese and MSG, which are also associated with migraine headaches), allergies, physical exhaustion, motion (like car rides), anesthesia and menstrual periods. The Right Diagnosis Dr. B. U. K. Li, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago who is one of the world's leading experts on the syndrome, understands why doctors have such difficulty recognizing the disorder.

Howard, a nurse-clinician, pointed out in a recent issue of Contemporary Pediatrics that ''between episodes, the child with C.V.S. is asymptomatic and appears so normal that the history of repetitive bouts of relentless vomiting and dehydration can be difficult to believe.'' They wrote, ''Although the typical child spends 90 percent of the time well, we have documented substantial annual morbidity and medical costs: 20 missed days of school for each child, a high rate of IV rehydration, and more than $17,000 in costs for each family attributable to laboratory testing, imaging studies, endoscopic procedures, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and missed work by parents.'' Individual episodes, which resemble attacks of stomach flu, are often misdiagnosed as food poisoning. Even when doctors recognize a pattern, they are likely to mislabel the condition as chronic reflux, an eating disorder or psychogenic vomiting. But as Ms. Parsons put it: ''I heard a few parents mention that they sometimes thought their child was getting sick on purpose to avoid a day at school. Believe me, I would have taken a math test any day than use C.V.S. as an excuse to stay home.''

For each patient, the symposium continued, every episode is likely to be similar to previous ones with regard to time of onset, intensity, duration, frequency and associated symptoms and signs. Symptoms and signs that commonly occur with each episode include nausea, abdominal pain, headache, motion sickness, abnormal sensitivity to light, lethargy, fever, pallor, diarrhea, dehydration, excess salivation and social withdrawal. Dr. Li pointed out that children with the syndrome might vomit at a peak of 6 to 13 times an hour but only twice a month, unlike those with chronic reflux, who may vomit once or twice an hour nearly every day. He emphasizes that the symptoms of the vomiting syndrome can mimic some serious medical conditions requiring surgical correction -- including a twisted intestinal tract, a kidney or adrenal disorder and brain cancer -- that must be first ruled out to arrive at a correct diagnosis. He and his colleagues have found that one patient in eight with symptoms of the syndrome actually has an underlying organic disorder. Children with C.V.S. often have family histories of migraine headaches and when they outgrow the syndrome, more than a quarter of them end up having migraines as well. Indeed, in about 80 percent of cases, Dr. Li said, the syndrome may be a variant of the migraine. The remaining 20 percent, who tend to have the most severe form of the syndrome, seem to have a different pathology.

In the throes of an attack, treatments must be administered intranasally, through an IV or injection or by suppository, since sufferers are unable to retain anything, even water, given by mouth. To Get Help Those in the United States and Canada seeking medical referrals, information and support for patients who may have C.V.S. should contact the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association at 3585 Cedar Hill Road NW, Canal Winchester, Ohio 43110, (614) 837-2586. The association has a Web site -- cvsaonline.org -- and its administrator, Debra Waites, can be reached by e-mail at waitesd@cvsaonline.org. There are also C.V.S. associations in England and Australia and contacts with affected families and medical specialists in 29 other countries.
