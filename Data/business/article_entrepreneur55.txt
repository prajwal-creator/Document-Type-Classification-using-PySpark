Credit Phil Sears/Associated Press     Mitt Romney appeared on Thursday to be rapidly consolidating support among some of the Republican Party ’s most sought-after uncommitted donors, who have joined Bush administration veterans and other stalwarts of the Republican establishment in backing him as the Republican field settles. Those who have committed to Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, include James B. Lee Jr., the vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase, who raised more than $500,000 for Senator John McCain in 2008; Paul Singer, the hedge fund founder and conservative philanthropist; and John A. Catsimatidis, the New York businessman and supermarket magnate. “As all Americans would agree, ‘It’s the economy, stupid,’ ” Mr. Catsimatidis said Thursday. “Romney is smart enough, business-savvy enough, and has common sense to fix the economy.” All three were among the top supporters of Gov. Christopher J. Christie of New Jersey, whose decision this week to forgo a presidential bid set off a furious lobbying campaign by Mr. Romney and his supporters to lock down Mr. Christie’s backers, many of them leading Wall Street figures.

Loeb and Clifford S. Asness, both outspoken hedge fund managers who in recent months have sharply criticized the president and his fiscal or regulatory policies. “Mitt Romney grasps how a free economy works, and doesn’t think our current problems come from job-killing A.T.M.’s and evil rich people,” Mr. Asness wrote Thursday in an e-mail. “Nor does he think the solution is more stimulus, regulation and class warfare.”  Video   The Caucus | New Mitt Romney Donors    Megan Liberman and Nicholas Confessore discuss Mitt Romney's new donors as he takes advantage of the settled field.  By Ben Werschkul on Publish Date October 7, 2011.  .  Watch in Times Video »         embed            The shift of many establishment donors and officials to Mr. Romney signals the rapid realignment of the Republican field in recent days, with few, if any, other candidates likely to enter the race. The support of these donors — several fund-raising events are already in the works for the coming weeks — could prove critical as Mr. Romney seeks to head off a strong challenge by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who commands a deep-pocketed network of Republican donors of his own. Mr. Perry’s campaign announced this week that he had raised more than $17 million during his first weeks in the race, a figure that aides to Mr. Romney have said he is unlikely to match. And Mr. Perry, unlike other Republican rivals to Mr. Romney, shows every sign of being able to raise enough money to finance a long primary campaign. Two of Mr. Pawlenty’s former Florida campaign co-chairmen, Justin Sayfie and Slater Bayliss, also endorsed Mr. Romney, his campaign announced Thursday. And Mr. Romney has recruited veterans of George W. Bush’s administration for his national security and foreign policy advisory teams. They included Michael Chertoff, the former secretary of homeland security; Michael Hayden, the former head of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency; and John Lehman, a former member of the 9/11 Commission.

Mitt Romney, I think he’s the best general election candidate for our party,” Mr. Sayfie said. Mr. Perry has rolled out his own endorsements in recent days, many of them state lawmakers, members of Congress and local conservative leaders in states like Florida, Arkansas and New Hampshire. Some major Republican donors and bundlers remain uncommitted, like Kenneth C. Griffin, a Chicago hedge fund manager whom Mr. Romney has courted, and Steven A. Cohen, also a prominent hedge fund manager. Nor have all of Mr. Christie’s supporters migrated to Mr. Romney: Gary Kirke, a businessman who was among a group of Iowa Republicans who traveled to New Jersey this summer to urge Mr. Christie into the race, signed on with Mr. Perry on Tuesday.

A spokeswoman said Mr. Marcus thought that Mr. Romney, Mr. Perry and Herman Cain, the pizza executive, were all “great candidates.”   A version of this article appears in print on October 7, 2011, on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Romney Rounds Up Backing Among Key G.O.P.
