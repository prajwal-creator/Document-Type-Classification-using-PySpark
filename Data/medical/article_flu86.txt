A month later, three weeks after receiving a manuscript with a detailed account of the secret development of the new weapon, Princeton University Press published ''Atomic Energy for Military Purposes: The Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb Under the Auspices of the United States Government, 1940-45'' by Henry DeWolf Smyth, chairman of Princeton's physics department. Despite the technical nature of the manuscript and the fact that its contents were in the public domain, the so-called Smyth Report sold almost 127,000 copies in eight printings and appeared on the best-seller list of The New York Times from mid-October 1945 until late January 1946. It was also translated into some 40 languages, including Russian and Chinese. But the book has been out of print since 1973 and largely forgotten. Recently, however, Nat Case, a 16-year-old high school student who does odd jobs at the Princeton University Press, discovered a copy of the book that had been signed by 18 scientists associated with the Manhattan Project. The signers included the Nobel Prize winners Harold Urey, Isidor I. Rabi, Eugene P. Wigner, Arthur H. Compton, Enrico Fermi and Niels Bohr, as well as such other noted scientists as Edward U. Condon, J. Robert Oppenheimer and James B. Conant, who later became president of Harvard University. One signature conspicuously missing from the book was that of Professor Smyth, who is retired and lives in Princeton. So several months ago, the Princeton Press invited him to drop by and sign the copy. On hand to witness the signing was Mr. Smyth's Princeton neighbor, Datus C. Smith Jr., who was director of the press when the book was published.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Neither man could remember where or when the book was signed. So young Mr. Case consulted the university archivist and discovered that the most likely occasion was a conference on ''The Future of Nuclear Science'' in September 1946, a three-day meeting that brought together 78 scientists from all over the world for the first of 15 conferences in connection with the celebration of Princeton University's bicentennial.

How 3 Women Sat Down And Wrote a Novel Standing in the checkout line at a grocery in London, Jean Harvey idly flipped through the pages of a romance novel taken from a nearby rack. ''Then I thought, 'I can do better than this,' '' Miss Harvey recalled recently. Thinking it over some more, Miss Harvey decided that she and her two friends could do much better. The result is ''Memory and Desire,'' a novel of high society and love that Warner Books will publish on Miss Harvey's birthday, Aug. 23. The title page lists the author as Justine Harlowe, which is a pseudonym for Miss Harvey and Laura Bennett, who are American, and Tina MacKenzie, who is British. Recalling how the novel came about, Miss Harvey said in a telephone conversation from London, ''I kept talking about it with my two friends, and the more we talked the more we began feeling the same way. We tossed around ideas and eventually concocted a story that sounded terrific to us. But we weren't sure anybody else would take it seriously.'' The novel ranges across London, Rome, Paris and Venice, North Africa and the Caribbean, and Baltimore and Long Island, all places where the authors have lived. Miss Harvey, for example, was born in Baltimore, lived in Africa and the Middle East and has lived in Britain for the last 10 years. She is an artist and photographer, and a photo by her appears on the book's cover.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

''I thought Connie would probably say it wasn't up her alley and refer me to somebody else,'' Miss Harvey recalled, ''but she said she loved it and wanted to handle it. We were thrilled to death and we went right on writing.'' The book required five drafts, written over a year.  Miss Harvey said the women encountered no major problems during their unusual collaboration, despite having to work long distance with their American editor, Reid Boates, and having to write while each was juggling household responsibilities. ''I have four children, and Tina has three,'' she said, ''so it meant having to meet deadlines at the same time we had to keep house, do Christmas shopping and cope with the flu. She added, however, that ''any two or three close friends who talk to one another a lot and are curious could do this.'' The three women are now exploring ideas for a second book. The title, derived from T.S. Eliot's ''The Waste Land,'' was suggested by Ross Claiborne, publisher of Warner's hard-cover division, but the authors chose the pseudonym Justine Harlowe.  ''Tina's real name is Justine, and we thought that was the classiest of the three names, and the first three letters of the last name are the same as mine,'' Miss Harvey said. ''Laura got the short end of the stick because 'Harben' just didn't sound right, but we all agreed 'Harlowe' had a nice ring to it.'' 2 Serial Novels Are on the Way Apple-wood Books doesn't expect people to flock to the bookstores the way they flocked to newsstands and docks a century ago to greet the latest installment of a Dickens novel. Nevertheless, there is something almost Dickensian in the way Apple-wood intends to publish ''The Portable Peter Leroy'' by Eric Kraft as a serial novel. That is, the first two volumes of the series, ''My Mother Takes a Tumble'' and ''Do Clams Bite?,'' will be published next month, the third volume will be published in January, and subsequent volumes will come out every three months. ''There is no end to the series in sight,'' said Ned Perkins, vice president of Apple-wood, a Cambridge, Mass., publisher whose books are distributed through the Independent Publishers Group of Port Washington, L.I. In January, Avon Books will also begin publishing a serial novel, ''Blackwater'' by Michael McDowell. The first installment of this occult novel, which will be in a mass-market paperback format, is ''The Flood.'' Additional installments will appear in each of the next five months. Each book in the Apple-wood trade-paperback series will cost $4.95 and will run about 96 pages, and each will revolve around the world of Peter Leroy, a middle-age dreamer from Babbington, N.Y. The houses in Babbington, the ''Clam Capital of the Western World,'' all have stucco fronts and crushed-shell driveways, all residents drive Studebakers, and almost everyone drinks too much Leroy Lager, the local brew distinguished from other beers by the poems on the back of each label. A bit of drama occurs when sales decline after the brewery falls into the hands of the founder's son, who lacks the critical capacity to distinguish good verse from bad. Hip-Pocket Guides To Walks in New York Dover Publications recently released the first two booklets in what it hopes will become a New York walking-guide series. They are ''The Dover New York Walking Guide From the Battery to Wall Street'' and ''The Dover New York Walking Guide From Wall Street to Chambers Street,'' both by Mary J. Shapiro. The hip-pocket-size booklets, 46 and 64 pages respectively, selling for $1.50 each, outline the history and significance of landmark buildings and sites. Aerial drawings depict all the sites discussed in the text, and both booklets are illustrated with historical photographs and wood engravings. A Dover spokesman said that the reception to these two books will determine whether there will be additional ones.    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
