BROWN MARCH 27, 2009     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           Maybe your fixed costs are not as fixed you think. With the recession continuing in full force, you may  find that everyone  — from the company that supplies your office with water to your neighborhood banker —  is willing to renegotiate their existing arrangements with you  to keep your business. Closely analyze every  contract you have and look for places where you think you can get a cost reduction. Then ask for better terms. The follow are ideas that can help. IT ONLY LOOKS SIMPLE Renegotiation is “rarely easy,” write Eric K. Clemons and Elizabeth T. Gray . Usually, renegotiation is taking place under duress.  It often  happens, they write, when  “one or both of the parties have come to find the existing situation unacceptable.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   And on the surface, it is difficult to see how there can be a win-win. One party’s gain — paying less — is the other side’s loss.

NEGOTIATING 101 The ability to renegotiate successfully hinges on your ability to negotiate, of course. If you need a refresher course, here  are some  tips : ¶“Prepare, prepare, prepare. Enter a negotiation without proper preparation and you’ve already lost. Make sure you are clear on what you really want out of the arrangement. Research the other side to better understand their needs as well as their strengths and weaknesses.” ¶Think big. Begin by asking for the most you could conceivable expect to receive (based on the research you did.) “As long as you can argue convincingly, don’t be afraid to aim high.” ¶Anticipate compromise. Invariably, you won’t get everything you ask for, but that’s O.K. It’s a renegotiation. Any concession will leave you in better shape than you are now. ¶“Don’t absorb their problems. In most negotiations, you will hear all of the other side’s problems and reasons they can’t give you what you want. They want their problems to become yours, but don’t let them.” Stay focused on what you want. GETTING LOWER RENT After payroll, the cost of leasing office space could be your second-biggest expense.

The landlord is going to be more willing to grant it, however, if you agree to extend your lease at the new, lower terms. “The best time to renegotiate a lease is six months to a year before your current lease expires. If the renegotiation fails, you will at least have enough time to properly consider alternative locations.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ON THE SAME SIDE The idea of offering to extend your lease, in the previous item, underscores a point that is often overlooked during renegotiations, Dee Gill writes in Inc. Negotiation experts suggest “treating your business partner like a partner, not an adversary,” Ms. Gill says. In exchange for the concessions you are seeking, “look for something to offer the other party.”. THE FINAL ARGUMENT “If contract holders balk at renegotiation, tell them it could be the difference that allows you to stay in business,” Jeffrey Moses writes on the National Federation of Independent Business’s Web site. Your message should be that getting less revenue from you is better than getting none at all. LAST CALL “If the renegotiation is successful, everyone will shake hands on the deal (once again),” Marc Diener writes in Entrepreneur. “Make sure you get your new deal in writing, of course. Among other things, your newly written contract will come in handy when you sit down to renegotiate again.”  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
