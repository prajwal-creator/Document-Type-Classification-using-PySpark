This is the day when all the giddiness about the conference championship games fades and the excitement about a potentially thrilling Super Bowl is superseded by the knowledge that for the next 12 days you will be overrun by stories about two teams. Making heads throb even worse in much of the country, those two teams are from the New York and Boston areas, which is why Mike Vaccaro of The Post took today to apologize to the rest of the nation. We second his thought. Hang in there. The worst part of that barrage of stories about the Patriots and Giants is that they will largely be the same ones. They will fall neatly into these categories: A) Patriots want revenge. They lost the 2008 Super Bowl in devastating fashion, were denied a perfect season and this makes them grumpy. You will hear a lot about, as Dan Wetzel writes today on Yahoo.com , Tom Brady being unable to watch tape of that game. B) Eli Manning is a great quarterback now. Peyton’s goofy little brother, with his wry smile and underrated toughness, is hard to dislike, but hearing 12 days of how great he is now just might do the trick for a lot of people. Stop by Mike Lupica’s column in The Daily News to get a jump on this. C) And wow, isn’t it crazy that Eli’s second Super Bowl comes in the city where Peyton plays (or played)? These will be followed by endless stories on Peyton’s future. For today’s update, visit Bob Kravitz at the Indianapolis Star .

Ray Ratto of CBSSports.com breaks the bad news to New Yorkers that the “Fire Coughlin” debate that filled up so many of their afternoons is officially ridiculous.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       E) Patriots Coach Bill Belichick is still Bill Belichick. Writers will try to avoid this topic (expect it to grow in frequency as the game gets closer and other categories are exhausted) because contemplating Belichick causes brain cells to freeze permanently. We vow to search daily for articles that boldly break these molds, and yes, scuba gear may be necessary for the search. Today, you can amuse yourself at the Giants matriarch, Ann Mara, chastising broadcaster Terry Bradshaw in the locker room after the Giants victory with owner John Mara playing the role of mortified son. Or read about all the ways this game will differ from the Super Bowl four years ago, courtesy of Alex Marvez of Foxsports.com , despite the fact that its highlights will be played on an endless loop until next Sunday. It is worth a look a the Giants’ winning field goal against the 49ers and how the kicking team avoided the nightmare scenario that transpired in a 2003 game there. There is still fallout landing on the losing sides of the championship games. The 49ers’ Kyle Williams received death threats via social media after his fumble led to the Giants’ winning points. His father, White Sox General Manager Kenny Williams, is appalled by this , but Kyle Williams himself says he hasn’t read them. He has, however, gotten much praise for maturely handling his fate .

He did take time on Monday to explain why his kicking team was rushing onto the field so frantically for the fateful field goal: the Ravens scoreboard was showing it was the wrong down . In non-playoff news, Oregon Coach Chip Kelly turned down an offer to coach the Buccaneers and former N.F.L. lightning rod Terrell Owens says in a GQ magazine article that he is broke and without any friends. Feel free to be sad or smug, whichever you feel is appropriate. The choice in contemplating Joe Paterno’s funeral on Wednesday is between sad and sad, and you may spread it liberally between sadness for Paterno’s family and, if Jerry Sandusky is indeed a sexual predator, all those children in the true wake of the scandal that brought Paterno down. According to Scott Paterno, his father was not bitter in his final days, writes Sarah Ganim in The Patriot-News of Harrisburg, Pa ., and he told them at the end , “Take care of your mom.” As Jen Floyd Engel writes on Foxsports.com , the lesson often lost in all of this is that Paterno was irretrievably human, like we should have all suspected instead of leaning on a myth. The rest of the sports world plugs on, with the biggest news coming out of Australia in the form of No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki losing in the quarterfinals . Her loss to Kim Clijsters pinpointed all her weaknesses, Courtney Nguyen writes on SI.com , and will drop her from No. 1, but it might relieve some pressure on Wozniacki to stop having to defend her ranking despite never winning a Grand Slam. Clijsters, meanwhile, showed great toughness in playing through an ankle injury, writes Richard Evans on Foxsports.com . As hockey settled into its All-Star break, its news came out of Boston goalie Tim Thomas skipping his team’s White House visit in a personal political protest. While Greg Wyshynski argues on Yahoo.com that Thomas had every right to make his statement, Kevin Paul Dupont of The Boston Globe called it immature and self-centered to put himself above his team. Oh no, we’re talking about a Boston team again, aren’t we? Sorry.
