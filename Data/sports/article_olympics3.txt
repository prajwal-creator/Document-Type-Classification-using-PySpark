Credit Saul Martinez for The New York Times By  The Learning Network Feb. 22, 2018 This week, chiefly in response to questions about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., we heard from new schools across the country, including some in Jersey City, California and Texas , as well as from many students in Greenbrier, Ark. Those comments are still coming in, so we’re sorry if we missed some. We were impressed by the generally civil tone of the conversation over all, and by the thoughtful and honest responses from all points of view. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear just as they were originally submitted. _________ Image Students and parents after a gunman shot and killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday. Credit Saul Martinez for The New York Times Our most-commented-on post this week was, unsurprisingly, “ What Is Your Reaction to the Deadly Shooting at a Florida High School? ” Students unanimously expressed sadness, disgust or horror. There was a wide range of views from students as to the root of the problem of mass shootings in schools, but most commenters mentioned stricter gun laws as a partial solution. BEATTY from SHS Swamp’s comment garnered a “Reader’s Pick”: It’s obviously not right what he did and what all the other school shooters did. The government needs to actually do something instead of showing their “grievance” about the topic. After the Columbine Shooting every town had to have a security guard or a resources officer but as we can all see that has done absolutely nothing. The Florida high school had multiple guards at the school yet he still got in the school, pulled the fire alarm, shot multiple students/ teachers, AND pretended to be one of the students that were trying to escape. The fact that he was able to buy an AR-15 LEGALLY is not good at all. It shows how easy it is to get an AUTOMATIC weapon even with the mental troubles that he as a child and into his teenage years. The US needs to do something about this “epidemic” and they need to do something about it quickly. Anna Marston from Swampscott High School in Swampscott, Mass., said she was going to march in protest: When I received the notification from my iPhone’s “News” app that this shooting took place, my heart sank as I couldn’t begin to imagine the fear rushing through the minds of the parents, teachers, and students whose lives were in jeopardy. While my school has not faced any gun violence, I do recall a time in middle school where a student brought a bullet in their backpack to school — I was petrified. In seventh grade after the Newtown incident, I was too scared to go to school for a few days. Guns — ARs in particular — absolutely terrify me and it blows my mind how it takes this many gun-related deaths to heed attention of the country. My school has practiced lockdowns and mentioned the training of ALICE drills but we have not been trained, and this scares me because I would freeze up and not know what to do in the case of an active shooter. I do not believe there are enough school security precautions nor counseling resources in my high school. Honestly, I don’t feel safe in school anymore. My town is incredibly safe and the “odds” might be low of a school shooting, but this does not mean that we’ll be free of any gun violence as this has been the 18th massive school shooting in 2018 alone. I don’t feel that it’s a problem with my school but more a larger political/cultural/governmental problem in the United States, because schools did not face these same acts of violence in earlier years. I am hoping to attend the March For Life on March 24th in Boston Common to protest. Jianwei Li from Philadelphia said no place was safe until stricter gun laws are in effect: The problem with the school shooting isn’t necessarily that the school isn’t safe or that it has bad security. This is happening again and again and nothing is changing. How do we expect to prevent this if we’re the ones letting it happen? Anyone can be a victim and any school could be the next potential site for another shooting. What we need right now is change. The government needs to make stricter gun laws to prevent dangerous people getting their hands on a gun. If you look at statistics from other countries where they have stricter laws, there are less incidents happening. If a 19 year old with a mental illness can get a semiautomatic rife, how safe really is our country? SLM from Philadelphia had some concrete suggestions: The gun control laws in this country are horrific. No one else has this many mass shootings or as many guns. Australia hasn’t had a mass shooting since 1996. Why is a nineteen-year-old allowed to have a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle? That just doesn’t make sense to me. How many casualties need to happen until someone actually does something about it? No civilian needs a weapon like that. People always say that gun control laws shouldn’t be written because of the second amendment. But you know what, when the second amendment was written, we didn’t have these semi-automatic weapons. If you have psychosis or are prone to manic depression, you shouldn’t have a gun! What if you become sad or angry, and to feel better, you pull out your guns, and start shooting innocent people? That’s not okay! Going to school should not be a thing that makes you nervous or terrified that you are going to be shot. Dexter M from Durham N.C., said there were several issues at once: This is an issue that is deeply rooted in American culture that does not seem to have a single solution. While the FBI has prevented many people inspired by these terrible events. There is always a black market for nearly anything. So banning certain guns will not stop a highly motivated individual, however, I am not opposed to banning certain guns such as the AR-15 or Tech-9 (or any sort of semi-automatic gun capable of firing multiple shots in a couple of seconds). Banning these guns would cease the production of them, and therefore reduce their availability. Another form of gun control that could be implemented is required fingerprint activation. Therefore only the legal owner (or whoever else they put on it) can fire a shot. This would most likely help reduce the mass shooting rates, as most of the firearms used are stolen from parents’ closets or friends’ houses. In this case, the 19-year-old legally purchased a firearm that — in my opinion — should not be legal in the first place. Preventative measures could also be taken on the mental side, as it is not JUST about the firearms used, it’s also about the mental health of wielders. Offering free counseling and mental help nationwide would be a great help. Personally, I do not feel safe going to school knowing these events happen on a (near) weekly basis. While there has never been any gun-related issues at my school that I am aware of, I feel the government does little to prevent these events but give their condolences. Andrew Derushia from Wilmington, N.C., said now was the time to act: What happened Wednesday was horrific, and a serious sign that we need gun law reform. 18 lives were taken from this world at the hands of a murderer who should have never been able to grasp the weapons he used to cause this destruction. Along with the many who agree with this idea, there are also ignorant opposers who suggest the guns have nothing to do with the problem and it is all the person’s fault. Accept these exact same people are raged when background checks and mental evaluations are mentioned as solutions. Contrary to what these pro-gun people say, guns have allowed 18 school shootings to occur before the end of February. On average “6 children or teens are killed per day by guns in the U.S.” Semi-automatic guns which were made for the sole purpose of killing humans shouldn’t be allowed to be handled by everyday people. The gun used in the recent shooting, an Ar-15, can empty up to 800 rounds per minute leaving tens of people dead in seconds. If these guns of horrible mass murder were never allowed into the hands of the public these shootings could have been stopped without such large casualties, and maybe even prevented. The time for gun reform is NOW, the time for change is NOW, the time to act is NOW. For the sake of children and adults across America SPEAK UP. Doug O’Neal from Kentucky said we shouldn’t blame guns: It is a nightmare that no one needs to ever experience, no one should ever have to go through, but I can’t help to feel that the problem doesn’t so much lay with gun control laws than parental control and a failure of the so called system that doesn’t work for the underprivileged or a health care system that sucks. Before the late 80’s stuff like this was rarely ever heard of, but once kids were allowed to play video games where there is uncontrolled violence, prayer removed from schools, and music talking about killing people who have made someone mad, that’s when things started happening. The issues ahead of us is not going to be corrected by stricter regulations on gun control, “guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” the question is why? Lawmakers and legislators should look closer at the real issues and stop trying to blame a tool instead the users and the so called systems that have allowed our children to slip through the cracks of society and become a tool for their political views. The idea of tougher laws on guns isn’t the answer, fixing a broken system is a better start. When our children suffer at the hands of a drunk driver are automobiles blamed? Children are products of their environment and when legislators and lawmakers want to blame guns for the problems we face today all I can say is look a little better at the real issues and stop trying to place blame on an object that can not do anything unless it has someone to use it. rey Hicks from New Orleans agreed: I don’t think guns are the problem here. I think that the customer should be checked out and observed closely and tested by certain individuals with no mental illness. Then it can be decided whether they can pay for it, or they have proper training and all that jazz. This is a sad subject and I wish for the best of the victims of this incident but I wish that you don’t blame guns. Landon Elizabeth from Florida said other countries don’t have mass shootings: I am 15, and I now fear for my safety at school. The first problem is the gun laws itself, we need gun control laws in place, so no unstable 19 year old can go purchase an assault rifle. It’s actually so mind blowing how money hungry congressmen are that they’d rather receive and collect money from the NRA, than do what they signed up for, which is to run and protect this country. Asal Al Mohamed from Wolfeboro, N.H., said guns are illegal in his home country, Oman: First of all, being an international student from Oman, we never have lock down drills or safety precautions because these mass shootings never happen in my country. Guns are illegal in Oman which means that no one owns guns and I’ve also never heard of a shooting in Oman. However, studying at a boarding school in the U.S introduced me to the idea of lock down drills. My school has some safety precautions to prevent possible shootings. Just like fire drills, we have lock down drills that prepare us for this type of incident. We also have good security and doors that are only accessed by students and faculty key cards. So yes, I feel safe in my school. b from Wilmington would like to abolish guns completely: I am afraid. When I walked into school on Thursday I couldn’t help but think of what I would do if someone started shooting up my school. Would I live or die? Would my friends survive? Would I have the courage to help injured people? What would I do. It’s terrible that I and a lot of other people had thoughts like these running through our heads the mornings and weeks after these continuously occurring tragedies. What’s even worse is the innocent lives lost. People with so much to live for gone in an instant. People who would still be alive today if our government would pay attention and DO SOMETHING about it. I’m not saying that I have all the answers and that my opinion is the solution to this epidemic but I know that something needs to be done. If I had it my way I would do away with guns. I know that this is an unpopular opinion and that it is virtually impossible to get rid of all the guns in the United States but that’s what I would do if I could. At the very least we should do with automatic assault weapons, which by definition are used for infantry use, and have better mental health screenings for people trying to license their guns. I hope that as a nation we have a revelation and make an effort to prevent another tragedy like Parkland from happening again by snuffing out this epidemic from the source. Andy G from North Carolina thinks guns are analogous to some drugs: I would like to start off by sending out prayers to the families that lost a close one in their lives, but making guns illegal won’t help. Think of it this way; many drugs are illegal and people still get them, so if guns become illegal people will still find ways to get them. If I could make a solution it would be to give more in depth background checks. Francesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., is exhausted: There are so many things I want to say about this tragedy. There is so much grief, so much anger inside of me that inundated every other sense I felt on Wednesday. So many words I want to say to the gunman, to the high school students who were all irreversibly affected by him, to Congress. But I feel like I can’t anymore. I am so exhausted. So inexplicably tired of the needless and terrifying violence that has gripped America, that we’ve become despicably desensitized to because it happens so often. So tired of just “thoughts and prayers,” and idleness, when already over a dozen school shootings have occurred since the beginning of 2018. So tired of mass shootings being chalked up to mental illness, when mental illness is an issue globally, yet the U.S. is still the only nation where this regularly happens. So tired of hearing “guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” when we should be fixated on the fact that people are being killed in the first place. So tired of seeing that an amendment that was written over 200 years ago is being protected over the lives of children who didn’t deserve this. So tired of every single victim of gun violence being overlooked, not given justice, and forgotten about because our government puts them on the back burner. I am tired, and ashamed of this country and the people who run it. Weapons should not take priority over people any longer. Things need to change. And they need to change now. Olivia Lain from Wrightsville Beach, N.C., wants her children to grow up in a world where gun violence is a thing of the past: In America, mass shootings have become an epidemic. What is the appropriate response to an epidemic? Eradication. When smallpox was an issue, we did all in our power so that no one could get smallpox ever again. Vaccines weren’t given to a select few, they were given worldwide so that absolutely no one would suffer from it, and there hasn’t been a case of smallpox since it was officially declared eradicated in 1980. Action was taken by those in power to eliminate the disease, real action, not just their “thoughts and prayers”. The phrase “thoughts and prayers” should be used in cases of unpreventable destruction, such as an earthquake, and not the destruction that could be solved by the passage of legislation by Congress, preventing such deaths. Banning all semi-automatic guns and assault rifles at the very least would prevent the mass shootings we see all-too-often today. Another phrase that gets tossed around often in the wake of a mass shooting is “guns don’t kill people, people do.” While this is true in a sense, you could kill a lot more people at once with an AR-15 than with a knife. Rennat Hosley from Wilmington, N.C., thinks the Second Amendment is out of date: I have to start off by saying this was very tragic event that happened on Valentine’s Day, I give my prayers to the families whose loved ones passed during the shooting. The way people obtain guns need to be restricted, or harder to obtain, I know the 2nd amendment is the right to bear arms, and people take that law very seriously, but nowadays we really don’t need the weapons. Also many people use the weapon for bad uses like murder, or intimidating people and that’s increasing many crimes. According to the article it says the man was using an AR-15 assault rifle and according to the laws of gun control you can purchase an AR-15 when you’re at the age of 18 with a license but you have to be the age of 21 to purchase a handgun. That doesn’t make much sense from the fact that an AR-15 can be more deadly than a handgun. I hope someday we can fix this problem happening in America. Manuel Garza from Los Angeles focused on the Florida students’ experience: I heard that students were Snapchatting their experience during the whole thing. And that people are calling them out and saying that what they were doing was stupid. Which is very insensitive since the students didn’t know what else to do. One student said that they were all calling 911 and 911 told them to stop calling. Amber M from  South Carolina relayed personal experiences: A couple years ago there was a gun incident at my brother’s school — a kid brought a gun to show off to his friends, it accidentally went off. It was chaos for awhile, people didn’t know if it was an accident or not. All my family knew was that a shooting had occurred at my brother’s school, everyone was so worried. At my old school, a kid brought a gun to school this year and went running through the halls with it. He didn’t shoot anyone, but he escaped campus and caused a big police chase. A lot of fear in both of those incidents when families were still figuring out what was going on. Every year we have to watch videos on what to do if a shooting occurs, and they always remind us of the genuine danger that schools can present these days. It’s frightening to have to worry about friends and siblings whenever there’s an incident. Especially in my state, where guns are really easy to obtain, there’s a lot of worry. Luiza Sulea from Philadelphia replied to Amber M and took issue with some schools’ gun policies: Wow, that is so scary. I think that if something like this happened in my school, I’d be too panicked to breathe. Even in these “nonviolent” gun situations, it just shows how terrible and how easy it is to sneak a weapon into school. I read something a while ago that a student wrote. She said that it was against her school’s policy to wear a tube top, but the students were allowed to carry a weapon under 4 inches. I don’t necessarily know if this is true, but I wouldn’t doubt it with all the weapon and gun violence that has been happening recently. Deana Perera from Bryant, Ark., suggested things schools can do: The school shootings that periodically erupt all over the United States are terrible and my heart is filled with sorrow at the thought of so much suffering. May God please bless all those suffering from the shooting yesterday. Thankfully at my high school we have not had to suffer through any shootings recently. I believe that tightening gun laws will only solve half the problem because I feel that schools can do more on their part in taking good security measures. Some pretty good security measures that all schools might want to consider are resource officers and student IDs. The resource officers not only intimidate any one who poses a threat from outside the school, but their presence also effectively discourages violence within the school. Threatening disciplinary action to anyone walking around without a student or administrator’s ID, all schools can be very careful about who they let on campus. Another step schools can take is an alert system that connects to all administrators’ phones so that if there is a threat to the school, all administrative personnel can be immediately notified without having to spread the information through the intercom system and also alerting the shooter. The awful shootings are heart-wrenching and devastate many lives. We need to do everything we can to help each other and keep our schools safe. These precautionary steps aren’t always the cheapest, but can anyone really put a price on how much people’s lives are worth? Oliver D. from Central Texas knows what to do in the event of an active shooter, thanks to a teacher: With the influx of school shootings this year, I feel like the schools in my area are growing less and less safe. A year or so ago, one student made a threat against the school on social media, claiming he would blow up the gym during a pep rally. The next day, after the comments had been posted, the school looked like a ghost town. Parents kept their kids home and kids skipped collectively. We did not address the issue in school, just went on after we realized the threat was empty. The panic of that day, of not knowing if some upset student would come in and target me and my friends or if we were afraid for nothing. My health science teacher, of course, was my savior when it came to situations like this, having given my class a semester of CERT (Civilian Emergency Response Training) I know what to do, where to go, and how to get my classmates out. The ONLY solution is gun control Borad Manuch from Texas reacted to the shooting with “bitter acceptance”: My reaction to the Florida shooting was actually just solidly passive and bitterly accepting. “It was another school shooting, nothing shockingly knew,” I thought. You’d think that at this point in time, after so many school shooting cases, that the higher ups that run our country would have already taken care of it. But as everyone can see now this isn’t the case. While I do understand that the having the right to bear arms is part of the American identity but as a collateral to having that much power in a person’s hand, then there should be strict ways to obtain a gun. I don’t have the slightest idea on how to effectively prevent a school shooting but that is not up to me to decide neither it is my responsibility to do so. But I do know what thing for sure and that is to obviously do something to prevent school shootings. Ronald Zigler from Lansdale, Pa., made an analogy to a myth: I am reminded of the story of the Minotaur, or of any ritual from ancient legend in which children were sacrificed as a form of tribute. The parallels to our contemporary world are only too clear. For far too many politicians and gun-worshippers, periodic human sacrifice is the necessary tribute that sustains their devotion. As Carl Jung, Aldous Huxley and Joseph Campbell would have each pointed out, our modern civilization is but a veneer, that is often quite transparent. _________ Video Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control. Published On Feb. 16, 2018 A related Student Opinion question, “ Can High School Students Make a Real Impact on the Problem of Gun Violence in the United States? ” was also popular. Below, we’ve posted first those responses that answer our overarching question, then those that share opinions on guns and gun control in general. Jason Curnett from Arkansas said students already were making a difference: Can high school students make a difference when it comes to gun control? I say they already are. Why change is happening now, after 19 years since the shooting in Columbine, why it took yet another mass shooting to become highly public, why it took seventeen more deaths, why we had to endure this many tragedies before a change is actually happening, I have no idea. However, the work that the students from Florida are doing is phenomenal. It takes a tragedy to make a change, but it shouldn’t have taken this many tragedies. So, to answer the question, yes they can. In fact, they seem to be doing a better job of making a change than anyone has before. Luke Lamporte from Wilmington, N.C., said his perspective was changing: I am a Republican, born and raised. I am also all for the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, and I believe that the government should not have complete control over our guns. But after seeing school shootings like this over and over on the news, there comes a time when any rational person must think “Hmm, maybe we should try to do something about all these shootings.” What these students went through is absolutely heart breaking. I couldn’t imagine what some of the kids, especially the younger kids must have felt. This is something that will change their lives forever. And if we just choose to see the whole situation as it is, a terrible thing, and if we don’t look at the good that could possibly come from this, then nothing will change. This event, as horrible as it is, sparked a flame of inspiration inside the hearts of these students to go and make a difference and I believe this terrible act of violence does in fact have the potential to turn into something good. Ever since I was old enough to really start watching the news I’ve been seeing almost countless reports on shootings all around the country. Honestly, I found myself growing numb to them. But hearing all these stories of the kids doing heroic things and all the students getting together for a great cause to help save lives and protect future generations has lit a spark in me too. I intend to help these students in any way possible to accomplish their goal of having stricter regulations on guns. Jordyn I from Westfield, N.J., said this generation had the power to change the world: I believe that my generation has the power to change the world more than any group before us. Unlike the generations in decades past, we have more information available to us than ever before. Social media, arguably the most powerful tool of communication in the history of the world, is at our fingertips. With the click of a button, our words can be shared with millions. All it takes is one tweet, one post on Instagram or Facebook. And a second later, your opinion is broadcasted everywhere. The internet has empowered us to have the ability to change the world, even at the young ages that we are. Ryan French from Wilmington, N.C., said school walkouts were showing people that change needs to happen, and happen fast: I do think that there is a way for students to make the government make changes to gun laws. With the school walkouts that are currently happening along with the Moms Demand Action group creating a whole nother separate group, student focused advocacy group, something needs to be done and will be done after more people start to join in on these things. These kids were born into a world where they have to practice lockdown drills and even fathom the thought that a school shooting could happen at their own school.The people affected in this school shooting are speaking out, whether or not they are doing it in public or behind locked doors they are talking about this. Luckily with the power of the internet the students made videos and posted them online where we could see them and see how they really feel about the gun laws. In one of the videos a parent is talking about their child and how she was shot at school and he then says, “don’t tell me there’s no such thing as gun violence”. The video then cuts to people chanting, “no more guns, no more guns”. Now I don’t completely agree with the crowd on this but I do think there should be a change to gun laws and that change and the law needs to happen fast. Emiko Andrews from Wilmington, N.C., said the tragedy had caused students to rise up: I believe that from the ashes of this tragedy, we are seeing high schoolers gain a new voice. From the combination of the age of the victims, to the devastation that occurred on the 14th, to the frequency of mass shootings, many of us are yearning to make change in any way we can, because we see ourselves in the victims. By protesting and walking out of school, and by keeping pressure on representatives and the NRA, we will make our voices heard. Will this effect change? I hope so. I don’t want to keep worrying about being gunned down in my own school, or seeing my classmates die. Emma González is just one powerful voice being heard today, but it will take all of our efforts if we hope to see an end to mass shootings. McKenzie Ingram from Wilmington, N.C. , said students should use their voices: After the mass shooting in Florida, many people from my school took to social media to rant about how they hated that this had to happen and how they hated that no action was being taken to prevent it in the future. I’m angry too, I’m angry that this tragedy is something that we have to fight for in order to prevent. In the article, “A ‘Mass Shooting Generation’ Cries Out for Change”, when Delaney Tarr stated that she, “cannot remember a time when she did not know about school shootings”, I really related to her. I remember having lock down drills when I was in early elementary school. No one ever said it but I know that everyone was thinking, “we are doing this for practice if someone ever decides to shoot up our school.” School shootings have become so frequent that I’ve even had multiple nightmares about school shootings. I’ve had around 3 nightmares in which someone brings a gun into my school and starts murdering everyone in sight. Students should not be having dreams about being shot in their schools! Schools should be a safe place for everyone, schools should be a place where students can learn and grow along with their peers. Not bleed and cry out for help. I think that people everywhere should use their voices and call for action. Honestly, it shouldn’t take this much effort for change but I think that if we all stand up for what is right and fight for action to be taken, we can and will end the fears of many people living in America: mass shootings. Monalene Delo from Wilmington, N.C., said a student’s focus should be on getting an education: In a generation where we have grown up hearing about school shootings as a regular occurrence, something needs to be done. It is an absolute tragedy to think of the lives that have been lost as a result of our current gun control legislation. Our generation has become so used to the idea that this can occur. We as students have a job and that is to get an education to make something of ourselves, but when we feel that it is no longer safe to go to school, then what? We need to make a change, in the article the author references a teacher saying “people say it’s too early to talk about it” but when is it the right time? It seems to me that every time a school shooting occurs we talk about gun control, but when will we actually take action. One recent movement “Never again” has been started by the students in Florida’s most recent shooting to advocate for more gun control. We are the generation of change. Previous generations will never understand the fear that goes through our minds. “It could have been my school, my friends.” Enough is enough. We as students should not have to worry for our safety at school. Our main focus should be getting an education. Students shouldn’t have access to guns. We need to speak up, not be afraid to talk to our teachers, counselor, and school resource officers. If we hear of anyone that could be a threat to our safety. We need to think about how this affects the lives of our students and protect them to the best of our abilities. Colby Linn from Arkansas said background checks were a good idea: By a Liberal’s logic on gun control, the best way to solve drunk driving would be the take cars away from sober people. This is what they are trying to do with firearms. There are millions of law abiding gun owners across America who use firearms as personal defense weapons, for hunting, or just for collecting. Illegal or not, if someone, like Nicholas Cruz, is crazy enough to commit murder on that scale, they will get their hands on a gun one way or the other. There are many alternatives to a ban on firearms, such as increased screenings and background checks, which I am fully behind. No mentally unstable person should be able to legally purchase a gun. Another thing is arming and training teachers. If the teachers in Florida were armed and trained, then the death count could have been much lower. Again, a direct ban on firearms will do nothing but harm, and as a U.S citizen it is an explicit infringement on the second amendment. Addison Duncan from Greenbrier, Ark., said some restraint is needed: Most of my family are strong Republicans. I grew up in a Republican house. I am also a firm believer in the Second Amendment. “The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms and was adopted on December 15, 1791, as part of the first ten amendments contained in the Bill of Rights.” I mourn for the lives lost in the Florida shooting, but I believe that we need to take some sort of precaution. My father has his concealed carry license. The ONLY reason he carries a handgun EVERYWHERE is for the protection of my family. If someone comes and tries to shoot MY family, he can protect all of us because of his concealed carry license. My parents worry every day for my sister and I to go to school because it could happen to anyone. In the small town of Greenbrier, Arkansas, NO one would EVER imagine a mass shooting here. Our parents NEVER had it this bad when they were in high school. Our perspective on this is VERY different than the older generation. Some people do not realize how uncomfortable it is to go to a public school now. My mother has constantly told me, “Addison, when I was in school, it was NEVER like this...” Overall, we need to have some sort of restraint, but not so harsh that we cannot have guns at all. I hope that being educated on this topic can have some sort of impact on our society today. David B from Arkansas said he had always feared the damage guns can cause: All of my life, I’ve grown up around guns, yet I’ve always had a fear of the damage that they can cause. When I was 10, I shot a gun for the first time; a .22 caliber long-rifle, and I loved it. I know that I’ve always been a good shot, and it was great to one-up my older brother with my accuracy. Guns are practical; they are tools that we use to hunt and that we use in War. As I was always told as a child, guns are not toys. I believe that guns are not the problem in our world, but instead the fingers that pull the triggers that are problematic. A gun cannot shoot itself, but instead a mechanism is pulled back to strike a pin and thus fire a bullet. A human finger causes the gun to fire; a human mind causes the human finger to move. The mental state of a human determines whether or not innocent lives will be lost; not a gun. Say that a shooter were to come into a classroom, and open fire on students. What would students do? They would be completely defenseless against the bullets. One way to solve this is allowing teachers to conceal-carry guns to school. Even if the teacher is shot down in attempting to defend the classroom, a brave student would likely grab the teacher’s gun and defend the classroom by his or her self. If the government allows teachers to conceal carry a weapon, there should be certain rules set into place, such as a carrying teacher’s anonymity. Overall, school shootings are a problem that is growing. The government should restrict people, not guns Bailey Stovall from Greenbrier, Ark., said the issue needed to be addressed: While most of us can not even vote yet, we certainly all share one thing. We have a voice. A voice that we can project and allow many to hear in hopes someone will listen and actually address this issue instead of sweeping it under the rug. As said in the article, situations like this “don’t need to be approached so early”, but we are far too late. This needed to be approached much before, and not just talked about for maybe half a month and dropped when something new comes to the news. No, this is an issue that needs to be addressed much more often, and high school students, the ones that have participated in the lock down drills for so long, can help raise awareness to it. Tira Frazier from Arkansas said we needed gun control despite the Second Amendment: The Second Amendment is our right to bear arms, which allows us to have guns. Freedom or not, I believe we need gun control. We do not need AR-15s lying around. Guns less likely to do damage should still be around, that’s all. This is a mental health issue just as much as it is a gun or person issue. We need to be aware that this is how it has to be: it takes 17 people to die for this to be brought up again for what to happen: nothing? This is not Liberal V. Conservative. This is a battle against unnecessary killings that take the lives of those that are precious to us. As a high school student, we can use our voice all we want and hope we get justice. Mention our peers that are dying because of gun violence, and maybe we’ll get results. Classic Smith from Greenbrier, Ark., said to take guns away from mentally unbalanced people: People will say that it’s not the guns, but the people. That is just stupid. If the people that have the guns are mentally unsound then we need to take the guns away from them. Some people will say that outlawing guns will only keep it away from the average person and only criminals will have them. However, people who have remote access to them; black market don’t do crimes like this, they assassinate people and don’t get caught. Also nearly every gun that is on the black market was purchased legally and is then sold illegally. Presley Cullum from Arkansas said we needed stricter requirements to buy a gun: I believe that our country should take action to stop these school shootings. We have already had more mass shootings in 2018 than most countries have ever had! I don’t agree in banning guns completely but I do think we should definitely have some stricter laws on acquiring them. People need to go through a longer process and have to meet stricter requirements to buy a gun. Although this won’t keep all harmful people from getting guns, it will be a whole lot harder and possibly decrease the number of shootings. I most definitely think we shouldn’t just sit back and let these terrible shootings keep happening. A change needs to be made. _________ Image Chadwick Boseman in a scene from “Black Panther.” Credit Marvel Studios, via Associated Press Our Picture Prompt "Black Panther"  brought in comments from Southern California to Rhode Island. Beatriz Mallory from Southern California was excited for the movie, even though not a Black Panther fan: I will be attending tonight’s opening at a 3D theater. I am not a Black Panther or Marvel fan, preferring drama and science fiction. My reason to attend is to participate in the excitement of the birth of a new cultural touchstone for African Americans.... As a fashion enthusiast, I am also excited at seeing how those of us who will dress up will interpret the esprit of everyday Wakandans. Nyah Price from Providence, R.I., thinks the movie will change people’s views on black actors: I can’t wait to see Black Panther, I’m practically counting down the hours till I get to see it. I am a black, female, superhero nerd and I can say that Black Panther is a Marvel hero that many nerds have been waiting to see as a live action movie. Growing up he was a character that I looked up to because he looked like me, he had dark skin, and I also looked up to his wife (Storm from the X-Men who I hope they have to meet T’Challa in the upcoming movies). Black Panther represents something that resonates with people, he is a strong, powerful, confident black man that rules a country with a tender heart. Now this generation can see what I, a sixteen-year-old girl, and the generation before me got to love and enjoy. The cast is made up of beautiful actors that get to show us their representation of a story that I grew up hearing. This movie is going to change people’s views on what black actors, and superheroes, are made of. Janelly Polanco from Rhode Island said the movie catered to all ages and all people: Watching Black Panther has been my weekend plans since its creation was announced. This movie is not only in the superhero genre, aka the best kind of movie, but it features an all African American cast. With such lack of African American actors in big, successful movies, the wait for this movie has been a long one. Watching this movie will allow people EVERYWHERE so see black excellence and success. The setting of the movie even portrays the theme of black excellence and success. In society today, with so much hatred and rare unifying instances, a movie that caters to all ages and all people is much needed. This movie has been unifying for POC I know. Even people who know absolutely nothing about the background and creation of the movie are excited to watch it. Brandon Navarrete from Wilmington, N.C., thinks the movie will unite African-Americans: I am totally going to watch the Black Panther, with my family and friends. I believe this movie will be a huge hit for Marvel and will also bring in many fans on opening weekend. I have seen the previews for this and it looks beyond good, it seems action packed, exciting and it will have a good story line leading into Marvels Avengers: Infinity War. Apart from this, Kendrick Lamar co-produced a genuine soundtrack that sounds amazing, it adds extra excitement to the movie in my opinion.This movie alongside others from MNarvel such as Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok, are connected to Marvel’s biggest movie coming in May. Apart from the entertainment aspect of this movie, there are also cultural and political sides to it, which is why I think it’s gathering so much interest among fans and critics. According to the article there hasn’t been as much hype to African-American audiences since Spike Lee’s “Malcolm X” in 1992. A huge key factor is that the cast is mostly African American apart from Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis. I can say I agree with the statement that Mr. Grey stated saying that this film should be understood in a political context in which both the legal gains of the civil rights movement and the interracial optimism of Obama era have been undermined. This movie will bring people together and unite African-Americans, the concept of this whole project is truly amazing. It’s going to be a grand expression of cultural pride for the African-American population Tyler Rouse from Wilmington N.C., said the movie offered superhero equality: Heck yeah, I’m gonna see Black Panther! It looks like a great movie especially because it has already had so much success. It’s great to finally have a superhero movie with a black cast. This is probably a big reason why it has so much interest. Many black children and little girls only have white male superheros to look up to. It’s great to finally have a black superhero that isn’t a sidekick. Also, Hollywood is starting to have more female superheroes such as Wonder Woman, the Scarlet Witch, and the Black Widow. I love how more women and people of color are getting better opportunities in the movie industry. It’s a huge advancement in equality with jobs. Especially the movie business. I am a white male that grew up loving Captain America. It would be sad to grow up as a black child or little girl without a superhero to identify with. I was Captain America for Halloween for three years in a row. It’s time for little girls and children of color to have a chance to be a superhero for Halloween. Ryan French from Wilmington, N.C., bought tickets for opening night, and said the soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar was “fantastic”: I cannot wait to see Black Panther, I actually just bought my tickets for opening night. This film has been getting hype ever since they announced it back in October of 2014, and it deserves every second of it! Chadwick Boseman’s performance as Black Panther in Captain America Civil War was phenomenal and was the highlight of the movie to me. Now two years later he’s getting his own film and I am so excited. The whole cast is primarily African-American excluding Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman but the whole cast is super stars. They have Michael B. Jordan as the main villain (Erik Killmonger), Luptia Nyong’o (Star Wars the Force Awakens), Forest Whitaker (Rogue One), Daniel Kaluuya (Get out) just to name a few. This film is shaping up to be one of Marvel’s (yet again) grand slams. The movie is a superhero fan’s dream of a Black Panther movie, and it could really intrigue common movie goers too. The soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar is fantastic and just another reason to go and see the movie. Finally we have the reason people are probably most excited for Black Panther, it is the last Marvel movie before Avengers Infinity War and everyone is excited to see how this leads into Marvel’s biggest movie ever. _________ Image Credit Gabriel Alcala Our Student Opinion prompt “ Do You Think You’ve Already Forged Your Lifelong Taste in Music? ” elicited a range of responses — and lots of recommendations for great music. Jared Duarte Massachusetts said hip-hop had been a lifelong love: My favorite genre of music is Hip Hop, I’ve been “really into it” ever since eighth grade but I’ve actually been listening to it all my life. Examples of artists: Future, Drake, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Eminem, Ed Sheeran, NF, Lil Uzi Vert. I’m more into the rapping side of hip hop rather than the actual singing, so i guess that’s where the “Old School Rap” comes into play. I used to listen to only rock songs with my Mom, Dad and Brother such as songs by A.C.D.C., Doors Down, and The Beatles but the music started to leave my mind while listening to the radio with friends because when they grew up they were listening to hip hop or both hip hop and rap. Either way my generation grew up with hip hop being more popular then most other genres. Many of my family members don’t listen to hip hop but my cousins do and as a kid I would spend a lot of time with them at my grandparents and we would I guess connect to what the artists were singing or rapping about. So yes I believe I have forged my lifelong taste in music and that taste is hip hop. Jimbus Supreme from Cool Person Avenue thinks the information is unsurprising: 1. Nothing in the article, despite the fact that the information was new to me, particularly surprised me. It makes sense that a person’s taste in music solidifies during a time which their brain is finishing development; ages 11 - 16. 2. I’ve never had a “favorite song,” but one artist I was introduced to when I was around 14 was Mac Demarco, whom I still thoroughly enjoy listening to at 17. 3. The reason early teen years are significant for forging a person’s music taste is because during the early teen years, a person’s brain is beginning the final stage of development. At this time, a person is more open to ideas and music. Once a person’s brain is effectively developed fully, though, they are less open to new ideas and in conjunction, new music. 4. Talking to my parents and other adults around their age (50’s), I have noticed that they generally enjoy the same musical artists; the Beatles, ELO, Queen, etc. Generally, these bands were popular during a 50 year old’s teenage years, so it does support the evidence. 5. Mainstream music is repeated garbage, so the challenge is actually listening to it as a parent. Most mainstream billboard hits use the exact same elements, and act as money generation machines, not music. Musical complexity is low, tracks are compressed to hell, and all of them use almost identical melodies. Often, listening to this type of music is unengaging for parents who grew up listening to much more varied, complex, and creative music. Kate Silver from Wilmington N.C., said her taste in music was ever-changing: My music taste is constantly changing. If you asked me a year ago what my favorite song was, I can guarantee that my answer is different today. Every few months, I have to erase my Spotify playlist and start from scratch because I get sick and tired of the songs on it. Just three months ago, I was obsessed with The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and three months before that, I would only listen to mid-2000s rock. Assuming this trend continues, I can’t imagine myself liking the same music I like now in 20 years. The music industry is perpetually evolving. Artists are always striving to find new ways to make their songs stand out and keep their audiences coming back for more. Who knows, maybe my favorite song will be one in an entirely different dimension that has yet to be discovered. 20 years is a long time from now.I will admit that I’ll blast Taylor Swift’s “You Belong With Me” when it comes on the radio and bask in the joy of still knowing all the words. Like the men in their 30s who love “Creep”, I will always have a special place for the songs that remind me of my childhood in my heart, but I look forward to discovering new songs and further developing my musical taste. McKenzie Ingram from Wilmington, N.C., thought the age range would be older: In this article, I really did not expect that the age where we usually find our “lifelong taste in music” would be 13 or 14 years old. I expected the age range to be around 20-27. Personally when I was around 13 or 14 I had quite a broad range of music but it’s nothing compared to the wide range of music that I listen to today. I mainly listened to “emo” bands such as, Good Charlotte, My Chemical Romance, Twenty One Pilots and A Rocket to the Moon. I think that the early teen years are significant for forging a lifelong taste in music because in these early years we are starting to truly realize who we are and who we want to be. The music that we listen to in this time is significant because we are in the midst of discovering what we want to do in life and how we want to do it, and the music follows us along the journey and reminds us of who we are. I feel that today, older generations struggle with the amount of swear words that are used in most songs today. Growing up in past generations, swearing was considered sinful and impolite. So now when older generations hear these words on the radio, they are typically astounded and wonder why these artists have to use such foul language to share the message of their song (or at least that’s what my mom does). Parker Maner from Wilmington N.C., said the research was flawed: In my opinion I don’t think the music I listen to today will be the same that I chose to enjoy as an adult, mostly because there will always be a new rap artist/album with a better flow than the one from a couple weeks ago. Now that seems like a pretty rude answer until you realize the flaw in the article... The title asks about your taste and I agree with. But the article shares research that for men that are now 38 rate “Creep” by Radiohead as the 164th on the charts, it then shares the song came out when they were 14, and it wasn’t as popular for men either 10 years older or younger. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz comes to the conclusion that when the men are 14 the songs they like then shape the songs they listen to for the rest of their life. I think this is wrong and if it is correct it needs a different, wider data set. The research tells you that the men still like the song, not that they listen to similar songs in the genre. I believe a similar explanation to explain the data is that men in women are in middle school, I mean junior high while they are 13 and 14, it has been shown that these are a challenging times in life. Songs that got them though that bring back great memories and that’s why they are popular for these men. I think other songs in the genre from when they are the age of 13 or 14 need to be compared to songs that are more recent that share the genre. Therefore I don’t agree with the article when the title is different from the research. Emilia Cordon Wilmington, N.C., was exposed to classical music through ballet classes: I’ve had trouble really finding my musical taste recently and was surprised after hearing that my preferences have probably been set already. From a young age my primary exposure to music has been through ballet and my parents. In ballet we listen to classical nonstop and I’ve grown to really appreciate it but it never particularly struck me. What really struck me at a young age was those long car trips with my dad listening to Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Police, and The Doors. Just nonstop jamming out to Bohemian Rhapsody, Black Dog, Roxanne, and Break on Through ingrained some of the best songs in the sweetest part of my memories. But I never truly found my taste until recently when I whipped out some classic Metallica and Megadeth from my dad’s collection and was swept off my feet. I felt like I knew myself, and I know that I will never stop loving metal. I don’t know why the early teens are so instrumental to musical taste, but know that for me I’ve always really liked the same music, just couldn’t really pin in down. Just play me some classic rock and I’ll be good. _________ Image Credit Lily Snowden-Fine/OCAD University As we noted last week, our Student Opinion question, “ Is Student Debt Worth It? , ” was suggested by a teenage reader. While nearly all students agreed that going to college was worth taking out loans to pay for it, they had different ideas about how much and for which kind of schools. Aubrey Ella Hyldahl from Wilmington, N.C. , thinks all students should consider cost when making decisions about college: College is a unique experience, and with that comes unique needs. I am a sophomore and have recently started looking and touring colleges to get a feel for what I want in a school and learn more about what I need to do to get there. Over the summer, I looked at Davidson College, a small, private, liberal arts college. I completely fell in love with the school and everything it had to offer. It seemed like the perfect place for me, except for the hefty price tag that comes with it. Around the same time, I toured UNC-Chapel Hill. Unlike Davidson, it is a huge school, which is something I’m not sure I want. However, the quality of education I would receive would be excellent at this state school that is tens of thousands of dollars cheaper. Initially after these two visits, Davidson was my favorite followed closely by UNC. I thought that I could handle the immense debt that would come with it, because I was inclined to follow my heart. However, after thinking about it more, UNC soon started to encroach on Davidson’s #1 spot. The reason for this is simple; I don’t want to lock myself into a major that is more lucrative than something I love to do, just to pay off my loans for a school that offers a similar education to many cheaper public schools. This is not to say I won’t apply to Davidson, but cost and debt should 100% be factored into the decision of which college to go to, especially if you can’t see yourself in a highly lucrative career. Lauren Kroell from Mamaroneck, N.Y. , is considering going abroad to avoid the high tuitions in the United States: As a current high school senior applying to college, I am well aware of the fact that depending on the college I may attend, paying off debts in the future is a likely outcome. I feel that now more than ever, at least from what I’ve personally observed, both parents and children are much more hands-on with the process, consistently weighing the pros and the cons. My family has taken the question of finances more seriously than any other topic regarding the admissions process, and it will be a driving factor for the school I choose. Especially because my family and I didn’t grow up entirely in the United States — I was born in Australia, and have since lived in Singapore and Great Britain — until recently, we weren’t aware that we may have to pay a quarter of a million dollars for a bachelor’s degree (which both my mother and I find somewhat ridiculous in the first place), nor did my parents know they would have to save up from my birth in order for me to attend certain institutions in the U.S. that may potentially cost more. Right now, I’m looking at colleges in Canada partially because my Canadian citizenship makes the costs much less expensive. I have kept in mind throughout this process that realistically, wherever I may end up — even if it isn’t my “dream school” — not only is it going to be a fantastic institution where I will get an exemplary education, but I’m also going to find a way to make it my home for the next four years, and a place I will truly enjoy and love. Kimberly Fetherston from New Jersey is taking into account how much graduate school will contribute to her student debt: As a prospective law student and someone who is applying to highly competitive colleges, I’m still unsure. On one hand, I see debt at a more prestigious institution as an “in” to better jobs as more prestigious institutions carry more weight in job hunting for recent graduates. On the other hand, for those intending to pursue a post-secondary degree I think it’s better to go somewhere you will have less debt to pay off as grad school, medical school or law school are even more expensive and it’s better to save money in undergrad. Noah Q. Berg from  Southwest-Central Wilmington, N.C. , suggests considering special programs at state schools for a more affordable elite education: I think student debt is very much worth it. Without a college degree, it can be very hard to find a good paying job that does not require backbreaking labor. That being said, it is essential for students to factor in costs in their college choice. An honors college at a state school can provide as good an education as a highly ranked liberal arts college, even though the public university costs considerably less. Myrca A. from Rhode Island already knows that money will factor into her college choices: Student loans are a frightening thing to think about for most students, including myself. Based on this author’s experience, I feel intimidated by the system because they basically crush you with all the interest rates and such. In all honesty, it has always been my dream to attend a prestigious college. A dream that seems unattainable because of the schools’ cost nowadays. I come from a working-class family so paying off such high debts would prove a challenge. In order to relieve the strain that debts may place on my family, I would choose a school based on its affordability. After all, the success of a student does not necessarily depend on the school they attend. Ambition is what determines success, in my opinion. Ultimately I would like to choose my career based on my interest but a high-paying job will definitely be appealing to me because I will need to pay all my loans. Yes, student debt is a problem in the United States but apparently, it is merely a consequence of acquiring an education. Brandon Brodwater from Wilmington, N.C. , says an honest conversation around finances can help students make smart decisions: Both of my parents came from extremely low income households. Money was always tight, so they were both completely on their own as far as paying for college. Even a small state school or community college was expensive. Both of them were in the first generation of their families that achieved a higher education, and had zero knowledge or assistance in process and payment. The only thing that they both had was drive. Today, they are both Ivy League graduates with no debt between them. Through hard work and focus, they were able to receive an education and pay off their loans. I have complete respect for them. Now that my bias is out of the way, I believe that student debts are worth every penny. A college education opens an unlimited amount of doors for the future, and with hard work and dedication, can pay for itself. Now, that being said, I also believe that many students are misinformed about what going to college entails. As Michael Arceneaux said, after taking out thousands of dollars in loans, “no one mentions just how expensive and soul-crushing the debt will be”. This is where a better pre-college education is necessary. I believe that it is important to be realistic about college with high school students, as opposed to only discussing its benefits. Teenagers need to be informed of the debt they will most likely accrue, and helped to plan school choices accordingly. If we emphasize smart financial decisions, people like Michael will have better debt situations. Sadie Gaffin from Providence, R.I. , believes the government should do something about student debt: I have always known that going to college would be expensive, but this article really reinforced everything that every adult has ever told me about the cost. When I was younger, I really wanted to go to NYU and become a pediatrician, however I recently came to the realization that NYU is one of the most expensive colleges in the United States, so I have taken it off my list. I also still want to be a doctor, but my mind is not as set on being a pediatrician as it once was. That being said, I do not have a specific dream school because there are so many schools that have programs that will aid me in becoming the doctor I want to be, so I do not need to be narrow-minded about a school just because it is one that everyone knows the name of. The school I go to will be a good school and will not put me in too much debt because I do not want to owe the bank for the rest of my money. I might take out some loans but as little as possible. I do believe student debt is a problem in the United States and it has gotten increasingly higher over the past few years. I do not want to take part in it and I hope that the government gets a grip on it. There are quite a few countries around the world where they offer their citizens free, or close to free college. Education is extremely important no matter where one lives, so I hope the United States can realize this and make it more affordable so that all students can have access. And Anna Cross from Wilmington, N.C. , summed up a lot of students’ anxiety with this thoughtful and humorous comment: I have no idea what to do about my future student loans. In high school, it’s drilled into you that a fancy college and a high degree is your ticket to a happy, successful life. “Just rack up the debt, kids, you’ll pay it off with your neurosurgeon’s salary”. But what they don’t tell us is that most student loan providers give you only six months after you graduate to get a job and start paying your dues, and it’s awfully hard to set up your life and start making bank in about 26 weeks. This means that hopeful young adults in lower to average income families are stuck in a pit of debt they can’t climb out of, weighed down by paying off loans when it’s time to start saving money for their own lives. Here comes the stories of living off of ramen and sleeping in your parent’s basement; students don’t have the cash to pay their credit card bills, pay rent, or properly feed themselves. And according to recent statistics, the costs of tuition are only going up. My class and I will be graduating in 2020, the election year. I suppose my only hope now rests upon Oprah for a change in the education system. Perhaps I’ll wait a year before going to college, just until the legislation passes through. _________ Image Mikaela Shiffrin celebrated with the United States flag after winning gold in the giant slalom. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Sports fans chimed in with their favorite moments of the “ 2018 Winter Olympics ” so far. Alexis Lariviere from Hoggard High School was inspired by the youngest gold medal winners: The Olympics is an anticipated event that so many people enjoy to watch, me being one of them. My family and I enjoy watching the Winter and the Summer Olympics together. Most of the time the Olympics don’t impact me much, but this year the games have actually been very inspiring to young athletes all around the world. So many young kids have taken home medals this year in the Winter Olympics. It is very inspiring knowing that someone still in high school (or just out of high school) has the potential to win something as big as the Olympics. This shows that no matter how young you are, if you really try for something it will happen. This statement relates to the article about Mikaela Shiffrin because when she first competed in the Olympic Games, she went home in 5th place. Mikaela wasn’t happy with her score so she kept practicing until she came back to the Olympic Games and won first place. Just a little hard work and determination changed her life. And Josh Failla from Wilmington, N.C. , was especially impressed by Red Gerard: The Olympics, either winter or summer, is my favorite sporting event. The only problem that I have with it is that we have to wait every 2 years to be able to watch the incredible athletes from around the world perform on the highest level. The competition is not the only thing that I love about the Olympics. I love how it is the perfect stage for all countries to put away their differences and to come together to celebrate. I also learn about sports that I have never heard of, and every year I learn something new. I never realized how tough and dangerous a sport like skeleton is. It may just look like they are not doing anything, but it takes tremendous control to keep the sled on the track. The most mesmerizing moment for me in this years Olympics is Red Gerard, the 17 year old US snowboarder that won gold in the slopestyle event. He is the youngest male Olympic snowboarding champion ever. It is hard to imagine how a kid only a year older than me is able to win the gold on the world’s biggest stage. He is half the age of some of his teammates, and it gives me motivation in my life that just because you are young doesn’t mean that you can’t make a difference. I can’t wait to see what else the Olympics has in store. But Luke Lamporte from Wilmington, N.C. , was motivated by watching veteran athletes: My favorite moment of the Winter Olympics this year was seeing Shaun White make his return to snowboarding and take home the gold. I’ve always been a huge Shaun White fan and used to love watching him pull off near impossible tricks on the halfpipe and take home gold after gold after gold at such a young age. Now seeing him come back and do it at a much older age just shows the true talent that this man has. I’m inspired by his drive to get better and his passion for the sport and one day hope to have the same for whatever I do in my life. Several students found joy in the way the Olympics have brought together a seemingly divided world. Abby Tank from Wilmington, N.C. , said it best: I absolutely love the Olympics — both winter and summer. I always look forward to cheering on Team USA, and this year, it’s been great to see younger athletes dominate at the Winter Olympics such as Red Gerard and Chloe Kim. You can find me sitting on my couch, squeezing the life out of a pillow when Team USA is competing in any event. Throughout the day, I’m constantly checking for updates on the Olympics, whether it’s the current medal count, results, etc. But what’s even better to see this year than Team USA is South Korea and North Korea united under one flag. It’s amazing to see what effect sports has on the world. The Olympics are respected and revered around the world, and this year have caused the seclusive North Korea to join with its southern counterpart. This Korean team represents peace, and I find myself rooting for their team just as much as Team USA. I appreciate how far they’ve gone to being a unified team, especially by making a joint women’s hockey team. Even though they haven’t won a single game this Olympics, the fact that they’re playing together is the best win of all. We can only hope that this unity and peace that are being experienced in the games will translate into a much greater picture in the future. _________ Image Credit Photo illustration by Sara Cwynar Students gave insightful responses to our Student Opinion question: “ Do You Think Porn Influences the Way Teenagers Think About Sex? ” Luke  from Wilmington, N.C. , thinks it does in many ways: I, as a teenager, definitely believe that pornography has and will continue to corrupt the impressionable minds of us teenagers. I mean think about it, “porn” is basically everywhere now. All it takes is one click to find it on your phone. There are entire magazines dedicated to it. Movies all about it. Music that essentially talks about it. It’s almost like there is no escaping it. Porn has consumed our world one way or another whether we like it or not. Porn affects the way people think even without them knowing it. The porn industry makes women look like toys and discourages their pride. I believe sex is a sacred thing created for humans to reproduce and should not be put out on the internet for the entire world to see. It also changes the way men see sex. Young kids have access to porn and if they continually watch it then when it comes time for them to have sex they will think “Wow this isn’t like the videos at all, maybe I’ll just go home and use my hand that’s a lot better.” It also corrupts the way that men view women. After watching too much porn, a man starts to find women attractive based on what their body looks like, completely ignoring her personality. I believe porn is degrading to not only women but men too. It gives young kids a false sense of what a man should look like if he wants girls to find him attractive. This could lead to a feeling of depression because maybe the boy doesn’t fit the “perfect man” mold. This should not be acceptable under any circumstances. Denislav from Wilmington, N.C. , believes pornography has taken the place of sex education: First, to comment on the ‘elephant in the room’, it is clearly obvious that pornography has a huge impact on society — with virtually almost all adults and teenagers being exposed to it at some point in their lives. Porn often times takes the place of traditional standardized ‘sexual education’, which frankly, is quite a flop in today’s system. Modern day sex-ed classes teach more about abstinence and the variety of STDs accompanied by sex than focusing on how to use proper protection to avoid any diseases or dangers when engaging in sexual intercourse. This kind of education does not help students to actually learn how to keep themselves safe and not do anything stupid — it’s just a mere warning telling people to ‘not do it’ whilst giving no details on safety. Furthermore, regarding the impact that pornography has on masculinity, femininity and relationships, I would have to say that it completely takes out the intimate aspect of the act altogether. Today’s society believes that sex is just a physical act, and nothing more. Much of the music we hear glorifies the action of intercourse and the female physique but never focuses on the relationship aspect of the subject. These messages are harmful because they provoke a message of ‘doing it just to do it’ (sounds stupid, I know) which doesn’t help people make entirely smart choices. Tucker  from Wilmington, N.C. , suggested that health classes teach about healthy relationships, not just body parts: OK, let’s all take a breather before I start writing. In a way, it is just in human nature to explore what we don’t understand, and sadly sex can fall into that category. Yes, porn is bad when exposed to society, but people learn better from experience. The issue is that nobody wants to teach us about the issue. We don’t need to learn all about the urethra and tubular organs, but rather a brief explanation as to how “it” works. I find that all media has shaped not only the idea of sex but love in general. Face it, you can’t just fall in love in a session of detention or show up in your red Porsche while you swipe a girl off her heels. The real world takes time to learn what love is, believe me, I’m still learning. If we can just teach people how a healthy relationship works without having them surf the private web, if we can have more talks to teach youth before they’re sent off holding hands, just maybe we can be rid of these concepts about what love looks like from a computer screen. Bradly from Wilmington, N.C ., proposed banning pornography to solve this problem: The topic of unrealistic and overstimulating sex also referred to as porn is a disgusting site that brainwashes anyone watching it into its lies and deceit. I don’t believe the vocabulary and or content of pornography has any purpose being on the free ranged internet, let alone in the minds of unpredictable teenagers. I just don’t understand why we are even debating the fact that porn influences the way teenagers think about sex, of course it does. When one is exposed to graphic material portraying a dominant man overtaking a weak female, that is exactly how teenagers will perceive sex to be in real life. In real life, women are portrayed as strong, dominant figures, not sex idols. The only solution to changing the way teenagers think about sex now is by destroying ponography and its content permanently. Doing this will not only save the present, but the many more to come in the future. But Zac from Wilmington, N.C ., disagreed with that approach: Our nation’s sex education is appalling. The fact that only half of our fifty states mandate sexual education is absolutely insane. It’s no wonder teens go to porn at such an early age. Our own schools completely shut down any talk of sex during the most important time of development in adolescence. Teens everywhere are going through so many changes they don’t understand and are beginning to look at the world in different ways and our response is silence. It should be no shock to anyone that so many people were first exposed to sex through porn. I’m in no way justifying minors watching porn, but for a lot of people, it’s all they’ve got. Of course porn is impressionable on someone who has no other experience with sex. The problem is when teens only have porn. When no one is there to let them know the possible dangers of sex. When teens don’t understand that it’s bigger than just the act itself. Sex education is vital in the upbringing of any child. I think we should move away from blaming porn itself and instead see that the problem may lie within our societies education systems. _________ Image Credit Selman Design For our Picture Prompt, “ Problem ,” we asked students what they thought the above image was trying to say and how it connected to current events. Here’s what they came up with: Tanya Bolick from  North Carolina wrote: When I first looked at the image I was confused. After a few minutes of looking I finally came to the realizations that the cloth represents how we like to cover up our problems, and leave them for later. But the thing is, no matter how hard we try to cover up our problems, the cloth is always too thin. You can never fully cover it up or remove the problem from your life until you face it head on. If you keep putting it off you might let the problem get too big. You could leave it until it is so bad that there is no longer anything you can do about it. The article shows that Puerto Rico is a perfect example of this. The island is a prime hurricane location and feels the pain of it every day. After Hurricane Maria the island was greatly damaged. Due to its lack of funding, Puerto Rico’s electrical system was in bad shape and the island experienced many blackouts. After Hurricane Maria it is worse than it ever was before. Due to the lack of power during and after the hurricane the water treatment plants have not been able to do their job. Many people are still being advised to boil their water before drinking. All these problems could have been mostly avoided if we had dealt with these problems in advance, or at least as they came; the situation would not be this bad. Lauren Thornton from Providence, R.I. , interpreted it this way: I think this image is shedding a light on how things in today’s society that were overlooked are now being exposed and spoken out against. From protesting against deporting Dreamers to YouTubers basically boycotting a makeup brand because they aren’t inclusive to all shades of skin, problems in our society are no longer just an at home discussion. Problems in our society are no longer being tolerated because there are so many people who have the platforms to be able to condemn them. It’s 2018 now, and we have the power to push for progress. I think this image is a sign of progress and it encourages people to speak out. Clay Krupp from N.C. said succinctly: I believe that this picture is used as a symbol that we are running out of solutions for our current event problems. The covered part symbolizes problems that have solutions or have been solved. The uncovered part symbolizes the unsolved problems in our society. And Ellie Hannum from Wilmington, N.C. , connected it to the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla.: Often times the simplest art is also the most impactful. At first glance, the image portrays the fact that humans tend to deal with problems by covering them up, therefore not actually fixing the issue. The more I gazed at the image, I also noticed that the thin bandage only wraps around part of the word. This could be interpreted as only fixing or addressing part of a problem. The uncovered part of the problem is left unsolved. This image reminds me of the recent shooting that occurred in Florida this past week. To call the increasing number of school shootings in America a problem is a huge understatement. It is a nightmare that does not end for families all over the country and that our government is struggling to find a solution to. It is as if our country has a broken bone and we are trying to heal by putting a band-aid on it. We might be covering the surface of the wound but the problem still exists beneath the surface. We can’t expect to solve our country’s problems with simple solutions. _________ Image Credit Marco Lubbers Our Student Opinion question “ Should Technology in Sports Be Limited? ” drew in responses from both sides of the debate. Josh Failla from Wilmington, N.C. , gave this compelling argument in support of technology: Watching the Olympics for the past week has showed how the difference between 1st and 10th place is sometimes is only 1 second. It seems that the human body has begun to peak in its ability to go faster. According to the data in the article, around 2005, times began to plateau. Times were becoming very similar, and it took a full decade to beat the speed skater record by Denis Yuskov. This shows me that technology needs to be a key part in not only speed skating, but other sports around the world. A competitor’s goal is to always become better, faster, and stronger. It seems nowadays that the only way athletes can improve is with the implication of technology. Technology will also influence how many people will watch the sport. Viewers don’t want to see the same speed every year, and with the implication of technology, athletes will performing better than ever, giving more awareness to the sport. If the only way that athletes can improve is through technology, then so be it. I just don’t want it to come down to robots playing the sports. Brennan Litzinger from Wilmington, N.C. , agreed and gave an example: One sport that I can think of that has definitely increased its technology over the years would be football. Back when football was just becoming a sport the players only had leather helmets, I mean you might as well wear paper on your head. As a football player myself I really understand the need for technology in football. As much as we try to avoid them, head to head collisions on the field are a real thing. I believe technology has really taken a big role in preventing concussions and other injuries in football, and it has definitely changed the game. Nick Hargrove from Wilmington, N.C ., offered a counterpoint: The “Peak Olympics” have arrived as seen in the graphs depicted in the interactive article. Up until around 1980 scores in the 800 meter run, high jump, and shot put all improved, until the scores plateaued in 1980. In another graph shown in the interactive article, you can see the male height in the United States showed a significant increase up until 1950. There the heights plateaued, even slightly decreasing in the 90’s. While technology may advance in the future the human performance of the Olympics has reached its peak. I do not think athletes should be allowed to use technology to improve their performance. Once a technology becomes crucial in order to compete at a high level, it then provides wealthier countries an advantage. Once technology provides a substantial advantage, the sport no longer is entirely about human performance and becomes about a factor that does not encourage things like dedication to the sport. Not only does it provide a disadvantage to others currently competing, it diminishes the scores and legacy of past athletes. They need to provide stricter guidelines that stay constant throughout the years so that an scores can be compared to past scores. While some may argue technology improves scores these results are inflated by something that people in the past didn’t have access to. There comes to a point where technology will be providing advantages at a level such as PED’s which are currently disallowed throughout sports. Hugo Veliz from Providence, R.I. , also thought technology should be restricted: Personally, I believe that technology should be used in sports but only to improve the fairness of the game. For example, in the World Cup, they should improve the goal-line techno to truly find out if the soccer ball fully went over the line. The limits of technology in sports should be like athletes using the technology to enhance their skills to outdo their opponent unfairly. Kasey Kiser from Wilmington, N.C. , came up with a creative solution to bolster athleticism without new technology: I believe we have reached “Peak Olympics”, especially in some events. Take for example skeleton or most timed events. I’ve witnessed countless runs within milliseconds of each other, making me question the appeal for that sport. Personally, I’m attracted to events where the competition doesn’t come in nitpicky ways, like how well you hugged a turn. I tend to watch the events like hockey, snowboarding, or other events where more grit, emotion, and even flaws are visible to the average viewer. I’d rather see raw athletic ability than reproducible “clones” of the sport. The plateau of times due to human limits could definitely be boosted by new technology. But like before, if you hand the entire human race a task and give them decades to refine and perfect their skills, it will eventually reach a threshold. Adding new tech may stir up the competition for a few Olympic games, but once it becomes mainstream, we’ll eventually run into the same issue. My solution for the Olympics introduces new modifications, or even new events entirely. Why watch the same thing every 4 years when new obstacles and challenges can be created to entertain the audience? Many might argue that changing the games will ruin the careers of athletes and trainers, along with the integrity of the sport. However, the Olympics and any competition for that matter are in the business of entertainment. If you can’t keep viewers glued to the screen, in awe of amazing competition, it’s time to switch it up. But Derek Han from San Jose, Calif. , thinks technology will allow humans to surpass what the authors call “Peak Olympics”: I think that humans are not at their peak in many sports. The authors are arguing that because the difference in performance times are becoming smaller and smaller, the athletes seem to be reaching a peak performance level at which they will no longer be able to improve, or will only be able to improve through improved technology. I completely disagree with this for multiple reasons. From what I’ve seen, athletes are getting more and more skilled. For my example, I’ll use running. Specifically, the mile run. In 1855, the first recorded mile time record on a track was set, with a time of 4:28:00. That’s ridiculously slow for a professional. Even my friend can run a mile faster than that. By 1886, the mile record had dropped to 4:12:75. From 1945 to 1954, the record had been 4:01:40, until it was broken with a time of 3:59:40. From 1855 to 1954, the record has gone down by 29 seconds. Now, the record stands at 3:43:13. In 64 years, the record has gone down by 16 seconds. Between 1954 and 2018, the record has gone down by an average of four seconds per year, while between 1855 and 1954, the record has gone down by an average of 3.41 seconds. The athletes in this case are actually improving more quickly as time goes by, rather than plateauing. With the new technology that is being made, athletes aren’t getting an unfair advantage to boost their performance, athletes are actually improving the same amount as they did back in the 1850s, when track spikes were first being produced. _________ Image Credit Illustrations by Kaye Blegvad Our Picture Prompt for “ Valentine’s Day ” brought out both the lovers and the cynics. Monalene Delo from Wilmington, N.C. , likes what this holiday stands for: I love Valentine’s Day! It is the one day of the year where love, joy and cheer is spread and the focus is simply love. Often times in this world where there is so much hate, we need a reminder to be good to one another. To spread love. This holiday provides a time to support others in ways that they normally wouldn’t. For instance at school students might spend a day making valentines for friends and family. Just by making a simple card people on the receiving end feel appreciated and loved. Significant others may even go out of their way to make sure their spouses have a wonderful day, by buying candies, cards and stuffed animals. This day promotes friendships and joy. It encourages you to do something nice for others, like making a Valentine’s Day card for someone in a nursing home that may have lost their loved one. I think it is a beautiful reminder to be good to one another. Valentine’s Day is not about the materialistic things. On Valentine’s Day I saw big bears, candies and flowers lining the halls as gifts to their girlfriends, how happy it made them. Here’s the thing, flowers will die and the chocolate candies will get eaten, then what is left? When there is no more presents being given, no more cards to show how much you care. Will we still spread love and kindness? I hope that we continue to even after the day ends. Timosha Fesenko from Rhode Island does not: I remember Valentine’s Day before high school when kids were more interested in getting their sugar fix then finding a Valentine. Now? I would only take part in Valentine’s Day if I were in a relationship. If not, I don’t believe anything I’d do would be very genuine, which is the main reason I’m not a fan of Valentine’s Day. If you love someone, or want to ask them out on a date or something, why wait until Valentine’s Day? Most others are doing the exact same thing, so why not do it when no one else is? Jeraldyn Ramirez from Rhode Island thinks Valentine’s Day is about more than just romantic love: Valentine’s Day is another excuse to dress up and eat dinner. I love Valentine’s Day because it is a day for you to eat as much candy without being judged, although I eat it no matter what day it is. I don’t hate this holiday because it is just another day to show your love and appreciation for the people around you. I think the reason why many people dislike the holiday is because of the assumption that you need to be in a relationship to enjoy it. This is not the case, however, because it is just a day about love. To prove this assumption wrong, we can look at the name for Valentine’s Day in Spanish that some use to refer to it, being “Dia de la Amistad”. This means the day of friendship. I apply this definition to celebrate the holiday. I make plans with my friends and go out for a meal. Kerly3D from YC CLIP agreed: I think Valentine’s Day is a perfect day to show others how much you love them. It is not necessary to be in a relationship because you can show love to your parents, family or friends. Most people confuse this day with giving gifts and spending a lot of money, but it is not about that, a person can make happy another by sharing, treating and giving love and happiness on this day. I know some people do not agree with me, and maybe they think that we can share and give love every day, but I think it is good, at least one day, remembering with more emphasis the meaning of the love. But Marcelo3D from YC CLIP said it had become too commercialized: In my opinion, Valentine’s Day is an amazing day for the couples and for friends but I do not really care so much this day. I think that this day is a commercial day, created so that couples spend money on gifts but is not a bad day because in this day, many couples forgot their problems for one day and they concentrate on having the best day. Another thing that you can do in this day is spend time with your family and this is a good point for this day because not every day we can see all of our familiars and this is a good day to see them. Maddie Leber from Wilmington, N.C ., noticed her feelings have changed as she has gotten older: I always remember loving Valentine’s Day when I was little, but let’s be honest. It was a day where everyone in your class would give you cards and candy and you barely did any work, but over the years I’ve grown to resent it. Now it’s just another day where people are walking around holding bears with hearts and chocolate prices sky-rocket. I had always believed Valentine’s Day was a day only for people in love, and if you didn’t have a significant other then you weren’t included. I’ve now realized it’s just a day to let people know you love them. This is the first year I’ve celebrated Valentine’s Day since those days in elementary school where I would give out those little cards with puppies on them that came with stickers. This year I’ve made cards for everyone in my family and plan on buying candy for my friends, but not until tomorrow, because then it’s half-off. And Gloria3D from YC CLIP believes love should be celebrated all year round: Valentine’s Day is s day for the commercial business because if you see the season in February after Christmas the sales are low. Them the commerce need to activate and what better way than create a day for in love. For you demonstrate to someone that you have any love feeling for this person not necessary have that it is this day every day, every moment you can do it. Personally I every day I say my daughters, my husband and other person during the day “I love you”, not necessary with words almost with attitudes. I give them a hug, biscuits, hot chocolate or simply you say them something beautiful. You can use this way. You do not want the commercial day for you say, “you are important for me”.
