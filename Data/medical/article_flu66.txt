But the creative team is now engaged in revamping a show that was essentially judged confusing and unfunny. Both a new beginning and a new ending went in this week, and apparently a lot of stuff in between, too. The new ending is meant to augment the Pirandellian strain in the show, which is about mistaken racial identities and is based on the real-life fracas that erupted when a non-Asian actor, Jonathan Pryce, was cast in the role of a Eurasian pimp in "Miss Saigon." "Face Value" takes place on opening night of a musical called "The Real Manchu," in which a white actor, Bernard Sugarmann (played by Mark Linn Baker), has been cast in the title role. As initially staged, a character is shot at the end of the show, but in the revisions, the actors in the play ("Face Value," that is, not "The Real Manchu") decide onstage that that's the wrong ending and enact another one. Last week in Boston, the show's grosses dropped to about $80,000 in a 1,600-seat house, perhaps half of what's needed to break even, prompting speculation that the show would be delayed on its road to New York or close altogether. Mr. Rudin insisted, however, there was no doubt that the show would come to New York on schedule. Previews are to begin March 9 at the Cort Theater.  Reason for a Playwright to Relax   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Someone is watching over Frank McGuinness. A Dubliner, the 40-year-old playwright was in New York this week for the first time since the shaky opening of his hostage drama, "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me," in November, having missed the general speculation that the show wouldn't last through the doldrums of January.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       "The last time was horrendous," said Mr. McGuinness, who, over wine and cigarettes, spoke about the pressure of a Broadway opening. "It was the first time in my life I took Valium. And I can tell you it doesn't work." He appears much more at ease now, part of the reason being that his play, which did not earn back its weekly expenses of $110,000 in previews or at the beginning of its run, has begun to repay its investors and is now looking to recoup its $850,000 capitalization by the summer. Weekly grosses at the Booth Theater have stabilized in the neighborhood of $145,000 to $150,000, and for the past month or so, said Thomas P. Santopietro, the company manager, advance ticket sales have held around $250,000. Those connected with the show, which was reviewed respectfully, speak about its being "an audience play" whose fortunes turned around on the basis of good word of mouth. But two fortuitous occurrences undoubtedly helped. The show was probably saved when the Shubert Organization lost the competition for Tony Kushner's "Angels in America," for which the Shuberts had offered the Booth, perhaps its prime theater. Then came the unexpected success of "The Crying Game," the Neil Jordan film starring Stephen Rea, who is also in "Someone." On Feb. 17, the day after the film received six Academy Award nominations, including one for Mr. Rea for best actor, $40,000 worth of tickets were sold to the play, up from a daily average of $28,000. Mr. Rea's contract expires this spring, and the producers are currently negotiating with him in hopes of extending it. It has already been announced that on April 6, Alec McCowen will leave the cast and be replaced by Michael York. Mr. McGuinness, a round and rumpled man who teaches literature at Maynooth College outside Dublin, said one reason the play had fared better on Broadway than it did in the West End of London last fall was that American audiences were more open to it. His theory is that Americans, conditioned by their boisterous native musicals, approach a night in the theater as a liberating night on the town; they're ready for anything. "They want to laugh, they want to cry," he said. "The English were ready to cry at this play. I'm not sure they were ready to laugh." Mr. McGuinness said the play, about three men being held in a cell by terrorists in the Middle East and how they cope with not knowing when, or if, they'll be released, owes a debt to Beckett, particularly Beckett's fascination with the passage of time and the relationship between the time that passes in a play and the real time that passes for the audience in the theater. "I'm an Irishman," Mr. McGuinness said. "After Beckett, nothing in the theater was the same, particularly for Irish playwrights. He gave me license to write about time."

The roles are currently being filled, respectively, by Mr. McCowen, Mr. Rea and James McDaniel.

"One way of doing this was by chaining the characters to a wall, so all they had was language. I'd read accounts in the paper that English and Irish were being chained together, and that interested me, a situation in which warring people had to get along. It's not an accident that in my play the American and the Irishman form an immediate affinity." Of course, chaining characters to a wall is restrictive, not just for actors but for a playwright. This was a challenge Mr. McGuinness said he took on purposely. "You have to be at the peak of sharpness; you have to write good one-liners," said Mr. McGuinness, an admitted fan of television sitcoms like "Cheers" and "Murphy Brown." He added, "I didn't read every play by Neil Simon for nothing." Ailing Scott Due Back Tonight George C. Scott, who is currently starring Off Broadway in "Wrong Turn at Lungfish," has missed all four performances of the play since it opened on Sunday. He had been suffering from a slight case of flu, and earlier this week, complaining of chest pains, he was examined by a doctor and given an electrocardiogram. The play's producer, James B. Freydberg, said yesterday that the condition of the 65-year-old Mr. Scott, who has a history of heart problems, including at least one bypass operation, is not serious. By yesterday morning, the chest pains had disappeared, Mr. Freydberg said, adding that Mr. Scott expected to be back onstage, in the role of Peter Ravenswaal, a blind and dying hospital patient, tonight. In the interim, Mr. Scott's pajamas have been filled by Stephen Pearlman. Tale of a Replacement Replaced A small but cruel story of theater fate: When Peter Bartlett replaced Edward Hibbert in a featured role as an interior decorator in Paul Rudnick's audacious comedy about AIDS, "Jeffrey," it was with the understanding that the show was set for a limited run at the WPA Theater. "Jeffrey," of course, turned out to be a surprise hit, and is moving to the Minetta Lane Theater for an open-ended commercial run, beginning March 6. But even though he was critically praised, Mr. Bartlett will not be in the cast. Exercising a right guaranteed by Actors Equity, which says that in the case of such a move, the original actor must be offered the role if he has not been absent from it for more than four weeks, Mr. Hibbert, who had been cast in "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," in Los Angeles, has elected to return to "Jeffrey" instead. "My heart was really back in New York," Mr. Hibbert said. "So I told the producers: 'I wish I could say I'd stay and be a part of 'Joseph,' but 'Jeffrey' is becoming something everyone's loving as much as I do. I'm going to follow my heartstrings and go back to it.' They very graciously let me out of my contract." He returned to New York this week, he said, and planned to write a note to Mr. Bartlett as soon as he finished unpacking. "I can understand," an obviously disappointed Mr. Bartlett said. "All actors should have a sign painted in large letters: 'There's little justice in life and less in the theater.' " He said he hoped to be offered the role in Los Angeles, if and when a company was formed there. "In the meantime, I have a commercial running for golf shoes. That'll keep me in brown rice."
