Edsall  DEC. 23, 2015       Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story             “I’m so tired of this politically correct crap,” Donald Trump told a cheering audience of South Carolina business leaders in September. “That’s called politicians’ speak.” Opposition to political correctness has always been a weapon brandished by the right against what it sees as “multicultural” liberalism, but Trump has taken this to new extremes . Trump’s assault on political correctness has even attracted the attention of Kenny Rogers , the country-and-western singer, who appeared slightly embarrassed to admit how drawn he was to Trump: I really like him. I think his problem is that he says what everyone wants to hear, but he doesn’t say it well. I love what he says, I have to admit. Trump’s resounding success with the reckless abandonment of the norms of political discourse suggests that he has tapped into a deep reservoir of antipathy to the culture of polite restraint. Polls show that hostility to political correctness is widespread among voters. On Oct. 30, Fairleigh Dickinson University released the results of a survey that asked 1,026 adults “Please tell me if you agree or disagree with the following statement: A big problem this country has is being politically correct.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Over all, 68 percent agreed that political correctness was a big problem, including 62 percent of self-identified Democrats, 68 percent of independents and 81 percent of Republicans. These views cut across racial lines. Seventy-two percent of whites and 61 percent of nonwhites (mostly African-American and Hispanic) describe political correctness as a big problem. A Rasmussen pol l in August found that 71 percent of 1,000 adults surveyed agreed with the statement that political correctness was “a problem in America today.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       This poll data indicates that even members of racial and ethnic minorities who are protected by speech codes as well as by the suppression of offensive  language are hostile to political correctness. This does not mean that majorities of all political persuasions agree with Trump’s allegation that Mexican immigrants are “ criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc. ” — or that voters are comfortable with women being referred to as “ fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals ,” as Trump put it. President Obama has been prescient in his critiques of political correctness, but his remarks have been empathetic rather than hostile and have done little to defuse the issue. In a March 2008 campaign speech at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Barack Obama, then a candidate, said: Most working- and middle-class white Americans don’t feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience – as far as they’re concerned, no one’s handed them anything, they’ve built it from scratch. They’ve worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor. They are anxious about their futures, and feel their dreams slipping away; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. Obama then noted the consequences: So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear that an African-American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they’re told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time. Obama also made a point about the political importance of what is said behind closed doors: Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren’t always expressed in polite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. Just this past September, Obama was more explicit in his criticism of political correctness on the nation’s campuses in a speech at the North High School in Des Moines: I’ve heard of some college campuses where they don’t want to have a guest speaker who is too conservative. Or they don’t want to read a book if it has language that is offensive to African-Americans, or somehow sends a demeaning signal towards women. And I’ve got to tell you, I don’t agree with that either. I don’t agree that you, when you become students at colleges, have to be coddled and protected from different points of views. Obama’s remarks and Trump’s comments after supporters beat up a Black Lives Matter protester at a rally in Birmingham in November — “ Maybe he should have been roughed up ” – reflect the gulf between the two men. The Fairleigh-Dickenson poll suggests that liberals who seek to defend speech codes and trigger warnings , especially in schools and colleges, have ventured onto politically hazardous terrain. Anecdotal evidence of this tension abounds. On Jan. 27, Joan Walsh, editor at large of Salon, the liberal web publication, wrote “ When ‘political correctness’ hurts .” In it, she attacked Jonathan Chait, who had published a critique of political correctness in New York magazine.

Credit Carlo Allegri/Reuters    Chait, himself a liberal, wrote: Liberals believe (or ought to believe) that social progress can continue while we maintain our traditional ideal of a free political marketplace where we can reason together as individuals. Political correctness challenges that bedrock liberal ideal. While politically less threatening than conservatism (the far right still commands far more power in American life), the p.c. left is actually more philosophically threatening. It is an undemocratic creed. Walsh’s counterattack: Chait continues to pick the scab of his suffering over the fact that the every musing of white liberal men (and women, to be fair) about race and politics is no longer welcomed for its contribution to the struggle. His “tone,” Walsh wrote, of grievance and self-importance, as though he’s warning us of a threat to our democracy that others can’t see or are too intimidated to fight, makes it very hard to parse. Salon published 312 comments on Walsh’s critique of Chait. Almost all of them were written by men and women on the left side of the political spectrum   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Despite Salon’s progressive credentials, critics of political correctness substantially outnumbered defenders. Here’s a sampling of the majority view: “AtheistLiberal” wrote: “P.C. culture deserves to be mocked because it is so pathetic. How pointing this out makes Chait look weak is beyond me.” Another asked: “How can we be equal if I’m constantly being told that my white male privilege blinds me and poisons my every thought?” “GWnNWJ” joined the fray: The surest and best way to continue to guarantee that working class white voters continue to support Republican candidates, even if it is against their economic self-interest, is to indulge in identity politics. The Chait vs. Walsh dispute crystallizes the conflict between those who feel that politically correct norms defy common sense and those who feel that such norms are essential to the empowerment of individuals and groups previously barred from full participation in society. Regardless of the outcome next November, Trump’s success in raising the issue of political correctness creates uncertainty in the 2016 election. How many Democratic and independent voters share Trump’s implicit racial antipathy to the Black Lives Matter movement? How many worry that the police have backed off law enforcement in response to the so-called Ferguson effect , with a resulting increase in crime? And how many are offended by the concessions of university administrators to demands for speech codes, trigger warnings, “safe spaces” and even resignations ?

The odds still favor a Hillary Clinton victory, but the issue of political correctness is particularly treacherous for the Democratic Party and liberalism. Since 1964, the Democratic Party has served as the political home of the major rights revolutions — civil and voting rights for racial and ethnic minorities, criminal defendants’ rights, women’s rights, reproductive rights, gay rights, rights to sexual privacy. Each of these revolutions has changed the moral order and norms of permissible language — including, for example, the substitution of humankind for mankind and the now common usage of Ms. At the same time, for a longer period, liberal ideology has been the mainstay of support for First Amendment rights and opposition to censorship. Trump’s chances of winning the nomination remain slim. Even as he has stirred powerful undercurrents in American politics, he has done so in ways that make him unacceptable to the majority of the electorate.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   He has highlighted — and profited from — irreconcilable ideological contradictions within both the left and the right. If the American political system were more receptive to such a development, his campaign could have laid the groundwork for the creation of a third party.   Trump has reframed core questions in ways that make them dangerous, both for the candidates and for the country as a whole. He has fractured the Republican coalition and exacerbated fissures in the Democratic Party. Chances are that the severity of Republican divisions will ease pressure on the Democrats to remedy intraparty conflicts, at least for now. While Trump may push his luck too far and go down in flames, the consequences of his bid — and the incendiary anger he has released — have proved unpredictable throughout this campaign and will remain so until Nov. 8th and probably beyond. In that sense, it doesn’t matter whether he ends up as a winner or his least favorite thing, a loser.   This is an article from Campaign Stops at nytimes.com/campaignstops.
