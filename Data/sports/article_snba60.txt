J. Hunter, the American shot-putter and husband of Marion Jones, who tested positive for a steroid four times last summer, announced his decision to retire yesterday rather than contest the results of the drug tests in arbitration. In light of his decision, Hunter was barred from competition for two years -- the standard punishment given steroid users by track and field's international governing body -- preventing him from rescinding his retirement any time soon. Hunter, the 1999 world champion, did not compete at the Olympics last year in Sydney, Australia, after undergoing knee surgery. When word surfaced during the Games that he had tested positive at four European track meets and that no announcement had been made, the resulting furor further called into question the resolve of officials to catch drug cheats. Several athletes also said publicly that they would be suspicious of the performances of Jones, who won three gold medals and two bronzes. She passed all of her drug tests in Sydney.

A number of athletes have tested positive for nandrolone in the past two years and have said they might have taken improperly labeled or contaminated nutritional supplements.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       In retiring, Hunter continued to protest his innocence, saying in a letter to USA Track and Field, the sport's national governing body, that he ''vehemently denies knowingly taking any banned substance.''

Olympic sports operate according to the principle known as strict liability, meaning that athletes are held responsible for taking illicit performance-enhancing substances regardless of how they enter the body. Also, American Olympic athletes are repeatedly warned by officials not to take nutritional supplements, precisely because they could be mislabeled. When Hunter's failed drug tests were first reported in a Sydney newspaper, it sparked a controversy among American and international track officials. The International Amateur Athletics Federation, track and field's world governing body, accused USA Track and Field of covering up drug tests. In response, USA Track and Field said that it had never been notified that Hunter's tests had been declared positive by the I.A.A.F., which conducted the tests. ''The notion that we covered up tests is absurd; it was their tests,'' Craig Masback, the chief operating officer of USA Track and Field, said in an interview last night. American track officials have suggested since Sydney that the I.A.A.F. appeared to violate its own rules, which call for the immediate suspension of an athlete once the A sample tests positive. Each urine sample is divided into an A sample and a B sample for testing purposes. Hunter was not immediately suspended, leading to speculation that a deal had been made by the I.A.A.F. not to announce the test results until after the Olympics, presumably to avoid embarrassing Jones. Jones was seeking to win an unprecedented five gold medals in the women's competition.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
