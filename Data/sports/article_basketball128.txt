Credit Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times     CLASON POINT, in the southeastern Bronx , is arguably the least known of a trio of peninsulas that jut into the East River across from Rikers Island and La Guardia Airport. Of the other two, Hunts Point is the city’s food distribution hub and Ferry Point received some attention recently when it was discussed as the site of a new public golf course operated by one of Donald Trump’s companies. A drive through the nearly one-square-mile area makes it clear that anonymity is just fine with the people who live there. Most properties, no matter how close to their neighbors, are fenced in; few people are seen on the streets; and the loudest noise comes from airplanes flying so low on approach to La Guardia that airline logos are easily made out from the ground. Residents live with the roar of jet engines because they value the neighborhood’s reasonably priced real estate, the parking that can be readily found on the street, and — when the weather doesn’t turn traitor the way it did last week with Hurricane Sandy — the views over the water.

Residential areas lie to either side.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Without a link to the subway, Clason Point seems isolated. But it also has a quirkiness derived from its early 1900s past as a resort. One vestige of that is Harding Park, a subneighborhood along the waterfront, made up of 236 former summer bungalows, now weatherized for year-round living. Of course, no amount of weatherizing could have protected against the recent stormwaters, and Elbin Mena, the president of the homeowners association for Harding Park, noted on Tuesday that about a dozen homes in its southernmost section had been flooded. Elsewhere in the larger neighborhood, trees were down and there was scattered power loss, he said, adding that neighbors were doing what they could to help one another in the aftermath. According to census data on the population of Community Board 9, of which Clason Point is a part, almost 58 percent are Hispanic and 30 percent are black or African-American, with whites and Asians splitting the rest. Harry Rodriguez, a court officer in Criminal Court in the Bronx, moved into his Harding Park bungalow with his wife, Angie, four years ago after originally searching in Warwick, a community in Orange County where the properties are big and the prices lower than those in New York City . Mr. Rodriguez said he fell for the locale right away. But when he took his wife for the first time, “she said absolutely not.” The house needed a lot of work and was very small.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Then she saw what Mr. Mena, of the homeowner association, had done with his property, and she changed her mind. She was impressed with his back deck — a wide wooden expanse with a bar, umbrellas, a fountain, a dock, and Manhattan ’s skyline in the distance. Since the Rodriguezes bought the bungalow a few doors down from Mr. Mena’s place, they have slowly updated it and are now adding a room. WHAT YOU’LL FIND Homes in Harding Point do not come up for sale often because families tend to hold onto them, brokers say. Just outside Harding Park is a newer development, Harbour Pointe at Shorehaven, a private gated community of 488 modest condos and 156 two-family homes built on the site of a former beach club. This development started to go up in the late 1980s and has continued in phases. Most recently, ground was broken for 71 two-family homes near Clason Point Park, where Soundview Avenue dead-ends at the water. Rafael Torres of Team Tower Realty, the exclusive broker for Harbour Pointe, said people who bought there are teachers, nurses, police officers and other civil servants who like the security and resortlike amenities that the development offers. Contrasting the Bronx’s vibrant, busy reputation with Shorehaven’s quiet, insular one, Mr. Torres said, “A lot of people talk about the Bronx, but life here is not like that.” Each unit comes with a parking spot; visitors must be announced at the gatehouse; and residents have access to basketball courts, a gym, a swimming pool and a day care center, he said. Outside of Harbour Point and Harding Park, the housing consists mainly of brick duplexes and single-family homes on side streets that intersect with Soundview Avenue and White Plains Road.

Buyers are often young couples looking for their first home or people who have rented in the area and who now want to own, he said.

He has a listing for a two-unit attached home in Shorehaven built in 2002. It has a two-bedroom apartment over a three-bedroom duplex and is priced at $500,000. He said a similar property in the Throgs Neck neighborhood of the Bronx would probably sell for $700,000. According to the real estate Web site Trulia.com, which aggregates multiple listings, 218 properties were for sale in Clason Point the last week of October. An overview of market trends on the site said the average sale price of houses for a two-month period ending Sept. 12 was $334,000, a decline of 33.4 percent when compared with average sales in the neighborhood in 2007. But Mr. Fernandez has noticed the market picking up. “Inventory is being consumed faster than even a year ago,” he said. “It now moves in four to six months, which is almost a real market, while we used to see 10 to 12 months.” “It’s urban but not as urban as the rest of the Bronx,” Mr. Fernandez said. “You don’t see high-rises, and it’s not like you’re in the middle of the Grand Concourse and you can’t park. Living here, you find parking everywhere.” Mr. Rodriguez bought his Harding Point bungalow for $250,000 four years ago. After renovations, he said, it recently was appraised at $370,000. At Harbor Pointe, two-bedroom condos sell for $340,000 to $375,000, three-bedrooms for about $475,000, Mr. Torres said. Owners also pay a monthly condo fee ranging from $275 to $359.

People also fish from the rocks at Clason Point Park or off a jetty that can be reached from the Harding Point area. Clason Point encompasses Soundview Park , which is at the confluence of the Bronx and East Rivers. The park has sports fields and more places to fish. For shopping, Bruckner Plaza, with big retailers like Kmart, Old Navy and Toys ‘R’ Us, is a short bus ride or drive up White Plains Road. THE SCHOOLS A longtime neighborhood institution is the Holy Cross Parish Elementary School, which serves students through eighth grade. Public School 69 New Vision School , with 575 students, received an A on its most recent city progress report. The larger P.S. 182, which has 900 students, scored a B. A nearby option for older students is the Adlai E. Stevenson educational campus, which houses two middle schools and seven small high schools. THE COMMUTE With no direct subway service, residents who take public transportation rely on two bus lines. The BX27 takes riders to the 6 train at the Morrison/Soundview Avenues stop, while the BX39 connects to the 6 at the Westchester Avenue/E 177th Street stop. At rush hour, it can take about an hour to get to Grand Central Terminal. THE HISTORY In the early part in the 20th century, Clason Point had dance halls, bathing piers and Kane’s Casino, according to the Encyclopedia of New York City. Its popularity waned when the last ferry service from College Point, Queens , ended during World War II . After the war, the casino property was converted into the Shorehaven Beach Club, a private club with a saltwater swimming pool, tennis and handball courts and live entertainment. Pat Loehmann, 68, who has lived in Clason Point her whole life, remembers sneaking into Shorehaven to swim in the pool and later working there as a teenager. She said children used to play outside until the streetlights came on. These days, she said, it is quieter. Looking out the window of her Beach Avenue home, which was once her grandmother’s, she said, “The kids don’t go out.”   A version of this article appears in print on November 4, 2012, on Page RE7 of the New York edition with the headline: No Nonsense, on Prices or Parking.
