STEWART    DEC. 21, 2012      Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           After Apple introduced its iPhone 5 in China last week, Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, hailed the rollout as the company’s most successful ever, with two million handsets sold the first weekend. It’s the kind of news that in the past has sent Apple stock soaring. This time investors fled. Apple stock dropped 4 percent the day of the China event, hitting a 10-month low. What’s happened to many investors’ favorite stock? Apple is still the world’s largest company by market capitalization by a comfortable margin, and shareholders can hardly complain: even after last week’s decline, its shares have gained 28 percentthis year through Friday, compared with 15 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. But since reaching a peak above $700 in September, Apple shares are now barely above $500 — deep into bear market territory — and their luster has dimmed. Apple’s situation is one of the topics I wrote about this year that warrant an update as the year ends. In February, I pointed out that Apple’s huge market capitalization and exponential growth might cause it to confront the law of large numbers, which posits that variables — in this case, exceptional share gains — tend to revert to a mean. That seemed to hit a raw nerve with Apple enthusiasts, and many responded with furious e-mails.

Of 57 Wall Street analysts covering the company, 52 rated it a buy or strong buy in February, and only one — Edward Zabitsky, the chief executive and founder of ACI Research in Toronto — rated it a sell. Mr. Zabitsky specializes in telecommunications and has been something of a Cassandra about Apple for years. He’s a favorite target of the Web’s “iPhone death watch,” which takes aim at anyone who questions the Apple juggernaut.

People make fun of things they don’t understand. I guess it made them feel better to insult someone like me. But the factors I warned about have been coming to the fore. People are starting to understand what I’m saying.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       What he’s been saying is that Samsung has surpassed Apple as the leading handset maker; apps have become more important than the devices that carry them; and handsets are increasingly being evaluated on their ability to access the cloud and interact with other devices — trends that he believes put Apple at a long-term disadvantage. “When I predicted Samsung would be the market leader in unit sales, people wanted to sue me for slander,” Mr. Zabitsky said. “But Samsung has not only surpassed Apple in sales, it’s out-innovating Apple. Have you seen the new Galaxy Note II? It’s amazing.” And Apple’s stumble over its maps application for the iPhone 5, which led to a rare apology in September, illustrated both the growing power of apps and the company’s fallibility. Mr. Zabitsky said he didn’t fault Apple for developing its own maps app, but criticizes its decision to supplant Google Maps on the iPhone 5. “It wasn’t ready for prime time,” he said of Apple’s version. (Google said iPhone users downloaded 10 million copies of Google maps app for the iPhone in just 48 hours after it became available last week.) Of course, the recent slide in Apple’s shares could turn out to be a rare buying opportunity, a mere blip in the stock’s rise to new heights. Fifty of 57 analysts still rate it a strong buy or buy, and Mr. Zabitsky remains the lone analyst with a sell recommendation. His target price is $270, unchanged since February. “The trends I’ve mentioned still haven’t played out,” he said. “I know people don’t want to hear that, but my job as an analyst isn’t to make people feel good.”  Photo         Credit CHINATOPIX, via Associated Press    ‘THE VOICE’ There were plenty of skeptics when NBC introduced its singing competition “The Voice” in April 2011. No wonder: NBC was the long-struggling fourth-place network, and the reality-competition juggernaut “American Idol” on Fox was firmly ensconced at the top of the ratings, with Simon Cowell’s hotly anticipated “X-Factor” waiting in the wings. “The Voice” proved a surprise hit, displacing “Idol” last March as network television’s No. 1 show. But even then, critics dismissed it as a fluke that benefited from the halo effect of the Super Bowl , which ran on NBC. And some TV executives ridiculed NBC’s decision to use “The Voice” as a lead-in for a new dramatic series, “Smash,” about the making of a Broadway musical, which they deemed too sophisticated to appeal to a broad network audience. NBC executives were cautious. “We’re not going to move to second place, let alone first, just on this show,” Steve Burke, NBCUniversal ’s chief executive, told me in March .

Against long odds, and thanks in large part to “The Voice,” NBC was the No. 1 network during the November ratings sweeps for viewers 11 to 49 years old, the group most sought-after by advertisers. NBC had a 23 percent gain in viewers compared to a decline at every other network. NBC has now been the top network for viewers 11 to 49 for 10 of the last 12 weeks, something that hadn’t happened in nearly a decade. NBC executives are pinching themselves. “We were a distant fourth last year,” Bob Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment, told me just before “The Voice” finale. “We would have been happy to be a solid No. 3. To be No. 1 or tied for No. 1 every week, that’s almost unbelievable.” NBC has made the most of “The Voice’s” visibility to introduce new shows. The critically acclaimed “Smash” is returning for a second season in February after defying skeptics and emerging last season in a tie for the top-rated drama in its 10 p.m. time slot. And NBC has used “The Voice” to expose audiences to its shows “Revolution” and “Go On,” which are this season’s No. 1 new drama and comedy. Two other new shows, “Chicago Fire” and “The New Normal,” have also performed well. “ ‘The Voice’ has done exactly what we hoped for and more,” Mr. Greenblatt said.  Photo         Credit John Van Beekum for The New York Times    Can NBC sustain its newfound success? Next year the network is producing two cycles of “The Voice,” leading to concerns about overexposure. And because of scheduling issues, it’s tampering with the formula, shuffling its popular hosts and adding the pop stars Usher and Shakira to the lineup. But Mr. Greenblatt is confident the show’s producer, Mark Burnett, a reality TV legend, can pull off the balancing act. “We’re very mindful that we don’t want to kill the goose,” Mr. Greenblatt said. REPLACEMENTS LTD. Bob Page, the gay North Carolina entrepreneur who transformed an interest in flea markets into an $80 million-a-year used-tableware business, Replacements Ltd., had despaired of ever being able to marry in his home state. After his company openly opposed a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage — the only company in North Carolina that did — angry customers wrote e-mails and letters and said they would never buy from his company again. Others at the company worried about his safety . In May, North Carolina voters overwhelmingly approved the ban, now enshrined in the state’s constitution. But since word of his stand and the hostile reaction spread, Mr. Page said, he has received over 5,000 e-mails and letters, nearly all of them positive, and has replied to almost all of them. “I’ve been amazed,” he said recently. “We’ve literally had responses from all over the world, as far away as Hong Kong. People have written to say they’re leaving their china and silver to us in their wills. A woman in San Francisco, who isn’t gay, placed a $20,000 order.” Even a best-selling novelist took up the cause: “Anne Rice put us on her Facebook page, and she has over 600,000 followers. Our sales had been a little lackluster, but now business is up substantially.” Even so, “life isn’t about money,” Mr. Page said, adding that he’s “elated” over the nationwide advance of the cause he supported. In November, voters in four states backed gay marriage. In contrast to what happened in North Carolina, major corporations like Amazon, Starbucks and Nike backed the campaigns. In May, President Obama became the first president to support gay marriage. Mr. Page, his partner, Dale Frederiksen, and their twin sons were invited to a White House Christmas party. And this month, the Supreme Court agreed to hear cases challenging the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which deprives married gay couples of federal benefits and recognition, and Proposition 8, which bans gay marriage in California. “I’m thrilled and I’m scared to death,” Mr. Page said of the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the cases. “I’ve done a lot of reading and in my heart, I think Justice Kennedy will do the right thing.” (Justice Anthony Kennedy is widely perceived as a potential swing vote on the issue.) “He wrote the opinion that overturned the anti-sodomy laws, and that gives me great hope.” Should the Supreme Court rule that state bans on gay marriage are unconstitutional, it might mean that Mr. Page and Mr. Frederiksen can be married in North Carolina. “That may be too much to hope for,” Mr. Page said. “But the country is moving forward. I know we’ll get there.”   A version of this article appears in print on December 22, 2012, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Revisiting Apple, NBC And Gay Marriage.
