He would be exonerated, and he would work to save other wrongfully convicted people. He would fulfill his lifelong dream to open a men’s clothing store. He would live in a sprawling home with a swimming pool and a basketball court. Somehow, even as 12 years passed, it all felt possible. “Isn’t it so crazy that everything happened?” he said recently, sitting in the lounge of his men’s wear store in Cedar Hill, the Dallas suburb. He used the money he received from the state as compensation for his wrongful conviction to open Christopher’s Men’s Wear, in the Uptown Village at Cedar Hill on Black Friday 2011, two years after his release from prison. He designed the store like his walk-in closet, where it is easy to mix and match while browsing through racks of suits, sweaters, dress shirts and sportswear. In 1997, Mr. Scott, then 27, was convicted of capital murder. A woman whose husband was shot dead by men who were burglarizing their home identified him in a police lineup after he and a friend (his co-defendant) were arrested. There was no physical evidence; the prosecutors relied on eyewitness testimony to convict him. The judge sentenced him to life in prison, effectively ending the life he knew.

It was an affront to a man who always took pride in his appearance, but he tried to maintain his sense of personal style. On weeks when his family would visit, Mr. Scott mixed starch and water and toweled it onto his uniform to smooth the fabric and crease the pant legs. Once it dried, he folded it neatly and slept on it to secure the creases.

At his exoneration hearing, about a dozen visitors, all exonerated men from Dallas County, sat together, wearing suits, polished shoes and diamond jewelry. The spiffy look is unique to the Dallas group, according to Karen Wolff, a social worker with the Innocence Project. “That’s just who they are; they’re just regal,” Ms. Wolff said. Seeing the men, she added, is “like you walked into some kind of conference for large, snappy-dressed black men. It’s a sight.” Johnnie Lindsey, now one of Mr. Scott’s close friends, was among the exonerated at his hearing. His style is more conservative; it’s “old school” and Ivy League, he said. After 26 years in prison, dressing well, for him, means feeling proud. And with the state compensation provided to exonerated prisoners, he and the others can afford nice clothing. (Mr. Scott’s store offers a 20 percent discount to exonerated men). “Most of the guys know, whenever we have an engagement and we all have to be there, everyone is dressed properly,” Mr. Lindsey said. Mr. Scott’s store is both a convenience and a physical reminder of the group’s expectations. They have an image to uphold, and it’s not that of criminals.

Credit Cord McPhail for The Texas Tribune    Dr. Jaimie Page, co-director of the Texas Exoneree Project and a social work professor, said that as more exonerations took place and the group became a brotherhood, fashion became part of their culture. “Part of it is very deep and meaningful, and part of it is fun,” Ms. Page said. “It helps with their new identity. It helps with their self-image and self-esteem.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Steven Phillips, another of Mr. Scott’s close friends, was also at his hearing and helped him with money and a place to live after his release. “I always ask him, what are you going to wear, man?” And Mr. Scott will tell him, “casual-nice or casual-sharp” or some other nuanced variation.

It takes time to cope with the effects of wrongful incarceration and to adjust to freedom, yet clothing is easy to change. “When you change the way you look, you will change the way you act,” said Richard Miles, who knew Mr. Scott from their time in prison and who also started his own group, Miles of Freedom, to assist newly released inmates. “We don’t always want to be looked at as exonerees; we want to be looked at as men,” Mr. Scott said. “When we walk into the public eye, I want us to be looking our best.” These men spend a lot of time in the public eye, advocating criminal justice changes in Austin and appearing at every local exoneration hearing. Mr. Scott also started a nonprofit organization, House of Renewed Hope. He focuses mainly on cases like his, in which there is no DNA evidence to disprove the conviction. He believes so strongly in his work to free other innocent prisoners that he has boxes of clothing set aside for them. A. Tiziano, a brand of upscale sportswear that his store carries, donates to his collection. “Not only do I work their cases,” Mr. Scott said, but also “when they get out, I can put some clothes on their back.”   leslie.minora@gmail.com  A version of this article appears in print on November 17, 2013, on Page A29B of the National edition with the headline: Life After Exoneration: Building a Business, And Helping Others.
