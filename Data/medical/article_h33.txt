But the real punch line of this 1978 experiment — “ Pupillary size as an indicator of preference in humor ,” published in the journal Perceptual and Motor Skills — is what became of one of the authors, listed as Sullenberger, C. B. Chesley B. Sullenberger III is the retired airline captain who safely landed US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River in 2009 and the hero of the new Clint Eastwood-directed movie “ Sully .” By virtue of publishing his small experiment, he is also a member of an unusual club. Call it the you’ll-never-guess-who-wrote-that collection of authors of psychology studies.

In between is a gallery of improbable contributors, including politicians on the left and right ( Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Tom DeLay ), actors, a Supreme Court chief justice, three pygmy chimpanzees, and perhaps the greatest power forward in basketball history.

Lilienfeld of Emory University. Several of the weakest papers were by Nobel laureates in other scientific fields, Dr. Lynn and Dr. Lilienfeld found. “Doing psychology well is harder than it looks — that’s certainly one of the takeaways,” Dr. Lynn said. To build their “listicle,” as they call it, Dr. Lynn and Dr. Lilienfeld scoured their own memories of publications over red wine and Italian food. They ran the names by friends and spouses, and measured the level of surprise by the exclamations of “really?” with each author they found. Image Timothy Leary Credit Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Some of the authors, like Richard Alpert (a.k.a. Baba Ram Dass , a counterculture writer) and his colleague Timothy Leary , were psychology professors before they became public figures. Others, like Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and former Education Secretary William Bennett , wrote widely on social issues. Charles Krauthammer, a political columnist, trained in psychiatry at Harvard; his 1978 paper on manias associated with physical illness or drugs has been widely cited in medical literature. Yet most of the papers are like Mr. Sullenberger’s in that they provide fleeting glimpses of the authors’ interests at a particular moment in life, often well before they achieved fame in an unrelated field. In her 1898 paper “Cultivated motor automatism; a study of character in its relation to attention,” the Harvard student Gertrude Stein tested people’s susceptibility to the Ouija board effect , in which subconscious thoughts direct actions.

She later earned a doctorate in neuroscience. The Academy Award-winning actress Natalie Portman was also drawn to brain science as a psychology student at Harvard, and is listed as an author on a 2002 brain imaging study under her given family name, Hershlag.

Dr. Leary is now at Duke. Image Tim Duncan, who retired from the San Antonio Spurs.

In 1968, the journal Science published a paper by the chemist Linus C. Pauling, who received two Nobel Prizes . The paper argued that certain mental disorders, including schizophrenia, were caused in part by vitamin deficiencies. This theory, called “ orthomolecular psychiatry ,” has been discredited.

The article is “rather abstract and opaque,” Dr. Lynn and Dr. Lilienfeld wrote. “In a way, I think of these papers like I do an N.F.L. player with no experience in golf thinking, ‘I’m a great athlete, I should be able to shoot par, no problem,’” Dr. Lynn said in an interview. The pair did not attempt to characterize the contributions of three authors listed by the primatologist Emily Sue Savage-Rumbaugh in a 2007 paper: “Wamba, K., Wamba, P., and Wamba N.” The “Wambas” were bonobos , close cousins of chimpanzees and known for being expressive and sexually active. The paper did note, in passing, that Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh’s was not the only scientific article with an animal co-author: The second author of a 1975 physics paper was one F.D.C. Willard. F.D.C. Willard , as many physics trivia collectors know, was the pen name for Chester, a Siamese cat.
