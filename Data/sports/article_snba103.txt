Nearly 1 in 4 took six, seven or more years to get a diploma, according to the report from the department's Center for Statistics. The study was based on an analysis of college transcripts of 4,400 students who were part of a larger group interviewed in the high school class of 1972. The researchers found that 49 percent earned the bachelor's degree by 1976 in four years. Twenty-seven percent took only one year longer.

Women Ahead of Men  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Women were more likely than men to finish college in four years, 56 percent to 43 percent. Among those who took longer than four years, 70 percent entered college in the fall after high school graduation. Most of the rest started college within three years after graduation. The Center for Statistics issued a brief report on its findings, the latest from a wide range of follow-ups to a continuing study of the class of 1972. It conducted a similar study of thousands of high school sophomores and seniors in 1980. In a separate report, the center said today that high school students who participated in extracurricular activities tended to get good grades. An overwhelming majority of those involved in athletics and other extracurricular activities would not have to forgo after-school activities if a C average was required, it said.

''The more activities students were involved in, the higher they ranked'' on such measures as grades and test scores, the center said. ''Participation in extracurricular activities does not guarantee improved performance as a student,'' the report said. ''What is clear, however, is that extracurricular activities are attracting many bright, high-performing students.'' Thirty-one percent of seniors with a grade point average of 3.5, equivalent to a B+, -or better belonged to the school's student council or a political club, as against 8 percent of those with lower grades.

Many school districts have adopted minimum grade requirements for extracurricular activities in recent years. ''Nearly seven of eight varsity athletes meet or exceed the 2.0 grade point average requirement,'' the study said. ''The groups hardest hit by the requirement are black and Hispanic males. However, about two-thirds of the black and Hispanic male varsity athletes meet the requirement.'' Seventy-nine percent of those studied said they participated in one or more activities, with varsity sports the most popular, 36 percent.
