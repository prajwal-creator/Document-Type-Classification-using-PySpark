Erickson finished a series of alumni meetings Friday.   Credit Michael Appleton for The New York Times     Standing in a hotel ballroom packed with Penn State alumni Friday night, David Roush directed two rapier-sharp questions at the university’s new president, Rodney A. Erickson, that seemed to encapsulate the crowd’s simmering frustration over how the firing of the football coach Joe Paterno was handled. “How soon can we expect to hear these plans to honor Paterno?” Roush, a 2004 graduate, said of the assertion Penn State would pay tribute to Paterno, an 85-year-old with lung cancer. “Or are you and the board of trustees just waiting for a funeral service?” The town hall meeting in Manhattan was the last night in a week filled with such questions for Erickson. After events in Pittsburgh and near Philadelphia, he did not find a more welcoming reception in New York, where he continued his trying introduction to the presidency in the wake of the sexual abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky , a former assistant on the football team. About two months ago, Erickson was an administrator embedded in Penn State’s academic community. Now he is the president charged with navigating Penn State through a crisis, which includes trying to mend relationships with an alumni base upset over Paterno’s firing and the university’s slow response to the allegations against Sandusky. Erickson is trying to do this while also forging a new place for a football program some say grew too mighty.

Spanier, lost their jobs in the wake of the scandal, in which Sandusky has been charged with more than 50 counts of sexual abuse against boys.

But while looking in that rearview, we’ve got to look ahead.” Part of Erickson’s vision for the future is highlighting Penn State’s academic pedigree and research achievements, like university scientists’ recent discovery of a possible cure for leukemia. He also said Penn State would embrace the opportunity to focus on ways to prevent and treat child abuse through financing and faculty research. Yet Erickson’s effort to try to focus the narrative on Penn State’s academic mission will be a challenge at a university where, to many students and alumni, the team’s standing in the Associated Press football poll (unranked) often seems akin to its spot in the rankings of national universities in U.S. News & World Report (tied for 45th). “Our challenge is to have more people understand the academic side of Penn State,” said Erickson, who added that would not mean the diminution of athletics. “Clearly, collegiate football will continue to be a very big and growing market for some time to come.” Erickson is striving to make openness and communication the hallmarks of his administration, with the town hall meetings serving as an entry point. To help manage Penn State’s image, Lanny J. Davis, the special counsel to President Bill Clinton from 1996 until 1998, has been retained as external counsel to Erickson.

(Still, he said, donations have largely remained consistent and applications to the main campus in State College were up 2 to 3 percent.) At Thursday’s event near Philadelphia, Anthony Lubrano, a 1982 graduate who has given millions to the university, held a competing session at the same hotel. His event was titled Real Talk and featured the former football star Franco Harris. About 300 alumni attended Erickson’s meeting. He fielded several questions from alumni, including a woman who was crying. Statements supportive of Paterno drew loud applause, though the most tense moment came when a 1991 alumnus, Matthew Kalafat, told the crowd that Paterno was not a victim and that not all alumni were upset by his firing. For his part, Erickson did not explain the trustees’ firing of Paterno, prompting questions about why trustees were not at the town hall events.

But he said at the end that he would consider what we said. I hope he does.” Erickson, an employee at Penn State since 1977, obtained his undergraduate and master’s degrees from the University of Minnesota and his doctorate in geography from the University of Washington. He served as the university’s executive vice president and provost since 1999, before he was appointed president, initially on an interim basis. Erickson, promoted by the board of trustees, entered his new position with a broad grasp of the university and had a good reputation among the deans and the professors. By choosing Erickson, who held a purely academic role as the provost, the trustees hoped to ensure there would not be a cloud over his administration created by concern about possible connections to the football program. “He should be reassuring to alumni that what really matters about Penn State is in good hands,” said William E. Kirwan, the chancellor of Maryland’s university system and a friend of Erickson’s. “The enduring value of the academic mission is solid and in place.” Erickson said that he intended to retire when his contract as president expired on June 30, 2014, time enough for Penn State to conduct a national search for his replacement. Until then, it will be up to Erickson to learn the nuances of the presidency on the fly while attempting to shepherd the university through its most fraught chapter.
