But the absence of big bucks and athletic scholarships is no guarantee that the Golden Rule will prevail. Take the case of Kenny Mennella.  An 18-year-old senior at Iona Preparatory School in New Rochelle, N.Y., Kenny proved himself to be an above-average student, though no whiz, and a talented half-miler, good enough to run anchor on Iona's all-county two-mile relay team. When he thought about college, Kenny set his sights on Cornell University. His parents warned him that it was a reach academically. Kenny understood and applied to a less competitive college as well. In an interview, Kenny recalled getting a call one day in late January from a track coach at Cornell. ''He thought I had a good chance to get in,'' Kenny said. Then came periodic reports in the mail on how the Big Red runners were faring and, finally, at the end of February, a call from yet another coach, who told him about the kind of workouts he could expect. ''By then Kenny was jumping around the house,'' said his mother, Nicki Morelli. ''It seemed inevitable that he would be accepted.''

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       ''It was a like a balloon popping,'' Kenny said. ''It was very upsetting.'' Even track seemed to lose its appeal. ''After he heard from Cornell, Kenny never ran another good race,'' said his coach, Jan Mitchell. Mrs. Morelli wrote a letter to the school, saying that ''the false expectation set by the track coach is absolutely unfair.'' She got one back apologizing for the possibility that ''Kenny felt overly encouraged by the two calls he received.'' Obviously, Kenny did not understand the rules of the game he was playing. At schools with big-time athletic programs things are fairly simple: coaches decide which high school athletes will be admitted. At Ivy League and other colleges that do not hand out athletic scholarships, though, the system is more Byzantine. Here's how it works: Coaches of each intercollegiate sport, men's and women's, seek out the best prospects they can find who have a shot at admission on academic grounds. They send the admissions director a rank-ordered wish list.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address.

Colgate does this for 23 sports, Yale for more than 30. Athletes, of course, are not the only students who get special attention. Children of alumni, potential big donors, artists, musicians - they all compete not so much against the general applicant pool as against each other. ''One year the music department told us that they needed a tuba player,'' said Willis D. Stetson of the University of Pennsylvania. ''We accepted seven of them. Unfortunately, they all came.'' Coaches, though, are the most aggressive recruiters. ''They have a formidable task,'' said Laing E. Kennedy, director of athletics at Cornell. ''The competition is fierce.'' When a coach telephones a potential recruit, the agenda is more complex than the recruit may realize. The coach wants to stir up interest, but also determine whether the student would come if admitted. You do not want to waste a slot on the wish list on a fish you cannot net. Coaches' enthusiasm can wax and wane between calls. A 4:30 miler who looks good in January may not be so attractive if a 4:25 one shows up in February. Last year, the Cornell men's lacrosse team lost most of its attack men. ''Replacing them became a priority,'' said Mr. Kennedy.

It's also easy to understand why students can let hopes triumph over objectivity. ''You're dealing with vulnerable teen-age kids,'' said one father, whose son was aggressively recruited and then rejected by a state university in New England. ''A coach is a supernatural figure.'' Kenny Mennella was approached by one other coach, from SUNY-Binghamton, who explained that his institution was a long shot for Kenny but that he would love to see Kenny come and run for the school. The youngster was accepted at Binghamton and plans to start there in the fall. As for Cornell, Frank Rhodes, its president, acknowledged that, even though Ivy League coaches try not to sound like Joe Isuzu, mistakes happen. ''In this case,'' he said, ''judging from the letters, we goofed.''    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
