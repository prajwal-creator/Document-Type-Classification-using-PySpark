Tommy John joined the brief gathering of veteran Yankees, all of them over 30, and asked about the B game on the adjacent field, which George Steinbrenner had watched from a shady seat in the stands. John was told that the Yankee prospects had beaten the Texas Rangers, 2-0. ''Thank God,'' he said. This morning, as a result of shabby play this exhibition season that culminated in Sunday's error-filled loss to the Orioles, the full Yankee team gathered here for two hours of extra work. Part of the squad played a B game in the morning; the rest spent two hours stretching, jogging and drilling on the practice fields where the players began this extended training period six weeks ago. Another extra workout will be held Tuesday afternoon but was scheduled before the Yankees' 6-1 loss tonight to the Montreal Expos, which dropped the spring record to 3-11. Dave Winfield, who had been sidelined with a hamstring pull, re-injured himself when he hit into a double play as a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning. Graig Nettles played despite a bruised right calf and committed an error. Sympathy for Collins   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   This morning, wearing pinstripes rather than the sweatsuits that Steinbrenner provided last month, the Yankees made jokes to ease the tension that has been building in recent weeks in a clubhouse of injured, ill and confused players. Dave Revering, one of the more over-worked Yankees, who is playing extra games as he learns to be a third baseman, presented Dave Collins with a lunch pail and a miners' helmet to commemorate Collins's hard work in playing 24 innings over the weekend.

''That was the manager's mistake. Dave's going to get some rest now.'' Collins, whose weight has dropped from 175 to 168 since he arrived here on Feb.8, has played seven of his 12 A games, including tonight's, in the outfield, despite the Yankees' contention when they signed him that he would spend spring training learning first base and would be an every day player once the season started. Today, a Yankee official who requested anonymity said that Collins was now scheduled to be an outfielder, which raises the possibility that someone - perhaps Jerry Mumphrey, the center fielder - is being considered as trade bait. Although Steinbrenner said he regretted Collins's overtime work, as well as Revering's, the owner said he had no sympathy for most of the Yankees, many of whom maintain they are mentally and physically exhausted. Steinbrenner pointed out that today's workout had not been physically demanding and had centered on mistakes that the Yankees had made in recent days such as pitchers failing to cover first base in bunting situations, baserunners getting caught off guard and outfielders not making routine catches.

You've got to push it. This was a constructive thing, and if they continue to make mistakes, we'll continue to do it. ''Don't tell me they're mentally fatigued. All of us get mentally fatigued but we push on. I work; I'm out there with them. These guys make more money than the President of the United States. Wouldn't it be some state of affairs if Ronald Reagan came downstairs one morning and said he was too tired to make a decision? What about the guy driving a cab in New York City? Let them try working and they'll see what mental fatigue is.'' Despite Steinbrenner's continued insistence that the Yankees have no cause for complaint, there was a sudden relaxing of rules after the workout, apparently as a result of decisions made at a staff meeting on Sunday night. While the players normally report for night games at 4 P.M., they did not have to come back this evening until 6:30, and the pitchers not scheduled to work tonight were excused until Tuesday despite a rule instituted last week that they remain at the ball park until the end of every game. There was also an attempt at fence-mending in the clubhouse when Steinbrenner's aides arrived after the workout with a catered lunch from a local restaurant. Instead of the usual hard-boiled eggs and carrot sticks, the players were treated to 70 barbecued beef or chicken sandwiches, cole slaw and baked beans. The surprise party had mixed results. Some players, like Ron Davis, were delighted. ''How can you get mad at a guy who does that?'' he asked. Others, primarly the old-timers, seemed unmoved by the gesture. ''I can't eat it anyway,'' Gamble said, ''because I've got the flu.''    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
