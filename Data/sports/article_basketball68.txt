Previews and Openings ‘The Christians’ (previews start on Friday; opens on Sept. 17) God may be in his heaven, but all is not right in the evangelical church presided over by Andrew Garman’s pastor. In this Playwrights Horizons drama, written by the smart and searching playwright Lucas Hnath and directed by Les Waters, the audience listens in on a contentious sermon that questions what we believe and why. 416 West 42nd Street, 212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org. (Alexis Soloski) ‘Empire Travel Agency’ (in previews; opens on Sept. 10) A theatrical staycation, the latest play from the Woodshed Collective takes four fortunate audience members on an immersive quest to discover “the key to the new golden age of the city,” somehow saving New York from gentrification. The play, written by Jason Gray Platt and directed by Teddy Bergman, begins at a Lower East Side pay phone and impels audiences into the night from there. Undisclosed location, empiretravelagency.com. (Soloski) ‘Hamlet in Bed’ (previews start on Friday; opens on Sept. 17) Michael Laurence’s new play takes on the mother of all Oedipal complexes (well, except for Oedipus’). Mr. Laurence plays a struggling, Hamlet-obsessed actor, determined to find his birth mother. Annette O’Toole stars as a potential Gertrude. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, 866-811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Soloski) ‘Judy’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Sept. 10) It’s 2040 in America. Cars drive themselves, the Internet is everywhere and Timothy’s wife has left him. In Max Posner’s melancholy comedy, directed by Ken Rus Schmoll and produced by Page 73, a family tries to knit together even as they remain apart, separated by grief and the various basements they inhabit. New Ohio Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, 866-811-4111, page73.org. (Soloski) ‘The Legend of Georgia McBride’ (in previews; opens on Sept. 9) The playwright Matthew Lopez has a way of making the marginalized major. His post-Civil War drama “The Whipping Man” centered on former slaves who converted to Judaism, and his new show is also about an indigent man in Florida who adopts a new religion — drag. Dave Thomas Brown stars as Casey, a former Elvis impersonator who mans up and drags out in order to support his pregnant bride. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, 866-811-4111, mcctheater.org. (Soloski) ‘The New Morality’ (in previews; opens on Sept. 21) Harold Chapin’s life was not especially funny. He died as a stretcher-bearer in France during World War I. But before that early death, he wrote several droll plays, including this marital comedy, revived by the Mint Theater. A houseboat on the Thames is not a home to domestic bliss when a wife accuses a neighbor of dallying with her husband. Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, 866-811-4111, minttheater.org. (Soloski) Origins First Irish Festival (performances start on Wednesday) The Emerald Isle meets the Big Apple in this festival devoted to work from Irish artists. The event features seven plays, a stand-up comedy act and a special edition of “Celebrity Autobiography.” Characters include a singing undertaker, a wet farmer, three residents of Windsor Terrace and an ex-con who teams up with a nun. At various locations, 1stirish.org. (Soloski) ‘Our Last Game’ (in previews; opens on Monday) It’s nice to see the playwright Ed Schmidt leave the house for a change. After “The Last Supper” and “My Last Play,” metatheatrical (and possibly autobiographical) works performed in his Brooklyn home, Mr. Schmidt relocates to the locker room of the Nord Anglia International School. In this gym-dandy solo, Mr. Schmidt plays a basketball coach. 44 East Second Street, East Village, ourlastgame.com. (Soloski) ‘Tyler Perry’s Madea on the Run’ (performances start on Thursday) How fast can Tyler Perry really run in a housedress and heels? Audiences will soon find out as the writer, director and actor brings the latest incarnation of his Madea persona to the stage. This time, Madea is on the lam, dodging the police while nursing a sick friend (Cassi Davis). Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, 866-858-0008, beacontheatre.com. (Soloski) Broadway ‘Amazing Grace’ The unusual life story of John Newton (a jaunty Josh Young), the Englishman who wrote the lyrics to the titular hymn — he matured from slave trader and scapegrace to fervently religious clergyman — is explored in this earnest but somewhat overstuffed musical with music and lyrics by Christopher Smith and book by Mr. Smith and Arthur Giron (2:30). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, 877-250-2929, amazinggracemusical.com. (Charles Isherwood) ★ ‘An American in Paris’ The ballet luminary Christopher Wheeldon makes a triumphant debut as a Broadway director with this rhapsodic stage adaptation of a classic musical with a heavenly Gershwin score. The ballet dancers Robert Fairchild and Leanne Cope, as the semi-star-crossed lovers, are radiant, and Max von Essen sings like a dream as an heir who aspires to a nightclub career. Pure joy (2:30). The Palace Theater. 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, 877-250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood) ★ ‘The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time’ Simon Stephens’s adaptation of Mark Haddon’s best-selling novel, about an autistic boy’s coming-of-age, is one of the most fully immersive works ever to wallop Broadway. Be prepared to have all your emotional and sensory buttons pushed. Marianne Elliott (“War Horse”) directs the excellent cast, led by Alex Sharp, and the dazzling technical team (2:25). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, curiousonbroadway.com, 212-239-6200. (Ben Brantley) ‘Finding Neverland’ This musical adaptation of the 2004 biopic about J. M. Barrie, the creator of “Peter Pan,” heightens the film’s tidy psychologizing and life-affirming messages by thickening their syrup and corn quotients. The show brings to mind those supersize sodas sold in movie theaters. It’s mostly empty calories. Diane Paulus directs a cast led by Matthew Morrison (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, 877-250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Fun Home’ This extraordinary musical memory play about a girl and her father, adapted by Jeanine Tesori (music) and Lisa Kron (book and lyrics) from Alison Bechdel’s graphic novel, occupies that mysterious place where we all grew up — the shifting landscape governed by those contradictory creatures, our parents. Sam Gold directs a nigh-flawless cast in a show that brings fresh oxygen to Broadway (1:40). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, funhomebroadway.com, 212-239-6200. (Brantley) ★ ‘Hamilton’ Yes, it really is that good. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s rap-driven portrait of the rise and fall of Alexander Hamilton, directed by Thomas Kail, makes us feel the unstoppable, urgent rhythm of a nation being born. A show that changes the language of the American musical, while offering resounding evidence that this beleaguered genre is not only surviving but thriving (2:45). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, 877-250-2929, hamiltonbroadway.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Hand to God’ Robert Askins’s black comedy, about a mild Christian boy whose hand puppet may (or may not) be possessed by the Devil, is as outlandishly funny as it is seriously spooky. Steven Boyer gives a bravura performance as the troubled teenager with the evil imp on his arm, and Geneva Carr is moving as his addled, newly widowed mother. The play, previously seen in two Off Broadway runs, has grown even sharper, and more disturbing, in its move uptown to Broadway (2:00). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, handtogodbroadway.com. (Isherwood) ★ ‘Hedwig and the Angry Inch’ Taye Diggs plays an “internationally ignored song stylist” of uncertain gender in John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask’s 1998 rock musical about love and loss. Michael Mayer directed this mightily entertaining exercise in crowd control. (1:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, 212-239-6200, hedwigbroadway.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘The King and I’ Bartlett Sher’s resplendent revival of this Rodgers and Hammerstein classic, set in the royal court of 19th-century Siam, is both panoramic and personal, balancing epic sweep with intimate sensibility, lavish set pieces with exquisitely sung soliloquies. Kelli O’Hara’s Anna Leonowens is something wonderful indeed (2:50). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, 212-239-6200, lct.org. (Brantley) ‘Mamma Mia!’ Before the 2008 Meryl Streep film, there was the stage version: This jukebox musical set to the music of Abba opened on Broadway in 2001 and recounts a young girl’s search for three possible fathers, all past paramours of her mother, Donna of the onetime Donna and the Dynamos (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, 212-639-6200, telecharge.com. ★ ‘On the Town’ John Rando’s take on this merry mating dance of a musical from 1944, about sailors on shore leave, feels as fresh as first sunlight. With airborne choreography by Joshua Bergasse, the production presents a parallel-universe New York where hectic urban life acquires the grace of a storybook ballet. It’s a bustling, jostling cartoon that floats like a swan (2:35). Lyric Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, 800-982-2787, onthetownbroadway.com. (Brantley) ‘Something Rotten!’ This rambunctious show, which weds the Elizabethan theater and the brassy Broadway musical, dances dangerously on the line between tireless and tedious. But the large cast, which includes Brian D’Arcy James and Christian Borle, remains as wired as Adderall-popping sophomores during exam week. Casey Nicholaw directed this exhausting frolic from Wayne and Karey Kirkpatrick, and John O’Farrell (2:20). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, 212-239-6200, rottenbroadway.com. (Brantley) Off Broadway ★ ‘The Absolute Brightness of Leonard Pelkey’ In James Lecesne’s enchanting solo show, the friends of a happily flamboyant 14-year-old New Jersey boy turn to the police after he disappears. With great heart and humor, Mr. Lecesne portrays more than a dozen characters in this sweet, sad, Dickensian show that returns to the stage after a run at Dixon Place earlier this year. Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, absolutebrightnessplay.com. (Isherwood) ‘Delirium’s Daughters’ Nicholas Korn’s one-act comedy about four Italian suitors asking for the hands-in-marriage of three young women is mostly just silliness, good-natured and competently executed. The ghost has the best scene (1:10). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, triumvirateartists.com. (Anita Gates) ★ ‘Drop Dead Perfect’ Returning in a production that played last year, Everett Quinton is in his old Ridiculous Theatrical Company glory days as a repressed Florida spinster in this farcical thriller, with tons of TV and old-movie melodrama, silly double entendres and a Cuban hunk named Ricardo (1:30). Theater at St. Clement’s, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, 845-786-2873, dropdeadperfect.com. (Gates) ★ ‘The Flick’ Annie Baker’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play about the beauty and sadness in the lives of three workers in a run-down movie theater has been remounted with the sublime original cast intact, under the deeply focused direction of Sam Gold. Moving, funny, unforgettable, but definitely a polarizing night at the theater, thanks to Ms. Baker’s quietly observational pacing (3:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, 212-868-4444, barrowstreettheatre.com. (Isherwood) ★ ‘Informed Consent’ Deborah Zoe Laufer’s engrossing drama follows the fate of a genetic anthropologist (a fiercely urgent Tina Benko) who becomes embroiled in controversy when her ethics are called into question during a study of a Native American tribe with high rates of diabetes. Directed at a brisk pace by Liesl Tommy, the play raises probing questions about the potential conflicts between the prerogatives of scientific inquiry and the sacredness of religious traditions (1:35). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 646-223-3010, primarystages.org. (Isherwood) ★ ‘John’ Annie Baker’s new play is a mysterious — and at times mystifying — but ultimately moving drama about a young couple (the wonderful Hong Chau and Christopher Abbott) trying to mend a rift in their relationship while visiting a bed-and-breakfast in Gettysburg, Pa. Georgia Engel plays the motherly proprietor, and Lois Smith her blind best friend. Weird, but kind of wonderful (3:15). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood) ★ ‘Mercury Fur’ Even those who binge on apocalyptic splatter movies are likely to be rattled by Philip Ridley’s portrait of savage revels in a war-ravaged New York City. But this New Group production, directed by Scott Elliott, is a penetrating analysis of how a culture shaped by violence transforms its inhabitants. It’s as intelligent as it is lurid (2:00). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-279-4200, thenewgroup.org. (Brantley) ‘My Son the Waiter: A Jewish Tragedy’ Brad Zimmerman’s solo show about almost three decades of working in restaurants while not becoming a famous actor, and his Jewish mother’s shame, is low-key, half-familiar, half-mordant and pretty delicious (1:30). Stage 72, 158 West 72nd Street, 212-868-4444, mysonthewaiter.com. (Gates) ‘Odd Birdz’ Oddball characters materialize fully formed in this sketch-comedy show by the clever young Israeli ensemble Tziporela, whose other great strength is physical humor. The show contains some hoary, squirm-inducing bits aimed at the lowest comedic denominator, but much of the rest is funny, and the exuberance of the company — making its American debut — is contagious (1:30). Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, 866-811-4111, tziporela.com. (Laura Collins-Hughes) ’Ruthless!’ This spiked Shirley Temple of a show, which first opened in 1992 and now returns with less fizz, follows the adventures of Tina Denmark (Tori Murray), a stage-struck prepubescent with occasional homicidal tendencies. But what must have once seemed wildly satirical could practically pass for documentary (1:35). St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, ruthlessthemusical.com. (Soloski) ★ ‘39 Steps’ This century’s most tireless and high-profile example of the little show that could, adapted from Alfred Hitchcock’s 1935 movie and seen on Broadway in 2008, returns for yet another antic struggle with bad guys with bad accents. Directed by Maria Aitken, with a cast of four playing too many roles to count, this paradigm of bare-bones theater remains indomitably funny (1:40). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, 877-250-2929, 39stepsny.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘The Weir’ Ciaran O’Reilly’s production of one of Conor McPherson’s finest plays, about a handful of lonely or troubled Irish men and women swapping tales of the supernatural, features a flawless cast that brings its gentle beauty alive with no fuss (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, 212-727-2737, irishrep.org. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway ‘Ziegfeld’s Midnight Frolic’ The death by poison of Olive Thomas, the “Ziegfeld Follies” beauty, is at the center of this diffuse, immersive show created by Cynthia von Buhler (“The Bloody Beginning”). The cast is talented, the costumes are glittery, and aerialists dangle from above, but the performance feels less like a theater piece than like an imitation 1920s cabaret show with a thematically related art installation taking place around it (2:45). (Saturdays only.) Liberty Theater, behind the Liberty Diner, 234 West 42nd Street, 866-811-4111, speakeasydollhouse.com. (Collins-Hughes) Long-Running Shows ‘Aladdin’ The Disney movie refashioned for the stage, with shtick, sparkles and silliness cutting the syrup (2:20).

Daryl Roth Theater, 20 Union Square East, at 15th Street, 212-239-6200, fuerzabrutanyc.com. ‘A Gentleman’s Guide to Love & Murder’ A feast of murder, music and merriment in Edwardian England (2:20).

Playroom Theater, 151 West 46th Street, 212-967-8278, stepinthebullpen.com. (Ken Jaworowski) ‘Summer Shorts Series A’ (closes on Saturday) Exercises in ethics, and some plain old exercise, mark the first half of this “Summer Shorts” festival from 59E59. Neil LaBute, Vickie Ramirez and Matthew Lopez offer one-act works — about suburban joggers, daytime drinkers and One World Trade widows — that are sometimes compelling, sometimes implausible and all admirably performed (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Soloski) ‘Summer Shorts Series B’ (closes on Saturday) In the second series of the 59E59’s Summer Shorts festival, an adrift Southerner writes letters to Kim Jong-il and a couch potato tries to peel himself away. The highlight is Robert O’Hara’s seamy, steamy “Built,” a treacherous thriller about a sexual encounter between a middle-aged professional woman (Merritt Janson) and a younger male hustler (Justin Bernegger) (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Soloski) Correction :  Because of an editing error, an entry in the theater listings on Friday about the play “Mercury Fur” misidentified the website for New Group, which is producing it. It is thenewgroup.org, not signaturetheatre.org. (The play is at Pershing Square Signature Center.)
