By MARK LANDLER SEPT. 2, 1998     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           At a time when investors seem ready to hang black crepe over the global economy, Indonesia's Finance Minister is guardedly optimistic about one of the world's bleakest economies. Ginandjar Kartasasmita, the coordinating minister for economy, finance, and industry, said today that Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, had strengthened more quickly than he expected. Barring any fresh calamities, he also said Indonesia's economy could show a positive growth rate in two years. Mr. Ginandjar, 57, who served under President Suharto and was kept on by Mr. Suharto's successor, B. J. Habibie, said the Government had moved swiftly to rebuild the shattered economy by taking over insolvent banks and negotiating a deal to revamp crushing corporate debt. ''If you compare us to other governments -- Yeltsin, China, whomever -- we are moving more rapidly than many others,'' said Mr. Ginandjar, a suave bureaucrat who has parlayed his ties to the global financial community into a powerful position in the Government.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       If the rupiah continues to rise at this rate, Mr. Ginandjar said the Government would surpass its goal of getting the exchange rate to 10,000 rupiah to the dollar by the end of the year. After falling as low as 17,000 to the dollar last winter, the rupiah was trading at 10,700 late today. A stronger rupiah would be a tonic for the economy, Mr. Ginandjar said. It would ease the burden of $140 billion in public and private debt and allow the Government to cut subsidies on food, fuel and electricity. Mr. Ginandjar acknowledged that Indonesia still faced profound economic problems. Inflation is running at an annual rate of 80 percent; one-fifth of Indonesia's 92 million workers are unemployed, and economists project that the country's output will contract by 15 percent this year. Even worse, a new report by the International Labor Organization projects that 75 million people, or 37 percent of Indonesia's population, will fall below the poverty line by the end of this year. That could rise to 100 million by 1999 -- the highest poverty levels since the mid-1960's. ''These are not normal times,'' Mr. Ginandjar said. Referring to the riots that left 1,200 people dead, Jakarta in flames and the economy in ruins, he said, ''What happened in May will have a long-lasting effect on Indonesia.'' Social unrest continues. Today, mobs rampaged for a second day in the northern province of Aceh. The army is in the process of withdrawing from Aceh, which has a strong separatist movement. But the people have been looting shops, banks and hotels to protest nearly a decade of military presence in the region.

The Government recently took over the nation's largest private bank, Bank Central Asia, and announced plans to shut down three other banks and merge four state-owned ones. Indonesia has also restructured its $80 billion in private debt with foreign lenders, rather than threatening to impose a debt moratorium or telling creditors that they would have to suffer a loss, as Russia recently did.

In addition to Russia's rebuff of foreign lenders, Malaysia announced yesterday that it would impose sweeping capital and exchange controls to stem the decline of its currency, the ringgit. In Hong Kong, a bastion of free-market economics in Asia, the government has intervened aggressively to prop up its flagging stock market. Even the United States, which escaped the effects of the Asian flu for more than a year, has come down with a worrying case of the sniffles. In the short run, Mr. Ginandjar said, a slowdown in the United States would actually benefit Indonesia, since it would stem the flow of capital from Asia across the Pacific. If that capital outflow were slowed or even reversed, the rupiah could be further buoyed. Although a slowdown in the United States would hobble Indonesia's exports, Mr. Ginandjar said those exports were already so depressed that a further decline would barely affect the country's growth rate. ''I'm not saying that a U.S. recession would benefit Indonesia,'' he added. ''But I'm saying that there would be some short-term benefits out of it.'' Some analysts suggest that Russia should take a page out of Indonesia's playbook. The two countries are similar in that both have suffered a triple hit from collapsing currencies, suffocating debt and political crisis. Christopher Wood, a regional strategist at Santander Investment Securities in Hong Kong, observed that Indonesia's recovery began only after President Suharto resigned. For Russia to climb out of its current predicament, Mr. Wood said, President Boris N. Yeltsin would have to step aside, too. Mr. Ginandjar, who has been said by people here to harbor presidential ambitions of his own, was reluctant to comment on Russia's woes. ''I'm not a good teacher,'' he said with a wry smile. ''We have made so many mistakes that I would not want to put us in the position of telling other countries what to do.''
