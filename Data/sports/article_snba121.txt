As he reaches midcourt, his left foot crosses the line but the ball is still in the backcourt. Can he bring his left foot back over the center line? Also, when a player inbounds the ball, can one of his feet be over the end line if it is up in the air? In the first example, as long as the ball is still being dribbled in the back court, the player can bring his left foot back over the center line. In the second instance, as long as one foot is outside the court, he is not considered to be breaking the plane of the boundary line and the play is legal. QUESTION: When the New York Yankees began their season on April 9, the attendance of 55,123 was said to be an opening-day record. Yet, I remember being at the first game ever at the Stadium in 1923, and I seem to recall there were reports that 70,000 or more attended. What was the actual attendance then, as my memory of a game 58 years ago may not be so reliable? There were 74,200 fans on hand on April 18, 1923, for the dedication of the Stadium. However, according to the Yankees, only 53,523 paid. Incidentally, 25,000 more fans were turned away as the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox, 4-1, with Babe Ruth hitting a home run. QUESTION: Which player, Stan Musial or Ted Williams, had the better career ratio of strikeouts to times at bat?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Musial batted 10,972 times and struck out 696 times for a .063 ratio. Williams batted 7,706 times and struck out 709 times for .092.  QUESTION: Wasn't there a time when, before two were out, any fly ball that was caught but advanced a runner was considered a sacrifice fly and therefore not a time at bat?  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Yes, but the rule has been changed a number of times over the years. In 1908, the rule stated that the runner had to score on the catch for it to be a sacrifice fly. In 1926, it was changed so that if a runner advanced on any base it was a sacrifice fly. In 1931, the batter was no longer credited with a sacrifice fly, but in 1936 the original rule was restored - it was a sacrifice fly if a runner scored. In 1940, the batter again was no longer credited with a sacrifice fly. In 1954, the original rule was again restored - the runner had to score for the batter to be credited with a sacrifice fly. That rule is still in effect. QUESTION: In a National Hockey League game, Team A has a man advantage and is on a power play. A Team B player is called for a penalty, but it is delayed because Team A retains possession of the puck. Team A then scores. What happens to the man in the penalty box and to the delayed penalty? The score wipes out the delayed penalty and the man in the box must remain there until his penalty has expired. The delayed penalty would be wiped out by a score even if there was no Team B player in the penalty box. QUESTION: Which player in each league won the batting championship with the fewest number of times at bat? The most times at bat? American League: Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers, 345 times at bat for .368, in 1914; Tony Oliva, Minnesota Twins, 672 for .323, in 1964. National League: Eugene (Bubbles) Hargrave, Cincinnati Reds, 326 for .353, in 1926; Pete Rose, Cincinnati, 680 for .338, in 1973. QUESTION: When Lefty Grove won 31 games and lost 4 for the old Philadelphia Athletics in 1931, how many of those victories were in relief?

QUESTION: Who are the top five career scorers in the North American Soccer League? Not including the 1981 season: Giorgio Chinaglia, Cosmos, 132 games, 126 goals, 48 assists, 300 points; Ilija Mitic, San Jose, 166-101-37-239; Steve David, San Jose, 161-97-28-222; Paul Child, Atlanta, 210-89-39-217; Alan Willey, Minnesota, 128-79-23-181. QUESTION: I have heard the term ''academic all-American'' used in reference to college basketball players. Please define the term. The players, who are nominated by their colleges, must have at least a 3.0 scholastic average and be outstanding in the sport. The final selection is then made by the College Sports Information Directors of America. Academic all-Americans were first chosen in football in 1951. In recent years, similar teams have also been selected in baseball and men's and women's basketball. QUESTION: How many career grand slam homers did George Kelly, John Mize and Ernie Lombardi each have?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Kelly had 8, Mize and Lombardi 6 each. QUESTION: Sometimes a thoroughbred has two stallions listed as his sires because there is some doubt at to which is the true parent. In such a case, which owner in stakes race would share in the stallion award that is given in addition to the purse money and the breeders' award (given to the owner of the mare that foaled the throughbred)? The owner of the second sire listed is the entitled to the stallion award. Listing of two sires will be eliminated in the future, however, because the Jockey Club now requires blood tests when the parentage of the horse is in doubt. Those tests determine which stallion is the father. QUESTION: I recall an 18-inning game in which Johnny Burnett of the Cleveland Indians made nine hits. When was the game played, who won it and who were the pitchers for both teams? The game, between the Indians and the Philadelphia Athletics, was played in Cleveland on July 10, 1932. The A's won, 18-17, getting 25 hits to 33 for the Indians. Louis (Lew) Krausse Sr. pitched the first inning for the A's and was replaced by Eddie Rommel, who went the remaining 17 innings and was the winning pitcher. Willis Hudlin started for the Indians and went seven innings. Wes Ferrell relieved him in the eighth, finished the game and was the losing pitcher.  Burnett still holds the record for the most hits in an extra-inning game. Question Box is a regular feature of SportsMonday.
