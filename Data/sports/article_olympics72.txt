An arbitration panel, in a 53-page ruling released Tuesday, reduced Gatlin’s potential eight-year ban to four. It will expire on May 24, 2010. Gatlin needed the ban reduced to two years to be eligible to compete in the Olympic trials in June, and to run in the Beijing Olympics in August. Still, the panel left open the possibility of a further reduction. The three-member panel unanimously ruled that Gatlin, 25, committed a doping offense when he tested positive for excessive testosterone in April 2006, but his first doping offense in 2001 troubled the group. If that doping violation were erased, that would make Gatlin’s 2006 case his first offense, clearing the way for a further reduced ban. First doping offenses often result in a two-year ban, which would make Gatlin eligible to run in May, a month before the Olympic trials.

The panel called the circumstances surrounding Gatlin’s first offense “the real dilemma.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As a 19-year-old competitor at the world junior championships, Gatlin tested positive for amphetamines, part of a prescribed medication he was taking for attention deficit disorder. Gatlin had stopped taking the medicine a few days before the competition, but it did not clear his system, according to the case records. He received a two-year ban. The International Association of Athletics Federations, the sport’s world governing body, later reinstated Gatlin after he had served only one year of the ban but never specifically said Gatlin had “no fault” in the case. The United States Anti-Doping Agency characterized Gatlin’s reinstatement as a reduction in the ban whereas Gatlin contended it vacated the finding of a doping offense.

A “no fault” finding would erase the offense. The 2001 findings came under different standards than those in effect now because the World Anti-Doping Code had yet to be established. The ruling means Gatlin will have no immediate chance to regain his world record in the 100 meters. He shared the record of 9.77 seconds with Asafa Powell of Jamaica. Powell has improved the record, finishing in 9.74 seconds last September. Gatlin has said he does not know how steroids got into his system before the April 2006 test. Gatlin accused a massage therapist of rubbing a steroid cream on him to trigger the positive test, but the massage therapist has denied the allegations.
