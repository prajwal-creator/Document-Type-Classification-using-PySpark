Credit Eduardo Munoz/Reuters     Fearing the spread of a meningitis outbreak that has caused seven people at Princeton University to be hospitalized this year, university officials have warned students to stop sharing drinks and to avoid kissing. Bright orange posters urge students to “keep healthy and carry on,” and red cups labeled “Mine. Not Yours” serve as reminders not to share drinks at parties. Despite the campaign, a male student last week was found to have bacterial meningitis, nearly eight months after the outbreak’s first case, in which a female student returned from spring break showing symptoms. Although the previous six patients have recovered from the disease, in which bacteria cause infections that can maim or kill people within hours, the university’s leaders are considering a stronger step to halt the outbreak: distributing a vaccine not approved for use in the United States. Under New Jersey law, meningitis vaccinations are already required for almost all undergraduates at Princeton and other four-year colleges in the state. But the strain of the illness at Princeton — serogroup B — is not covered by the vaccine that is widely available in the United States and that protects against most strains of the disease. Another vaccine, Bexsero, does, but has been approved only by authorities in Europe and Australia. In response to the Princeton outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have received special permission from the Food and Drug Administration to import Bexsero. The university’s trustees could decide as early as Monday whether to distribute it, Martin Mbugua, a university spokesman, said. Barbara Reynolds, a C.D.C. spokeswoman, said the vaccination would be voluntary.

Kissing or coughing can spread the disease; entering a room where there is a sick person does not.

Symptoms include a headache, high fever and a stiff neck. Some students are half-jokingly passing around a common test for the illness, students said: whether your neck is too stiff for you to touch your chin to your chest. But even as parents worry and university officials urge students to avoid unnecessary contact, because of the small number of people who have come down with the illness at Princeton, most students have felt little urgency to change their habits even though the outbreak is a common conversation topic, some students said. “It’s so at an arm’s length that it’s not something that’s real for most people,” said Emilie Burke, 20, a sophomore. But, she said, her teammates on the women’s rugby team had stopped sharing water bottles, and people at her office job had begun wiping down phones between uses. As for whether students had cut back on casual sexual encounters, Ms. Burke said, “Maybe it’s something people think about during the day, but it’s not something they’re thinking about on a Saturday night.”   A version of this article appears in print on November 18, 2013, on Page A23 of the New York edition with the headline: Princeton Considers Use of Foreign Meningitis Vaccine.
