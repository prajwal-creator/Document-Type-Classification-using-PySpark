On Facebook, people who have hundreds of “friends” still collect them avidly:  “Will you be my friend, we already have 15 in common?” Twitter , the social-networking site of the moment, traffics in a different currency — “followers,” who presumably are loyal to you, fascinated by you, enthralled by you. Imagine what you could accomplish with an army of followers, the lands you could conquer! Twitter could help you. In the last few months it has plucked  a few hundred users from a sea of more than 30 million and put them on its A-list, deeming them particularly worthy of being followed. In separating the wheat from the chaff, Twitter has become a kingmaker of sorts, conferring online stardom to a mix of writers, gadget geeks, political commentators and entrepreneurs.

A writer with an interest in comic books can become the expert on comic books; a political pundit with a radio show ends up having a greater audience online than on the air; and an actor like LaVar Burton, decades away from his glory days as a star of the TV drama “Roots,” has a personal audience of 635,000.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       And just as publicity agents used to inveigle syndicated columnists like Walter Winchell into giving  their clients a mention, modern-day publicity hounds are already trying to game the list. The Web entrepreneur Jason Calacanis declared that he would pay $250,000 to be on Twitter’s suggestion list for two years. He says the offer was only “half-real.” But in an e-mail interview he explained that had Twitter accepted his offer he would have used his enhanced status to promote his search engine, Mahalo, not himself. “If they had taken the money I would have two or three million followers on that account,” and at 10 cents a follower, he would consider it to be a bargain. Twitter is not believed to be profitable, and some wonder if it won’t end as a flash in the pan like other online ventures that could never turn public fervor into a going business. Could selling placement on the suggested users list be used to generate revenue? “Not as far as I know,” said Jenna Sampson, a spokeswoman for Twitter. Later in the conversation, though, she hedged a bit. “Everything is an option at this point,” she said, reflecting the company’s relatively recent arrival. Complicating Twitter’s decision is the recognition that its users themselves presumably could sell mentions on their feeds to businesses and personalities. The power of getting placed in the column of J. J. Hunsecker (a thinly disguised version of Winchell), for example, is what drives the plot of the iconic film “Sweet Smell of Success.” It was Hunsecker’s wheels that were greased, not the newspaper’s. Kathleen Hessert, whose company, Sports Media Challenge, advises athletes on how to extend their popularity online, says that cracking the suggested user list could become an important goal for some of her clients. Not for clients like Shaquille O’Neal or Peyton Manning, but for the B-list celebrities, like, say, the solid basketball player Troy Murphy of the Indiana Pacers, who uses Twitter to share his concern for the environment. (She said that she would like  Twitter to  put placement up to a vote that  would genuinely represent potential public interest.)

Suggested users become a welcome wagon. “People were signing up and then they weren’t following anyone,” said Biz Stone, one of Twitter’s co-founders. Did he realize he was helping to create an arbiter of popularity? “We didn’t think that far ahead,” he said. The list is cobbled together by a team of employees whose identities were withheld, lest they be bombarded with Twitterers trying to manipulate the process. The company says it compiles the list by tracking fast-growing accounts and then deciding whom to anoint. Ms. Sampson said “there’s sort of a criteria” for the list “but not really.” Twitter says it wants to highlight personally revealing accounts, not promotional ones, although businesses like The New York Times,  JetBlue and the N.F.L. are represented. In essence, the list indicates “this is how we think Twitter should be used,” she said. Web users are already well aware of the role that powerful sites like Apple’s iTunes, Netflix, and Amazon.com play in the promotion of music, films and books. Twitter is taking this influence in a new direction, however, by applying its recommendation power to people instead of products. Twitter’s list includes many celebrities as well, like Lance Armstrong, Mr. O’Neal and Britney Spears. But, naturally, it is the once-obscure users, like the science technology writer Steven Johnson, who are most changed by the experience. Twitter doesn’t notify the people on its list; Mr. Johnson says he only learned about it in January when he was on a book tour in the Northwest and suddenly received 200 e-mail messages in a matter of hours, each informing him that he had a new follower. “I sent out a tweet saying ‘where did you all come from?’ ” he recalled.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In short order, Mr. Johnson’s following rose from 5,000 to more than 630,000. (And the number keeps growing every hour.) “That is a big force,” he said. “I’m not Oprah, but I can get some chatter about something going pretty effectively — I put a link to something and I can see it repeated.” In the process, Mr. Johnson said, he has been able to witness the rising importance of new-media outlets and the lessening influence of traditional media outlets like Time magazine, which recently printed his essay on (surprise!) the transformative power of Twitter . That essay was featured on the cover with a sample tweet of Mr. Johnson’s. “It’s funny, everybody has been asking me, you got your Twitter ID on the cover of Time magazine, you must be getting an insane amount of followers,” he said. “And I say it’s nothing compared to the steady influx you get from being on the suggested user list.”   A version of this article appears in print on , on Page WK3 of the New York edition with the headline: The Tweet Smell of Success.
