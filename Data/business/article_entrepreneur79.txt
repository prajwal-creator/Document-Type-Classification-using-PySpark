Mike Homer, a hard-charging executive at Netscape Communications in the 1990s, and his friends certainly subscribed to that belief. It is what led them two years ago to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars, along with powerful new computers, to the University of California, San Francisco, where some of the nation’s top researchers are trying to solve intractable medical mysteries. In a cruel twist of fate, however, the group is getting a sober lesson in the limits of technology and money. Last May, Mr. Homer, 50, learned he had  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain-wasting disorder sometimes likened to mad cow disease . A cure has not been found. Similar lessons, under different circumstances, were learned last year when technological search-and-rescue operations, using the power of distributed computing, came up empty in the hunt for a computer scientist lost at sea and for an adventurer whose plane had disappeared in the desert.

Silicon Valley has a long history of optimism — a belief that its technology can defy the laws of nature. The inventor Ray Kurzweil has said that people will be able to reverse the effects of disease and aging, leading to a promise of immortality.

Legions of Web surfers have written articles for Wikipedia, and bloggers and people posting videos to YouTube maintain that they help democratize the media. “You cannot be an innovator or an entrepreneur unless you’re an optimist,” said Paul Saffo, a Silicon Valley technology forecaster. “You have to be an optimist in the face of logic and experience. Most ideas fail, most companies fail and most entrepreneurs fail.” But Andrew Keen, an author, entrepreneur and social critic, derides what he calls the valley’s “digital Utopians.” “This shows the strengths and weaknesses of Silicon Valley,” Mr. Keen said. “The optimism, the can-do, the vitality are the classic American qualities that have helped Silicon Valley achieve so much. But there’s also an absurd side. People there are indulgent, they lack perspective, and they have a belief that they can do anything. There are some things you can’t do." Mr. Homer’s wife, Kristina, who met her husband when both worked at Netscape, said that when she heard the bleak diagnosis  —  and that no one with  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease survives  —  she got straight to work on attacking the problem.

Campbell, the chairman of Intuit and another close friend of Mr. Homer, has led the effort. “The campaign now has turned to how can we save others.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The Fight for Mike campaign has raised more than $7 million, which doctors at the San Francisco campus say could help cure other neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease.  Mr. Homer’s friends have faith in the medical school, where a Nobel laureate,  Stanley B. Prusiner, leads  research into prion diseases, and where Mr. Homer’s doctor, Michael Geschwind, is leading the first- treatment study for  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the United States. Keeping an eye on a brighter future, even as the bubbles burst or hope fades, was certainly true in two other instances when Silicon Valley rallied to use technology to search for the missing. James Gray, a researcher with Microsoft and renowned computer scientist, disappeared in January 2007 when he sailed from San Francisco to scatter his mother’s ashes at sea. In September, the adventurer Steve Fossett was piloting a small plane over a Nevada desert when he vanished. While both events led to  full-scale search-and-rescue operations, they also provided showcases for Microsoft and Google, as well as for Amazon’s “Mechanical Turk” technology. The idea behind  the Mechanical Turk program is that human beings perform some tasks better than computers, like identifying objects in photographs. Using the Amazon service, groups of people could take satellite photos, made available by Microsoft and Google, and divide them into manageable tasks. Hundreds of volunteers worldwide logged on to their computers and painstakingly searched these photos of ocean or desert. The men, or even the boat and the plane, have not been found. People involved in those searches did not necessarily see a failure of technology. "It’s not that futile,” said Joseph M. Hellerstein, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped lead the search for Mr. Gray. “In science and medicine, you try a second, third and fourth time, and progress is made. You need doggedness and insight.” “It’s not a bad thing to try this stuff,” Professor Hellerstein added. “This is how discovery is done. Hubris is part of the intellectual exercise.”   A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C6 of the New York edition with the headline: Despite Silicon Valley Optimism, a Disease Resists Cure.
