Credit Timothy Ivy for The New York Times     HARRISON FOR the last few years, every time that Mayor Raymond J. McDonough met with Thomas A. DeGise, the Hudson County executive, formally or informally, he made a point of steering the conversation to a proposed major-league soccer stadium. Mr. DeGise, whose county includes Harrison, was among those pushing for a new stadium, too, but it was as if Mayor McDonough never wanted the topic to drift too far from anyone’s consciousness. He believed Harrison badly needed that stadium. “Ray McDonough was a pit bull,” Mr. DeGise said, smiling. The mayor  is finally getting his dream of bringing a major-league soccer stadium to Harrison, a working-class town of 14,000.  After eight years and many delays, the first pieces of steel for the new stadium, renamed the Red Bull Arena, went into the ground last month. The stadium, scheduled to open in 2009,  is expected to cost about $200 million and will seat more than 25,000 fans.

Mr. McDonough said that it  could include retail stores,  800 units of housing, two hotels and a parking garage. “This has been dragging on,” Mr. McDonough said of the plans,  “but it’s finally to the point where it’s going to happen.” Mr. McDonough was convinced long ago that the stadium project would be a catalyst for Harrison, a town across the Passaic River from Newark. Every day, he said, at least one resident stops by his office seeking help finding  a job, a sign to him that residents are looking for  something to boost employment. Symbolically, Harrison is an ideal site for a soccer stadium. Many of its residents are immigrants from South America, where soccer is king. Many  sharpened their own soccer skills at the Courts, a former tennis complex in town that was turned into a soccer field 30 years ago.

It is also a few blocks from Harrison’s PATH station. Mayor McDonough said he had been told that PATH plans to invest $173 million over the next five years to upgrade the station. That station is “our home run,”  Mr. McDonough said, borrowing a metaphor from another sport, to explain that the PATH train would encourage more commuters to New York to live in Harrison. “We’re still a very small community, and for a town the size of Harrison to attract a major-league facility like this is just tremendous — beyond the dreams of a lot of us,” said Peter B. Higgins III, the chairman of the Harrison Redevelopment Authority.

The original plan to build a stadium for the team,  then known as the MetroStars, was announced in July 2004, but groundbreaking was delayed for two years.  The project was pushed back last year because of a problem with environmental cleanup. The stadium was then redesigned after the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which had owned the MetroStars, sold its 50 percent interest in the project last November. John Amorosa, the construction project director, said that 4,000 piles had been driven and 5,000 cubic yards of concrete poured since January, but there was nothing rising out of the ground to take note of until the first steel beam was set   last month. “The people on the trains haven’t seen anything, so they might have been thinking there was nothing going on,” Mr. Amorosa said. “It was like, ‘Where is everything?’ Now they’ll start to see that it’s a reality.”   A version of this article appears in print on , on Page NJ7 of the New York edition with the headline: New Soccer Stadium Under Way in Harrison.
