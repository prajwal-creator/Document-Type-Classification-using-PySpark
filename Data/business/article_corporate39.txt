It was the first time the S.&.P. 500 crossed into a correction nine days after hitting an all-time high , Mr. Detrick wrote. • The S.&P. 500 has moved at least 1 percent in eight sessions, matching last year’s number of 1 percent moves. • One trader made nearly $200 million on a bet that volatility would surge, according to Pravit Chintawongvanich, the head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, via Bloomberg . • Bloomberg also reports that E*Trade added 64,581 gross new brokerage accounts in January, the most in a month since September 2016. Has the 30-year bond bull market reached a top? Ray Dalio thinks so. In a LinkedIn post , the billionaire hedge fund manager said: “We don’t know exactly how far we are from the top in the stock market and then the economy, though it is clear that we are past the top in the bond market.” Yet Jeff Rosenberg, the chief fixed-income strategist at BlackRock, said that it is a “fool’s errand” to call the end of the bond bull market. Mr. Rosenberg told CNBC that while he expects higher bond yields to persist for a period, he is not ready to call the end of the bond bull market.

Federal ownership of these assets can result in sub-optimal investment decisions and create risk for taxpayers. Some context: Only one U.S. airport — Puerto Rico’s — has successfully been privatized. (Chicago’s bid to privatize Midway failed four years ago .) Thus far, St. Louis is the only mainland U.S. city that is exploring privatizing its airport , but the effort has drawn criticism . A n interesting point about infrastructure investing raised by Dan Primack of Axios:   Long-term issue: Private equity is flush w/ cash as investors search for yield. As rates rise, however, harder for funds w/ lower return prospects -- such as infrastructure -- to raise. But WH infra plan relies on lots more of these funds being raised. —
        Dan Primack (@danprimack) Feb. 12, 2018     The average level of return that infrastructure investment funds have sought was about 10.6 percent in 2016 , down from 14 percent in 2004, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Global Infrastructure Investor Association. Infrastructure in general is regarded as a lower-return asset class with fairly consistent cash flows. While the Blackstone Group is raising $40 billion for its own infrastructure fund (half of which is coming from Saudi Arabia), it’s hard to see private investors filling in the $1.3 trillion required to fulfill the Trump administration’s vision. To break it down numerically: • PwC and the G.I.A.A. note that roughly $200 billion had been raised by infrastructure investors since 2006. • Roughly $1.7 trillion was invested worldwide between January 2010 and September 2016. — Michael de la Merced What investors are watching to guess the markets’ direction The recent, complacency-shaking declines in stock prices will have forced investors to take more seriously the yardsticks used to assess whether stocks are worth buying. None of the metrics on their own reliably can predict the direction of stocks, but when markets are freaking out and much is a blur, well-chosen indicators can steady the nerves and clarify the mind. The most important indicator right now It’s the 10-year Treasury note’s yield, which moves in the opposite direction to its price. A higher yield reflects greater inflation fears among investors — and a higher likelihood of that interest rates are going up.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Stock investors fear higher interest rates for two main reasons: • Most immediately, they make stock valuations look less attractive • In the longer term, they can eventually slow economic growth. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has retreated to 2.83 percent Monday, while United States stocks are trading higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all up more than 0.5 percent. Adding to the fun The government inflation figures come out on Wednesday. The valuation question The recent volatility in the stock market has stirred up the valuation debate. Put more directly, did the declines take stock prices down to level where they no longer look expensive? There are many ways to tackle that question. But for no particular reason, let’s look at the Rule of 20 today. This yardstick subtracts the inflation rate from the number 20 and compares that answer with the price-to-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500. Stocks are theoretically overvalued if the price-to-earnings ratio is higher. Right now, the S.&P. 500 price-to-earnings ratio is 21.1 times , 3.2 above the 17.9 that you get from subtracting the inflation rate from 20. That suggests stocks could have further to fall. Still, history shows why that might not be the case. In 1997, the rule of 20 gave roughly the same answer as we have now, but stocks kept zooming higher. (Of course, that bull run did not end well. By 2001, the stock market was down below 1997 levels.) If you find the debate over valuation unsatisfactory ... There are also technical indicators, which look at how traders react to a wide selection of market measurements. One of the most interesting right now is the 200-day moving average on the S.&P. 500. John Kimelman at Barron’s gave a good run down on why it matters: But at one point Friday, it looked like that was where things were heading. Shortly before 1 p.m., the Standard & Poor’s 500 briefly broke below its 200-day moving average, or 2539, before recovering and closing the week above 2619, up 1.5% on the day.  The 200-day moving average—the continually updated average price of the past 200 days—is considered a strong measure of investor sentiment. If the S&P 500 had continued to fall below the average, it would have conveyed real bearishness. The S&P 500 hasn’t closed below that moving average in 408 trading sessions, going back to around the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, according to LPL Financial. — Peter Eavis  Photo        Under the deal announced on Wednesday, Xerox, of Norwalk, Conn., will become part of the Fuji Xerox joint venture, which sells office products and services in the Asia-Pacific region.   Credit Douglas Healey/Associated Press    Icahn and Deason urge shareholders not to “let Fuji steal” Xerox. Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, two of Xerox’s biggest investors, sent a letter to shareholders criticizing the printer and copier maker’s deal with Fujifilm Holdings of Japan.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   From the letter : It really is a remarkable achievement by Fuji. Without putting up any cash, they will acquire majority control and ownership of a venerable American icon. In exchange, we – the existing Xerox shareholders – will receive (1) an additional, indirect 25% interest in a Fuji subsidiary that just last year disclosed a $360 million accounting scandal caused by a “culture of concealment” and Fuji’s failure to have adequate management systems and (2) a one-time special dividend financed with our own assets. The backstory Xerox said on Jan. 31 that it would combine operations with Fujifilm Holdings in a $6.1 billion deal. The complicated transaction will fold Xerox into an existing 55-year-old joint venture. Xerox shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $9.80 a share and will own 49.9 percent of the combined business, which will be publicly traded. The move is expected to save at least $1.7 billion in costs , though Fujifilm will cut 10,000 jobs . At the end of last year, Mr. Icahn launched a campaign to unseat the Xerox’s board, and late last month, he and Mr. Deason pressured the company to explore a deal — including revising or ending the Fujifilm joint venture. Xerox’s statement , via Reuters: Xerox said it “considered several other options in detail and concluded that the combination with Fuji Xerox is the ‘best path to create value’ for the company.” — Stephen Grocer   Broadcom CEO Hock Tan: We'd Walk If We Don't Control Qualcomm Board | CNBC  Video by CNBC   Broadcom will walk if it doesn’t get control of Qualcomm’s board. Broadcom’s chief executive, Hock Tan, appeared on CNBC to discuss his company’s $121 billion bid for Qualcomm. The appearance comes just days before the two companies are scheduled to meet to discuss the deal and less than a month before Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting on March 6. Broadcom proposed a slate of 11 directors to replace the entire board of Qualcomm in December. Here are some of Mr. Tan’s comments: On concerns the deal won’t win regulatory approval and Broadcom’s offer of an $8 billion breakup fee if it doesn’t: “You know, I’m kind of a frugal guy. You think I would sign up to pay $8 billion if there’s even a second thought?” On if Qualcomm’s shareholders don’t vote for a majority of Broadcom’s slate on March 6: “This is a binary proposal. If at least a majority of our slate does not get in on March 6, then I guess we will get the message that this deal is not going to happen. We will walk.” On Qualcomm’s $110 a share offer for NXP Semiconductors, which has gotten pushback from NXP investors : “NXPI will not solve Qualcomm’s problems.” On the possibility that Qualcomm increases its bid for NXP Semiconductors: “If Qualcomm raises the price on NXPI, we have made it very clear, it’s a clear transfer of value from Qualcomm shareholders to NXPI shareholders.”  “$110 is a full and fair price for NXPI.”  Photo         Credit Mark Lennihan/Associated Press    Who wants to buy which Time Inc. titles from Meredith?

General Dynamics will pay $40.75 a share in cash, up 32 percent from CSRA’s Friday closing price. Phebe Novakovic, General Dynamics’ chairman and C.E.O., said of the deal: CSRA’s management team has created an outstanding provider of innovative, next-generation IT solutions with industry-leading margins. We see substantial opportunities to provide cost-effective IT solutions and services to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies.

For context: Unilever spent more than $9 billion on marketing last year, for products from Dove soap to Lipton iced tea. What Keith Weed, its chief marketing officer, plans to say at the Interactive Advertising Bureau conference today: “We cannot continue to prop up a digital supply chain — one that delivers over a quarter of our advertising to our consumers — which at times is little better than a swamp in terms of its transparency.” Remember: Unilever was already outspoken about the need to clean up the digital ad industry. And shareholders like BlackRock have called upon public companies to do more social good, or risk a backlash.  Photo         Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times    Are the infrastructure and budget plans ‘science fiction’? That’s what Axios reckons , since neither White House proposal is likely to go anywhere. On infrastructure Don’t look for more specifics from the Trump administration, including on how its initiative will be funded. Republican lawmakers are wary of more spending: The government funding bill that Mr. Trump signed last week will push the budget deficit toward $1 trillion. Representative Daniel Lipinski, Democrat of Illinois, told the WaPo of the plan, “I think it’s just dead on arrival .” And the National Resource Defense Council attacked it as an “unacceptable corporate giveaway.” Politico points out that the proposal would shift many project decisions to state governments . On the budget proposal Last week’s bill made it irrelevant. Still, Mick Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget warned yesterday that the growing budget deficit could lead to a “spike” in interest rates .
