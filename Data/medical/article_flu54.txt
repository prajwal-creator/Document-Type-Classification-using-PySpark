He could do nothing about first baseman John Valentin's eighth-inning error, which allowed the Braves to tie the score. Not wanting to risk further injury to Mike Piazza and Mo Vaughn, Valentine and the Mets essentially ran out of moves by the 10th inning. ''There wasn't much to do after a while,'' he said. Valentine finally saw an opening in the 14th. The Braves had two runners on with one out and Marcus Giles batting. Mets reliever Satoru Komiyama had pitched four and a third innings, and Valentine had closer Armando Benitez warming up in the bullpen. Valentine went to the mound and asked Komiyama if he could retire Giles, and Komiyama said yes. Valentine returned to the dugout. When Giles sent Komiyama's first-pitch slider into the first row of seats in left field for a three-run home run and a 5-2 Braves victory, Valentine slumped on the dugout railing. He felt that the one move he had made had backfired.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''I just wanted to make sure he was O.K.,'' Valentine said. ''I shouldn't have gone out and broken his concentration.''  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Komiyama, who played in Japan for 12 seasons, including one for Valentine, disagreed. ''I blame myself,'' he said through a translator. Each of the Mets could say the same. After outscoring the Braves by 20-5 in victories Friday and Saturday, they led by a run and were five outs from sweeping the series. Al Leiter, who overcame a wild first inning, walked and scored as the Mets built a 2-1 lead in the sixth. The newest Met, reliever Scott Strickland, began the eighth by retiring Julio Franco before Giles hit a grounder to third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo. Alfonzo's throw was low but catchable. The ball dribbled off Valentin's glove and toward the Braves' dugout for an error. Giles ran to second, with Valentine arguing in vain that he had not stepped on first. Javy Lopez struck out and B. J. Surhoff walked, then Mark DeRosa lined Strickland's 25th pitch to left and Giles scored the tying run. Strickland struck out Andruw Jones on three pitches to end the inning, slapping his glove as he walked off the mound. Valentin, a right-handed fielder, said he had reached too soon for the throw from Alfonzo. He brought his glove across his body and missed the ball.

Valentin, a longtime third baseman, made his first career start at first on Saturday because Vaughn's bruised right hand was aching. Valentin also made an error in that game, losing the ball while trying to tag Gary Sheffield on another off-line throw by Alfonzo.

Vaughn was watching from the dugout, in uniform but wearing sneakers rather than spikes. He and Valentin played together at Seton Hall and the two remained close during their years with the Boston Red Sox. ''First base is a position that if you do it right, it looks easy, but to get to that point is tough,'' Vaughn said. Referring to Valentin, he added: ''He's been on the other side of the infield his whole career. He sees the throws, but it's got to be comfortable; it's got to be second nature.'' The Braves left the bases loaded in the ninth against Grant Roberts, who was battling the flu, and David Weathers, who was pitching for the fifth time in the Mets' first six games. Komiyama, pitching for the second time in eight days and making only his fourth relief appearance since 1992, started the 10th and held the Braves scoreless into the 14th. Komiyama began the 14th by hitting Gary Sheffield with a pitch, then froze Vinny Castilla with a 68-mile-an-hour curveball for strike three. He walked Franco intentionally before Valentine approached him.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Without Piazza and Vaughn, Valentine had to have Komiyama bat twice. Komiyama walked in the top of the 14th and ran the bases. He had thrown 55 pitches by the time Valentine came to the mound. Benitez was available, but Valentine wanted to delay using him as long as possible. ''Can you do it?'' Valentine recalled asking Komiyama in Japanese. ''He smiled and said, 'Yeah,' in English.'' Giles, whose error helped the Mets score two runs in Saturday's 11-2 victory, drove the next pitch over the left-field wall to give the Braves a victory in the longest game -- by inning and by the clock -- at six-year-old Turner Field. ''It doesn't mean anything if we lose the game,'' Komiyama said of his four previous scoreless innings. Vaughn said Valentine had asked him if he could hit in the 13th inning, and Vaughn told him yes. Piazza, out with a bruised left knee, told Valentine that he could do whatever was needed, and he loosened up during the game. ''He didn't know it would be a 14-inning game,'' Piazza said. INSIDE PITCH JOHN FRANCO (sore left elbow) made 48 soft tosses without pain, although he attributed it to the effect of a cortisone shot he received Wednesday. He is at least a month away from joining the roster. . . . The game lasted 4 hours 59 minutes.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
