Heading into the latest edition of the world championships, which begin Aug. 28 in Turkey , the United States is a tenuous favorite to finally win again. Although the Americans dominated the 2008 Olympics, winning every game until the gold-medal match against Spain by an average of 30.2 points, no player from that roster will play this summer. That means the United States will go from a lineup that featured Kobe Bryant , LeBron James and Dwyane Wade to one filled with uncertainty. “Around the world we’re being referred to as the B Team,” said Jerry Colangelo , USA Basketball’s managing director. “We let our players know that the first night.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The linchpins of this edition will be the veterans Chauncey Billups and Lamar Odom , who will complement the budding stars Kevin Durant and Derrick Rose. But questions will dog this team, which will feature few experienced players and have a glaring lack of size and elite talent in the low post.

That leaves the center spot as the biggest question because the United States will probably bring the serviceable but unspectacular Brook Lopez and Tyson Chandler to man the post. “The basic question is: ‘What are we going to do up front? What about the bigs?’ ” Colangelo said. Expect the United States to showcase its versatility, with the 6-foot-10 Odom being perhaps the tallest player on the court at times. Coach Mike Krzyzewski said it was important with this team not to pigeonhole players to specific positions, as versatile hybrid players like Odom will see a lot of time.  Photo        O.J.

We’ll make up for our size in other areas.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Making up for experience could be trickier. Aside from Odom and Billups, a majority of the rest of the projected roster is composed of young players short on international experience. Rose and Durant will be the stars, and players like Russell Westbrook, Rajon Rondo, Stephen Curry and Kevin Love are all young enough to still be carded. “I think the biggest thing is that the teams we’re going to play have a lot of international experience; it’s something that we have to adjust to,” said Tony Ronzone, USA Basketball’s director of international player personnel.

The assistant coach Jim Boeheim, who often oversees the construction of teams for USA Basketball’s youth programs, said the key to building a roster for international play was to find a core of eight or nine players, then add a few specialists. The 2008 Olympic team, for example, had Tayshaun Prince for defense, Carlos Boozer for rebounding and toughness, and Michael Redd for 3-point shooting to complement its stars.  Photo        The core of this team projects to be Billups, Rose, Durant, Odom, Westbrook, Rondo, Chandler, Brook Lopez and Andre Iguodala. The specialists could be Curry for his 3-point shooting against the myriad zone defenses the United States expects to see, Love for his rebounding, and perhaps Rudy Gay for his scoring and versatility. “I think this is the most athletic team we’ve ever had,” Ronzone said. What is certain is that this team will be built around its strong crop of guards, with Durant providing the scoring punch from the frontcourt. “We have to look at this unconventionally,” Colangelo said. “We’re going to be very athletic and guard-oriented. We have versatility and guys who can play multiple positions.” In some of the previous international tournaments, players tended to overlook competition, and the teams turned into chemistry disasters. But with stability at the top in Colangelo and Krzyzewski and with a real USA Basketball system finally taking shape, this team is unlikely to overlook opponents or prepare poorly. The world has caught up to the United States in basketball, and while the United States reigns as the defending Olympic champion, the question this summer will be if the so-called B Team can be the best in the world.

That’s a long time.”   A version of this article appears in print on July 23, 2010, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Not the Redeem Team, But Still Chasing a Dream.
