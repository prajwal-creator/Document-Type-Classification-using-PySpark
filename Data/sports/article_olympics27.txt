But decreeing clemency, a move initiated by President Vladimir Putin, is not the same as acknowledging that these prisoners were improperly incarcerated to begin with. The amnesties actually came in stages. First, the Russian Parliament unanimously approved an amnesty bill proposed by Mr. Putin that would apply to several thousand Russian inmates, including Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, members of the band Pussy Riot who received two-year sentences for performing a “punk prayer” in Moscow’s main cathedral, and many arrested after an antigovernment demonstration in May. In a last-minute amendment, Parliament expanded the amnesty to suspects awaiting trial for “hooliganism,” which was taken to include the 30 members of Greenpeace arrested in the Arctic Sea in September. Then, as he concluded his annual marathon news conference on Thursday, Mr. Putin was asked about Mr. Khodorkovsky, once the richest man in Russia as the chief executive of Yukos Oil, whose imprisonment since 2003 has been widely condemned as political score-settling.

No doubt he was also trying to clear the slate of controversial cases in advance of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, which are already drawing Western protests in connection with Russia’s gay “propaganda” laws. In pardoning these prisoners, Mr. Putin gave no indication that they may have been wrongfully tried and imprisoned, nor that more people will not be treated similarly in the future. In fact, Mr. Putin’s press spokesman suggested that Mr. Khodorkovsky’s request for a pardon (which the prisoner’s lawyers could not confirm) was an acknowledgment of guilt.
