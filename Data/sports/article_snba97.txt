''On the show right before the game began, Bob Costas said, 'This may be the worst team ever put on the field in the Fall Classic,' '' Tom Lasorda, the Dodger manager, was saying now after a 4-3 victory over the Athletics. ''My players were screaming at him. I was trying to calm them down, but they were screaming, 'We'll show 'im,' and 'Kill Costas.' They were ready to play.'' Depleted by injuries, these Dodgers resembed a B squad that just got off a bus for a spring training game. But play these Dodgers did in taking a 3-1 lead with Orel Hershiser, alias Mr. Shutout, ready to pitch tonight's fifth game. ''This is without a doubt the greatest bunch of players I've ever been around,'' Lasorda added. ''They've never cheated me or their owner or themselves. And even if this turns around and the A's win, I'll still be the happiest manager ever to be in the Fall Classic. I told them that we're going to have to play without Mike Marshall and Kirk Gibson, but that we're not going to fold up the tent. I told them, 'If you give everything you have and play to the best of your abilities, you come off the field victorious.' And they did.''

Whatever it is, if the Dodgers win this World Series, Tom Lasorda deserves a bigger ring than that of any of his players, a ring bigger than a plate of linguine.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Perhaps never before in World Series history has a manager's emotional edge been so important to a team's success. Baseball is not supposed to be an emotional game. And over the regular season it seldom is. But in this World Series, as in the National League pennant playoff with the Mets that the Dodgers weren't supposed to win, Lasorda has stirred his players by pouncing on emotional subjects. And just as Costas's pre-game comments aroused the Dodgers, Lasorda's mention of them on the post-game show annoyed Tony LaRussa, the Athletics' manager. ''I'm a little aggravated right now,'' LaRussa said, ''because I heard this comment that one of the broadcasters said on the air that the Dodgers were the worst hitting club in the majors and that the Dodgers used that in their meeting. It's no big deal but I'd just like to know how they knew about that and how they used it in a meeting.'' LaRussa apparently thought that the comments had been made while the Dodgers were taking batting and fielding practice. But as Lasorda explained, they occurred on the pre-game show after the Dodgers had returned to their clubhouse.

And he approaches baseball as if it were a court case. Clinically, methodically. unemotionally. In the dugout, he's often by himself, sitting back in the dugout, peering intently at his pitcher or at his batter. And his team reflects his manner. Throughout this World Series, the muscular Athletics have been waiting patiently and unemotionally to hit home runs while the Dodgers put together their runs with paste and scissors. LASORDA, meanwhile, has used every emotional trick to stir his players, beginning with the second game against the Mets. After having lost the opener of that series, 3-2, on the Mets' ninth-inning rally, Lasorda knew he needed something to jolt his players and avoid a two-games-to-none deficit going to Shea Stadium. When he learned that David Cone, the Mets' right-hander who would start that game, had described Jay Howell as a ''high school pitcher'' and Hershiser has having been ''lucky,'' he had what he needed. The Dodgers won. In the hours before the fourth game, Lasorda learned that Howell had been suspended by Bart Giamatti, the National League president, for having had pine tar in his glove during the third game. In his clubhouse meeting, Lasorda exhorted his players to ''work together'' to make up for Howell's absence. They responded with a 5-4 victory in 12 innings. Before the seventh game of the Mets series, Lasorda kept talking about ''what a great team'' the Mets had, that the Dodgers were just ''happy to be on the same field'' with the National League East champions.

And except for Kirk Gibson's impersonation of Roy Hobbs that won the opener, 5-4, the Dodgers have had to play the A's without their best hitter. Early in the third game, the Dodgers lost their cleanup hitter, Mark Marshall, with a stiff back shortly after John Tudor walked off the mound with an ailing elbow. And last night they lost Mike Scioscia, their best catcher, with a damaged knee. ''But it's like I told my players,'' Lasorda said, ''about the guy who died two yards from shore after he swam and swam after a shipwreck. I told them, 'Don't be like that guy who swam and swam and died two yards from shore.' '' And how far, the Dodger manager was asked, are you from shore now? His eyes twinkling, Tom Lasorda smiled. ''One yard,'' he said.    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
