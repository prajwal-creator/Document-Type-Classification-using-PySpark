Only once, a long, long time ago when the ball was so dead that home run hitters rarely reached double digits and no team reached the World Series because it didn't begin until a year later. When the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates, managed by Fred Clarke, won the National League pennant by a record 27 1/2 games with a resounding 103-36 mark, three members of the team led the league in the three triple-crown categories. Ginger Beaumont, an outfielder, was the batting leader with a .357 average; Honus Wagner, the Hall of Fame shortstop, led in r.b.i. with 91, and Tommy Leach, the slugging third baseman, rapped 6 home runs, one more than any other player in the league. In the 85 seasons since then, there have been eight teams that have had two players win the three categories in the same year, and although three of those teams managed to reach the World Series, none of them won it. The players are: Cy Seymour and Fred Odwell of Cincinnati in 1905; Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford of pennant-winning Detroit in 1908; Ken Williams and George Sisler of the 1922 St. Louis Browns; Dolf Camilli and Pete Reiser of the Brooklyn Dodger pennant winners in 1941; Gus Zernial and Ferris Fain of the 1951 Philadelphia Athletics; Larry Doby and Bobby Avila of Cleveland's American League champions in 1954; Harmon Killebrew and Rod Carew of Minnesota in 1969; and Jim Rice and Wade Boggs of Boston in 1983. QUESTION: In the years in which Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs and Roger Maris hit 61 for the Yankees, who hit more homers on the road and who more at Yankee Stadium? Ruth belted one more on the road than Maris, who hit two more at home than Ruth. But in a home park so suitable for left-handed pull-hitters like Ruth and Maris, it's interesting to note that neither one hit more homers at the Stadium during his record year than he did on the road. For Ruth in 1927, the numbers were 32 away and 28 at home, with 25 percent of Ruth's road homers (8) coming at his former home field, Fenway Park in Boston. For Maris in 1961, there were 31 homers in stadiums other than his own, including five apiece in Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland. Maris had 30 homers at the Stadium, including his record-breaking final one of the season, something that Ruth did, too. QUESTION: The Team A batter has two strikes on him, with a teammate eagerly edging off third base, one out and no one else aboard. On the pitch, the batter is fooled so badly that he swings wildly, takes one hand off the bat and spins so rapidly that his bat strikes the Team B catcher in the back of the head as the catcher prepares to catch the pitch and then throw to third in an attempt to pick the runner off base to end the inning. Instead, the jarring from the bat forces the catcher to drop the pitch, and he has trouble locating the ball. If the batter reaches first base safely and the runner scoots home before a play can be made, will the run count?

If, in the judgment of the home-plate umpire, the batter deliberately bopped the catcher, he would be called out for interference no matter what the count was on him and he would probably incur another strike against him from Team B for being so reckless. If the catcher was accidentally hit by the swing, as happened in this example, no interference would be charged, but the umpire would acknowledge the third strike and excuse the dazed catcher from having to throw the batter out at first to obtain the putout. The umpire also would rule the ball dead and prohibit the runner from advancing home, setting up the following situation: two out, a runner on third and the pitcher rubbing up a new ball while the catcher is rubbing down the back of his head. QUESTION: When Wilt Chamberlain averaged better than 50 points a game for an entire season, who had the next best scoring average?

Besides outaveraging Baylor by 12.1 points a game, Chamberlain outscored the Laker forward by 2,193 points, 4,029 to 1,836. The player who was runner-up to Chamberlain in points scored that season was Walt Bellamy of the Chicago Packers, whose average of 31.6 was fashioned from 2,495 points scored. Even that total by Bellamy was 1,534 points fewer than what Chamberlain managed. QUESTION: Are the Cleveland Browns the only National Football League team without an emblem on their helmets? Indeed they are, and it's ironic that their predecessors in Cleveland, the Rams, created the first decorated helmet in the N.F.L. a year after the franchise was transferred from Cleveland to Los Angeles in 1946. Fred Gehrke, a halfback with Los Angeles from 1946-49 who later played with the San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Cardinals, painted Ram horns on the team helmets before the 1947 season, starting a trend that has been copied by every club but the one in the city he left.
