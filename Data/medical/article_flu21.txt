More than 300 people sent questions ( most can be read here). Part 1 of his answers is here ; part 2 of his answers is here . Dr. Buxton is also an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health and an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University . He studies chronic sleep deficiency in the workplace and home and how it contributes to disorders like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. (Note: Dr. Buxton is a researcher, not a physician, and he emphasizes that his responses should not take the place of recommendations from your health care provider.) This feature is now closed to new questions but remains open for discussion about sleep. Disclosure statement: Dr. Buxton’s current research is financed by several branches of the National Institutes of Health. He is a consultant to the Harvard School of Public Health Center for Work, Health and Well-being and is on the scientific advisory board for Matsutani America (a dietary fiber supplement manufacturer). He has served as an expert witness for Dinsmore L.L.C., received speaking/consulting fees from Takeda Inc., and was the principal investigator on investigator-initiated research financed by Cephalon Inc. (now Teva) and Sepracor Inc. (now Sunovion). The Sleepless Body Q. Concisely, what are the specific ramifications, in physiological terms, of consistently not getting enough sleep? — M, Chapel Hill, N.C.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A. Systems for regulating sleep and 24-hour internal circadian rhythms play a role in the regulation of essentially every system in the body. This means that chronic sleep deficiency has the potential to impact nearly all of our physiologic systems. After a night or two of insufficient sleep, sleepiness increases, and mood, concentration, memory and attention are poor with a narrowing of focus. Our appetite increases and food preferences become less healthy, and our energy levels drop, among many, many other changes.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Depending on the degree of sleep deficiency, days to a week or more of sleep loss result in continued degradation of performance, mood worsens and essentially all hormones in the body become imbalanced. Spontaneous pain increases . Immune system suppression kicks in: we are less likely to mount a response to a flu shot or a hepatitis B vaccination , and are more likely to catch a common cold or pneumonia . So, in addition to your flu shot, consider getting some sleep before and after. Glucose metabolism is altered in ways that increase obesity and diabetes risk. In the long term, we know that a “lifestyle” of sleep deficiency is associated with many chronic conditions , including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes and early mortality. These physiologic changes drive changes in health behaviors; we are more likely to eat poorly and obtain less vigorous exercise when we are sleep deficient. We are more likely to turn to other less healthy countermeasures, like excessive caffeine, stimulants and junk food. To exacerbate this, we often find ourselves in front of the television or screens for longer than might be best for getting the sleep we need. Blue-enriched L.E.D. screens in most computers and displays have a direct alerting effect, and disrupt our circadian system more than regular light, suppressing melatonin. Reversing Damage Q. If one goes from a sleep-deficient lifestyle to a sleep-sufficient lifestyle, can one reverse related damage? — Tuck, New York City A. The short answer, Tuck, is “we don’t know.” It probably matters a great deal if sleep deficiency can be measured in months or years compared with decades in duration, and what kind of sleep deficiency is involved: short sleep duration, and/or poor sleep quality (as with regular disruptions, or a sleep disorder). This is an active area of investigation and part of the federal government’s “Healthy People 2020” goals — finding ways to help people get the sleep they need, or the sleep disorder treatment that works for them, and how this might improve health in the future. A current research focus is on prevention, by improving sleep to avoid chronic disease. We have less information on reversal of metabolic aging or other sleep deficiency-related damage. In laboratory studies that evaluated the performance and metabolism of healthy people subjected to sleep restriction of some kind, the recovery of function was usually observed in days to a week. It is important to note that these people started out healthy, and the effects appeared reversible. The chronic diseases usually associated with sleep deficiency chronic diseases (as mentioned above) are usually more “managed” more than fully “cured.” Workplace Well-Being Q. How can you and other researchers publicize the hidden but massive costs imposed by inflexible workplace management so that managers learn to do better by their employees? The short-term emphasis on benchmarks and cutting costs, at the longer-term expense of institutional health, employee well-being, customer service and societal balance is very destructive. — Dean, U.S. A. Businesses should be concerned about worker sleep health, as Dean points out, for the many destructive impacts of having a narrow, short-term focus. Coincidentally, this narrowness of focus mirrors the mental state of sleep-deprived individuals. In the United States, being at work but not fully functional because of insomnia (called “presenteeism”) has been estimated to cost $63 billion annually. We have evidence of multiple pathways by which the workplace impacts health and wellness. Management can either be a part of the problem, or be a part of long-term solutions. We need evidence-based solutions that both improve worker health and benefit employers. Stay tuned. We also need a platform for broader conversations, like this Booming blog, than academic journals offer, because in part this is a social problem of cultural norms around balancing work and nonwork, the corporation and the individual.

Do I need to sleep eight hours, more or less, each night, or can I make up lost sleep over a week? What is the span over which “lost sleep” can be recovered? — Poppy, Atlanta  Photo        Orfeu Marcello Buxton, neuroscientist and sleep researcher.    A. The consistency of sleep duration and sleep timing matter, and they are both central components of “sleep hygiene.” Consistently getting regularly timed sleep, when possible, means that our internal, 24-hour circadian clock is on the same internal “time zone” as we want to live in synch with our lifestyle, and this can help us get to sleep and stay asleep. “Social jet lag,” or sleeping short on workdays and longer yet later on days off, can negatively affect mood, performance and obesity risk. Napping during long shifts may be useful in some circumstances — though perhaps not as much as claimed in this novel study unearthed by The Onion. Making consistent sleep duration a habit can help us resist the ceaseless pressures to meet just one more deadline, to see one more show, or read one more post. Sleep as a priority, along with healthful diet and plenty of exercise, will position us for success in life. That said, the advice is to consistently get the amount of sleep that you need, which might be more or less than eight hours per night. In part 1 , I describe how to tell how much sleep you might need and provide a nonclinical litmus test to determine if you are getting enough. It takes more than sleeping-in once or twice to catch up after chronic sleep loss. Sleep Apnea Q. Sleep apnea is characterized by sometimes hundreds of periods of airway obstruction every night. In each one, sleepers eventually startle partly awake due to dropping blood oxygen level, and start breathing again. They often wake up exhausted, but have no awareness of why. My ex-husband snored terribly, and seriously disturbed my sleep for over 10 years. Finally one morning instead of just complaining about him snoring, I reported (truthfully), “Last night I was awake again, because you were snoring again, and at one point, I counted to 11-Mississippi, and you were not breathing that entire time.” That did it! He was an engineer, and he needed a number. He was at the doctor within a week, and at the sleep lab within another week. They wired him up, and he went to sleep. They woke him up after an hour and said: “You definitely have sleep apnea. The rest of the night is just to document how bad it is.” He got a CPAP, took some weeks and a refitting or two to get adjusted to it, and came to swear by it. — Ellie, Massachusetts A. I mentioned some detrimental effects of obstructive sleep apnea in an earlier response, but wanted to expand upon this great comment from Ellie. Apnea or sleep-disordered breathing provokes wide-ranging problems, and much more than excessive daytime sleepiness. Increased risk of chronic diseases like heart diseases and diabetes emerge from having sleep-disordered breathing. Low oxygen levels in the blood overnight is a contributing factor, but lack of truly restful and restorative sleep is a contributing factor to the long-term consequences. Morning headaches, dry mouth and throat, erectile dysfunction and many other symptoms can emerge. Not only is life shortened by apnea, but the quality of that shorter life may also be diminished, including cognitive decline. So who sees a doctor for this? Anecdotally, a common reason “he” goes to see a doctor (since it’s more common in men), is that his bed partner can no longer tolerate their own insomnia. Loud snoring and struggling to breath can be a sleep disruptor, but spouse/partner support is conducive to good health. If sleep apnea is diagnosed, successful treatment is not something everyone can tolerate, but again, the partner’s support is a strong predictor of successful treatment. Treatment of apnea can improve the bed partner’s quality of life , too. Alcohol Effects Q. I am surprised that the effect of alcohol consumption on sleep was not discussed. As we age, it seems that even moderate alcohol consumption can really disrupt sleep. — Abby Dye, San Francisco   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A. Excess alcohol is clearly disruptive to sleep. The sedating properties might help one fall asleep but the ensuing sleep is often lighter and more disrupted. And snoring and sleep apnea, if present, can be made worse by alcohol consumption. Afternoon or evening alcohol can lighten and fragment subsequent sleep. Alcohol-infused sleep is not the most restorative and blocks the deepest stages of sleep early in the night. Evening alcohol is inhibitory for the sleep-related release of growth hormone that typically occurs early in the night and helps maintain our physical infrastructure, like leanness, skin elasticity, bone strength, etc. After several hours of this light sleep, and as blood alcohol levels go down, there are often extended awakenings, maybe with a headache to make it even more fun. Additionally, alcohol is a diuretic, so sleep can be disrupted by the need to urinate. So, while it might seem as if alcohol helped with getting to sleep, we know that the sleep is less restorative, lighter and more broken. Since sleep already grows lighter as we age , even moderate alcohol consumption can disrupt sleep, and is a poor choice for an insomnia treatment. Effects of Caffeine, Too Q. Please comment on the effects of caffeine and alcohol - the two biggest causes of American sleep deprivation and sleepiness. —Primum Non Nocere, San Francisco A. Excess caffeine and alcohol contribute to poor sleep, and poor sleep habits. Although I’ve heard the hypothesis that coffee was part of the Enlightenment, and writing and computer work do seem to improve (only in the short term) with caffeine, performance is actually better if we don’t NEED the caffeine in the long run. We develop a tolerance to the effects of caffeine that reduces caffeine’s effectiveness. If we got enough sleep coffee would be less “necessary,” and might actually work better if our tolerance was lower for when we needed a boost in a pinch. An estimated 83 percent of Americans drink coffee . Caffeine lurks in chocolate, and even some kinds of gum – prompting the F.D.A. to examine the effects of caffeine in food on health, including for kids. High school students, perhaps the most sleep deprived segment of the United States, consume large quantities of energy drinks and sodas.   Interestingly, Americans may be drinking coffee with the wrong timing and dosing. Upon awaking, and after having had sleep should be the most rested one can be all day. A large amount of coffee to start the day helps ensure that the addiction to caffeine is maintained. Sleep inertia, the persistence of a sleep-like state upon waking, is the time needed for the frontal parts of our brain to come online, and takes about 15-45 minutes. A large morning caffeine dose wears off and results in a crash later in the morning and early afternoon, only to be fixed by more caffeine. Fewer and smaller caffeine doses reduce the anxious and excitable peaks and the valleys of tiredness across the day, and make it easier to respond to our internal drive for sleep at bedtime.
