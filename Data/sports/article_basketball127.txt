RHODEN    MARCH 12, 2011      Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           Masai Ujiri moved easily around the city last week. Having breakfast in Times Square, standing in line in a drizzle to pick up a ticket for the Big East men’s basketball tournament, walking through Madison Square Garden, Ujiri rubbed elbows with New Yorkers who had no idea that he had either given the Knicks new life or snatched a piece of their future, depending on your perspective. Three weeks ago, Ujiri, the Denver Nuggets ’ vice president for basketball operations, and the team president Josh Kroenke engineered a blockbuster trade that energized the Knicks and redefined the Nuggets. The deal sent Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups to the Knicks for Raymond Felton, Wilson Chandler, Danilo Gallinari and Timofey Mozgov. It ended a six-month ordeal that began when Ujiri took the job last August and felt “like five years,” Ujiri said. He said he had wanted to keep Anthony and saw himself as the hero who would find a way to keep a superstar in “a small market.” Ujiri, 40, generally shuns the spotlight, but he made headlines after the Anthony trade. With typical candor, he told reporters, “We got killed.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In fact, Denver made out pretty well. The trade gave the Knicks hope, but it gave Denver a core of talented young players to build around.

But we lost a superstar, and one of my jobs as vice president of this team is to find that next guy or to put a team together that’s going to compete for a championship.” Hence, Ujiri’s presence at the Big East and Big 12 tournaments, and his plans to travel north, south, east and west during the N.C.A.A. tournament. “The trade will judge itself in years to come,” he said. “The owners are happy, the fans are happy and my basketball coach is happy.” Last week, the Nuggets and Coach George Karl agreed to a multiyear contract extension. Ujiri is reluctant to talk about individual accomplishment and takes pains to call attention to the team. Modesty aside, his journey to the N.B.A. could be a template for success: humility, tenacity, persistence and finally a commitment to showing a younger generation how to chase dreams and make them reality.

The family moved back to its native Nigeria when he was 2; at 13 he discovered basketball and said goodbye to soccer. His dream became an obsession: to play professionally and someday reach the N.B.A. Ujiri attended a prep school in Seattle, where he stayed with a Nigerian family. He then attended junior college in Bismarck, N.D., with a friend who had told him that the team needed players. From there Ujiri went to Montana State, though he left early for a six-year pro career with B-level teams throughout Europe.  It was in Denmark that Ujiri began to take stock of his life — and his dream.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He began to read and study the N.B.A. and its front-office positions and responsibilities. He possessed an expansive knowledge of basketball in Europe and a wide array of contacts.

They were impressed with his easy manner and incisive knowledge of players, where they came from and their abilities. In 2003, John Gabriel, then the Orlando Magic’s general manager, began giving Ujiri scouting assignments. A year later, Kiki Vandeweghe, as the Nuggets’ general manager, hired Ujiri to be an international scout. Toronto offered Ujiri a job in 2006, and a year later he was promoted to assistant general manager. When the Nuggets’ basketball operations post opened last year, Kroenke asked Ujiri to fly to Denver for an interview. He was hired shortly thereafter. Ujiri has two major goals. The first is building Denver into a championship team. The second is establishing basketball in Africa. Ujiri has dedicated himself to helping other Africans follow his path. In 2003, he developed a camp in Nigeria for top  young basketball players. Then he added a camp for players 6 feet 8 inches and taller.  The annual Top 50 and Big Man camps have become destinations for high school, college and professional scouts.  Two players who passed through Ujiri’s camps  are Connecticut’s Charles Okwandu and Louisville’s Gorgui Dieng, whose teams met Saturday night for the Big East championship. “There are a lot of good, smart kids there who just need an opportunity,” Ujiri said. “I represent a great continent. People ask, Is there pressure on me? I don’t feel pressure at all. It’s an unbelievable challenge for me, but I feel like I carry the weight of my continent on my shoulders. I want to help the next generation in Africa.” Ujiri is clearing a pretty impressive path.
