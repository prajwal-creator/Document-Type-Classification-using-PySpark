''It was an invasion.'' The president of Towson State University, Dr. Smith counts himself among the members of the self-styled expeditionary force - the 198 college presidents and chancellors who appointed themselves delegates to the two-day special convention of the National Collegiate Athletic Association - and left an indelible mark on the future of intercollegiate athletics. There are 797 colleges and universities that belong to the N.C.A.A., from tiny liberal arts colleges that cling to the ideals of scholar-athlete in its purest form to large state universities with presidents who would gladly swap salaries with their football and basketball coaches. The association's conventions thus tend to be as gangly and restless as the adolescents who play its games. High Proportion of Mesomorphs Visitors to an N.C.A.A. meeting are often struck by the physical size of the delegates. Most athletic directors, after all, are former athletes, so the proportion of mesomorphs in their ranks is well above the national average. N.C.A.A. meetings are typically dominated by athletic directors and faculty representatives. This special convention, though, was convened by the newly formed Presidents' Commission, and it was clear from the opening gavel that the presidents and chancellors were intent on making their presence felt. When the first proposition, calling for a self-study of athletic programs every five years, passed easily, it was clear that the presidents would have their way. Donna Lopiano, the former women's basketball coach at Brooklyn College who is now director of women's athletics at the University of Texas, raised a point about due process in future sanctions against student-recruiting code violators, but she was the only athletic director to take the floor. ''You don't argue during an invasion,'' reminded Dr. Smith.

One of the N.C.A.A.'s quaint customs has been to equip each institution's delegation with a ''paddle'' - a seven-inch-long piece of plastic shaped like a butcher's knife. The paddles are color coded - blue for Division I, red for II and yellow for III - and when it comes time for a hand vote delegates wave their respective paddles in the air, making the convention floor look like the card section at a football game. There are those who speculate that, in the past, paddles have not always been waved in accordance with a publicly stated position of some chief executive, especially those who chose to stay home and send others in their place. This time voting on the 12 propositions was done on cards that were then collected and fed into a computer. The resulting printout provided not only a tally of the votes but a public record of where each college stood on each issue.

''The N.C.A.A. got religion,'' said the Rev. Timothy Healy, the president of Georgetown University. ''It was a remarkable conversion.''
