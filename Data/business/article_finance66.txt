A second set of sanctions under consideration is a cutoff of North Korean banking relationships, similar to the restrictions placed on Iran in the successful effort to drive it to the negotiation table on its nuclear program.

During President George W. Bush’s administration, the United States shut down transactions at one particular institution, Banco Delta Asia in Macau, that was used by the North Korean leadership, including Kim Jong-il, the country’s leader at the time. That caused considerable pain — the bank was used to finance the lifestyles of many in the North Korean elite — but eventually the Bush administration relented and lifted the sanction, in part because of pressure from the government then in place in South Korea. The Treasury Department has identified similar institutions used by Mr. Kim’s son, the current leader, Kim Jong-un . The most effective step against North Korea, most experts believe, would be the one that the Chinese most oppose: a restriction or cutoff of oil exports to the North. The country is highly dependent on oil that runs through a small number of pipelines from China. “We just think it would be a nonstarter with the Chinese,” said one American official, who said that it would be counterproductive if the inclusion of an oil ban led the Chinese to veto the entire resolution. China’s fear is that without oil, the North Korean regime could collapse, putting South Korea, and its American ally, on the Chinese border.

One is an overflight of the border between North and South Korea with a nuclear-capable bomber, the B-52 or the B-2. Such flights were sent up after North Korea’s third nuclear test, in 2013.

South Korean and American officials said there was also renewed discussion of deploying an advanced missile defense system, called the Thaad for Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, in South Korea. The United States has been pressing for such a deployment for some time, but the South has resisted, largely because of opposition from China, which is the South’s leading trade partner.

The United States itself has imposed many sanctions against North Korea, including some a year ago in response to the destructive cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, which the Obama administration said had emanated from North Korean leaders. But without Chinese participation, those sanctions inflict relatively little pain. While American officials worked up sanctions possibilities, South Korea on Friday resumed the propaganda broadcasts that infuriated the North last summer .  Video   South Korea Switches On Loudspeakers    South Korea resumes propaganda broadcasts, ​including K-pop​, against the North across the border using loudspeakers, a step that has angered Pyongyang in the past.

Watch in Times Video »         embed            The South turned on about 10 batteries of so-called propaganda loudspeakers at the heavily armed border at noon on Friday, the Defense Ministry said. In August, the Koreas appeared on the verge of armed conflict partly because of the broadcasts, which the South used to blare news of the outside world and criticism of the North, as well as bouncy South Korean pop music , into the tightly controlled country. South Korea’s decision to turn on the loudspeakers was made Thursday, when top national security officials met in Seoul to discuss a response to the North’s test. South Korean officials said privately on Thursday that resuming the propaganda broadcasts was the simplest and quickest way they could think of, for now, to retaliate. They insisted on anonymity while agreeing to discuss their thinking on a delicate security issue. Like the United States, the South has few options for punishing the North for its nuclear ambitions, which it has continued to pursue despite decades of international sanctions and resolutions from the United Nations Security Council.   North Korea did not immediately respond to the resumption of the broadcasts. While loudspeakers may seem like a trivial response to a nuclear test, there is little doubt that the broadcasts enrage the North Korean leadership, which rigorously controls what information its citizens receive and sees the propaganda as an attempt to undermine its authority. The Cold War-era tactic had gone unused by the South for 11 years until last summer, after two South Korean border guards were maimed by land mines , which the South accused the North of planting.

The crisis was defused after top officials from both Koreas met in talks at the border on Aug. 25. North Korea expressed “regret” over the wounding of the border guards, and South Korea agreed to stop the broadcasts unless an “abnormal situation” developed.   David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.
