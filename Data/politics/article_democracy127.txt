Weeks later, tax-exempt status in hand as well as a single $4 million donation from an anonymous benefactor, the group kicked off a multimillion-dollar campaign against 11 Democratic candidates, declining to report any of its political spending to the Federal Election Commission, maintaining to the I.R.S. that it did not do any political spending at all, and failing to register as a political committee required to disclose the names of its donors. Then, faced with multiple election commission and I.R.S. complaints, the group went out of business. To Democrats and some campaign finance watchdogs eager to force more transparency in spending by independent groups, Hope, Growth and Opportunity stands out as the kind of “pop-up” organization that operates in virtual secrecy, with legal impunity. “I still don’t know who they are,” said John Spratt, the former chairman of the House Budget Committee, who lost his 2010 re-election bid after facing a deluge from the group. “It’s a classic case.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Efforts to require more public accounting of campaign money hit a new roadblock Monday evening in the form of a Republican filibuster that stopped the Senate from formally debating it. The measure fell 9 votes short of the 60 required to clear the procedural hurdle, with no Republicans voting in favor. But Democratic senators planned to keep discussing the bill — the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act — into the night, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, voted no so that under Senate rules, he could bring it up for a second vote on Tuesday to highlight Republican opposition.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Republicans blasted the effort as grandstanding at a time when the nation faces far more pressing challenges. “This amounts to nothing more than member and donor harassment and intimidation, and it’s all part of a broader government-led intimidation effort by this administration,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who once advocated broader disclosure but has become the legislation’s fiercest critic. Advocacy groups say the lesson of the Commission on Hope, Growth and Opportunity is that the nation’s campaign finance laws are in tatters, and without changes, such organizations will proliferate.

Since the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, prominent nonprofit organizations like Priorities USA, which supports Democrats, and Crossroads GPS, which backs Republicans, have pulled in tens of millions of dollars from anonymous donors to focus on high-profile contests, like the presidential race. But groups like Hope, Growth and Opportunity can serve as a conduit for large donors focused on races beneath the radar. The main donor behind Hope, Growth and Opportunity appeared intent on knocking off Mr. Spratt, a House veteran from South Carolina and one of only three committee chairmen who lost in the 2010 Republican tsunami. The group’s initial spokesman was Scott Reed, a prominent Republican strategist who managed Bob Dole’s 1996 presidential campaign. Its officers included Steven Powell, a Republican media consultant; James Warring, a Maryland certified public accountant; and William B. Canfield, a longtime Republican lawyer. Its application to the I.R.S. said it did not plan to spend any money trying to influence the selection, nomination, election or appointment of any person to federal, state or local public office. Instead, it would exist to advance “the principle that sustained and expanding economic growth is central to America’s future.” The group raised $4.8 million, $4 million from one contributor. Mr. Reed, now a senior strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s political efforts, declined to discuss Hope, Growth and Opportunity. Mr. Canfield called the group a client, not an employer, and said he had not had contact with it since signing its 2010 tax return early last year. The group’s other officers did not respond to phone calls. But the promotion of economic growth was at best indirect. Within weeks of winning the I.R.S.’s designation as a “social welfare organization,” the group began running the first of nearly a half-million dollars in ads in South Carolina depicting Mr. Spratt as a profligate spender. It encouraged voters to join his Republican opponent, Mick Mulvaney, in his “fight against the big spenders in Washington.”   A version of this article appears in print on July 17, 2012, on Page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Tax-Exempt Group’s Election Activity Highlights Limits of Campaign Finance Rules.
