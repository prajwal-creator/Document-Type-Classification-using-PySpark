There was general bipartisan agreement t hat the proposed increase in military s pending should be scaled back in an effort to reduce the deficit a nd subject the Pentagon to the same scrutiny social programs unde rgo. But some in Congress said it would be difficult, if not impossible, to make cuts in military spending that would substantially reduce the projected deficit of $91.5 billion for the fiscal year 1983. There was also a bipartisan expectation that the President's problems in selling his proposal would be exacerbated by the fact that he no longer had the goal of a balanced budget to use as an incentive for making spending cuts.

They predicted that, as in the 1980 election year, Congress would return after Election Day for a special session that would include adoption of the budget. Republican Congressional leaders said that they would initially forgo the kind of omnibus ''reconciliation'' package used last year, in which hundreds of changes in the laws were made in order to effectsavings and increase revenues. The package le d to widespread resentment that the regular Congressional pro cesses were being undermined. David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, noted Congressional hostility to another reconciliation package, and said that ''the same thing usually doesn't work twice.'' He added, however, that reconciliation might be used selectively. Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the Republican whip, described himself as ''sort of in a state of shock'' upon learning that ''the deficit could be as high as it's projected.'' He noted that the deficit ''was based on the assumption that the President will receive the approval of Congress of 100 percent of what he's requested.'' He considers that unrealistic and therefore expects the deficit to climb. Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said, ''The Republicans I've talked with are frightened about the deficit.'' He called the President's proposal ''a credible budget'' but one that needed ''a lot of work.'' A key Republican Senate committee chairman, who asked not to be identified, said of the budget: ''It's a bear. It's going to be extremely difficult to do.''

Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee, the majority leader, was home recovering from the flu and said that David A. Stockman, the budget director, planned to drop by to give him a private briefing. But he added that he would have no comment until the middle of next week. No Comment from Domenici Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, also limited himself to a terse ''no comment.'' Democrats, however, were under no such constraints. They emphasized what they considered the callous character of the Administration.  Senator Gary Hart, Democrat of Colorado, said, ''The Administration understands that its mandate is about to run out, and the radicals in the Administration are pressing for all they can get.'' He added that the proposed cuts in social programs ''essentially eliminate the ladder of opportunity.'' Senator Alan Cranston of California, the Democratic whip, denounced the budget as ''unfair, unwise, unworkable and unrealistic,'' and asserted that ''the deficits are going to be larger than the President predicts.''

Jones, Democrat of Oklahoma, chairman of the Budget Committee, called the deficit ''too large'' and added that ''unless we get the deficits under control we'll have high interest rates that will frustrate recovery.'' 'Lack of Compassion' Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, Democrat of Queens, called the budget ''another indication of the lack of compassion exhibited by this Administration since it took office last year.'' The specter of burgeoning budget deficits appeared to have created an unlikely alliance between Republican and Democratic members of Congress, and they urged the President to scale back the growth in military spending. Senator Dole spoke of ''a growing consensus among Republicans that defense is not off limits'' in seeking ways to reduce the deficit. The near un animity was suggested by Senator William L. Armstrong, a conservativ e Republican of Colorado. ''When hawks like me are talking about cutting military spending,'' he said, ''you know something is in the wind.'' Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, said: ''Most of the members feel that they went along with a precipitious increase in defense spending last year, and that you can't have that two years in a row. With the kind of deficits we're looking at here, and the need to cut expenditures, you just can't leave defense out of there.'' Senator Baker has urged cuts of $5 billion to $10 billion in the President's military budget. Hot Topic in Iowa Senator Charles E. Grassley, a conservative Republican of Iowa, said: ''I just spent two weeks touring 27 counties in western Iowa, speaking in 27 courthouses, and there wasn't a meeting where concern with the rapid escalation of defense spending didn't come up. The perception that people in Iowa have is that defense is a sacred cow here in Washington.''

''There were some sparks flying,'' said Rep resentative Lawrence J. DeNardis, Republican of Connecticut. ''The ed ucation budget is scheduled for a 30 percent reduction, and at the same time the defense budget is going to be increased 15 pe rcent. That's absolutely indefensible.'' Despite the general bipartisan conviction that the military budget should be cut, Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, has warned that substantial cuts could come only from those areas in which the military is weakest: personnel, operations and maintenance and research and development. The reason is that most of the funds budgeted for those areas were spent in the immediate budget year. Mr. Aspin contends that those are precisely the areas of greatest military need.  ''We don't have enough military personnel, we don't have enough spare parts, practice rounds or flying time for pilots,'' he said. Top-Heavy Budget for Next Year Bombers, aircraft carriers and other major purchases are made over a number of years, and only a relatively small proportion of the spending is included in next year's budget. But that budget is topheavy with funds for personnel, maintenance and research, which will be spent in the next fiscal year. Therefore, when Congress seeks to make major savings in military spending, to reduce the pending deficit, it cuts precisely those areas that have a direct effect on combat readiness. Mr. Aspin, who is on both the Budget and the Armed Services Comnmittees, notes that most critics of military spending concentrate their rhetoric on the so-called big-ticket items, but adds that these yield only small savings in the immediate year. If those big-ticket items were eliminated from the budget for the fiscal year 1983, Mr. Aspin said, they would yield savings of only $5.8 billion. This would include eliminating the MX, saving $2.4 billion; the B-1 bomber, for $497 million; two nuclear carriers, for $194 million, the F-18, for $225 million, and a variety of lesser weapons. Mr. Aspin recommends a long-range approach to military reductions, which would concentrate on procurement of ships, aircraft, missiles, tanks and ammunition, rather than on personnel, operations and maintenance and research and development.
