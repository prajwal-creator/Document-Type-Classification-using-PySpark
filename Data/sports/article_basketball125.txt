More than 700 stores will stay open late in New York tonight.   Credit Casey Kelbaugh for The New York Times     WHAT do Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift and Kendall Jenner have in common? Aside from the obvious (idols of the OMG-generation), they’re campaigners for the fourth annual Fashion’s Night Out . The shopping extravaganza, which chaotically collides with New York Fashion Week , is taking over the city again on Thursday. Over 500 cities in 19 countries will participate this year. In New York, major brands like Ralph Lauren and Gucci have scaled back their participation. Even so, more than 700 stores will stay open late. As before, there will be limited-edition merchandise, musical performances, free drinks, special deals, celebrity sightings and, oh, a few fashion designers. Go by neighborhood or, if you’re more discerning, hop by theme. (Karaoke, anyone?) Taxi tip: don’t expect to hail any, especially near retail areas. For more information, go to the hyperorganized event Web site, fashionsnightout.com . Or see our top picks for the rollicking evening: A is for Azealia The Harlem rapper and lyricist Azealia Banks has parlayed her indie buzz into a T by Alexander Wang campaign. If that hasn’t anointed her into fashion’s front row, then her performance at MAC’s SoHo store just might. The cosmetics brand is also selling a limited-edition semi-matte lipstick in a dark plum called Yung Rapunxel ($15), named after Ms. Banks’s alter ego. MAC SoHo, 506 Broadway, 7 to 10 p.m. B is for Babies In contrast to the general circus mood, Carolina Herrera has planned a child-friendly carnival at her Madison Avenue shop. The designer teamed with Jessica Seinfeld’s charity Baby Buggy for an evening of magic shows, face painting and balloon animals. Tots and moms can walk away with limited edition, matching leather wrap bracelets for $50 each.
