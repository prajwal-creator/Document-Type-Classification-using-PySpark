The Letter To the Editor: Every four years a handful of the same old states effectively pick party nominees for president, voting earlier and earlier with campaign spending mattering more and more. The parties should winnow their field with what is known as the American Plan , a nomination schedule that rewards retail campaigning and gives late-entering candidates a better chance. Ten biweekly rounds of voting would be held, starting in small states. Delegates would be allocated proportionally rather than by winner take all. Up to three candidates for each party would earn a place in a national primary, held in June in conjunction with Congressional primaries.

For Congressional elections, creating larger districts with several seats and a proportional voting system to allow more voters to elect a preferred candidate would better represent the left, the right and the center. With these changes, all Americans could be engaged in our presidential elections, not just the favored few of Iowa, New Hampshire and the other early primary and caucus states. And we just might regularly end up with better presidents and members of Congress. ROB RICHIE Takoma Park, Md., Feb. 6, 2012 The writer is executive director of FairVote, which promotes election reform. Readers React There is no need for Mr. Richie’s ridiculously complicated scheme, which won’t be enacted in anyone’s lifetime. All that is necessary to prevent a couple of small, unrepresentative states from dominating presidential primary campaigns is for the Legislatures of California, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan to enact a simple amendment to their respective election codes: The date of the presidential primary in each such state shall be whatever date is selected by the New Hampshire secretary of state for that year’s primary in New Hampshire. Having the millions of voters in those populous states heard the same day as the nine fine voters in Dixville Notch will inject a dose of much-needed sanity into the electoral process. RICHARD G. LISKOV Bronx, Feb. 8, 2012  The defense of the primacy of Iowa and New Hampshire is that these states reward “retail politics,” and the American Plan follows suit, allowing small states to go first.

Focusing on retail politics overromanticizes an era without mass media. Consider how much we have learned from the series of Republican debates, information that would never be disseminated in a town hall. We live in a time of “wholesale” media consumption, and our nominating process should reflect that as well. KEVIN STEVENS Buffalo, Feb. 8, 2012  Some of the reforms that Mr. Richie mentions could ameliorate problems in the selection of a president, but ranked-choice voting is not among them. This voting reform suffers from three main difficulties. The first is that the majority choice, who could beat every other candidate in paired contests, may be dropped when candidates are eliminated sequentially. For example, if a Tea Party Republican, a regular Republican and a Democrat are the three main contenders, the regular Republican will often come in third, hit from both the left (by the Democrat) and the right (by the Tea Party Republican). So this candidate will be dropped, even though he or she could have defeated each opponent in a face-to-face contest. Second, if none of the candidates that a voter ranks survive the elimination process, this voter has no say in the final selection. Third, a voter can actually hurt a candidate by raising the candidate in his or her ranking. This bizarre result is unfortunately common in close elections. It occurs because a candidate’s higher ranking can change who is eliminated and whose votes get transferred. The net effect, perversely, can mean that the candidate given the boost does not survive when, without the boost, he or she might ultimately have won. For these reasons, it is not surprising that Burlington, Vt., and Aspen, Colo., two cities that tried out ranked-choice voting, have now repealed it. There are now serious efforts to repeal it in other cities because of its unfortunate, if unintended, effects. A simple election reform that generally avoids the foregoing problems is approval voting, whereby voters can approve of as many candidates as they like. Each approved candidate receives one vote, and the candidate with the most approval votes wins. Approval voting almost always elects the majority choice, gives every voter a say (whether he or she approves of few or many candidates), and never hurts a candidate if more voters approve of him or her.

BRAMS New York, Feb. 9, 2012 The writer is a professor of politics at New York University and author of “Mathematics and Democracy: Designing Better Voting and Fair-Division Procedures.”  There is a vast array of alternatives to our current electoral system, and by allowing voters to rank candidates, most alternatives enable voters to express their preferences much more deeply than our current system. The economist and Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow proved that there is no perfectly fair voting system, and there remains substantial debate in the mathematical and political science communities about the optimal voting system. What is not in doubt, however, is that almost any serious alternative offers substantial improvements over our current system. The difficulty with carrying out attractive systems like instant runoff voting, however, is that they offer real promise for third-party candidates. As such, these systems pose a direct threat to our entrenched political parties, which appear more concerned with maintaining political control than in initiating meaningful change. It is in the best interest of these parties that attempts to reform our voting system be squelched.

One aspect of the current procedure that particularly cries out for reform is the caucus system. Not only are caucuses incompetently run and error-prone — as your Feb. 3 article “ A Symbol of Democracy Is Criticized as Undemocratic “ revealed of the recent Iowa gathering — but they also effectively exclude many voters and allow for voter intimidation. Unlike a primary vote, which usually takes only a few minutes, a caucus requires an onerous commitment of time and effort, thereby excluding those who have other obligations, like child care or second jobs, or who are not able-bodied. Moreover, most caucuses do not use the secret ballot, a time-honored feature of fair elections, which protects the right of the individual to make up his or her mind free from societal coercion.

JOSEPHINE DONOVAN Portsmouth, N.H., Feb. 8, 2012  Mr. Richie is right that “instant runoff” voting (in which voters rank candidates in order of preference, and candidates are successively eliminated according to whoever has the fewest first-place votes in the remaining pool) would be a real improvement over the current plurality rule system. In particular, it would reduce the chance that candidate A wins an election even though a majority of voters actually prefer candidate B, a frequent occurrence under plurality rule. (For example, in the 2000 presidential contest in Florida, Al Gore, almost certainly, was preferred by a majority to George W. Bush, but Mr. Gore failed to win Florida — and therefore the overall election — because nearly 100,000 voters opted for Ralph Nader.) In that respect, there is an even better election method: “true majority rule,” in which the winner is the candidate who, according to voters’ rankings, would beat every other candidate in a head-to-head contest. But as long as we are making reforms, why not go a step further and get rid of primary elections altogether? Under the current system, it would be disastrous for a party to send multiple candidates into the general election. If, for example, both Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton had run in the fall of 2008, they would have split the Democratic vote, ensuring the victory of John McCain, the Republican. Thus, primaries are needed to select a party’s single standard-bearer. Yet with either instant runoff or true-majority voting, there is no danger of vote-splitting: Democratic voters could rank both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton above Mr. McCain, and so the need for primaries is obviated. ERIC S. MASKIN Cambridge, Mass., Feb. 9, 2012 The writer is a professor of economics at Harvard University and a 2007 Nobel laureate in economics.  I support Mr. Richie’s proposal, especially that part of the American Plan that would require ranked-choice voting, or an instant runoff. This would be cheaper — no runoffs held. It would assure that any winning candidate had the support of at least half the voting population. It would give third-party or independent candidates a realistic chance of winning.

In a ranked-choice vote, Jones might well have a chance. Not only Australia but Ireland and many other countries use a ranked-choice, built-in runoff election successfully today, and we could use it to great advantage. ROGER BULLARD Wilson, N.C., Feb. 8, 2012 The Writer Responds Electoral reform should be grounded in core democratic values: majority rule, thoughtful deliberation, high participation, equal access, fair representation and respect for our rights. My proposals are certainly not the only way forward, but we should be wary of regressive ideas. Mr. Liskov’s plan would establish a de facto national primary at the start of the year. I prefer it at the end of a 50-state campaign, thereby leading to more of the candidate debates that Mr. Stevens rightly values, as well as more retail politics that gives us better insight into our future presidents. States should administer the national primary, but parties might choose to have their own primaries and caucuses and try new ways to get people involved. Active political parties are as American as apple pie; let’s just accommodate more than two of them. That explains why I disagree with Mr. Maskin about allowing parties to determine their nominees. But his voting proposal deserves serious consideration, even if hard to win politically. He will have to convince policy makers that it’s sensible to elect a candidate with 10 percent of first choices, trailing two front-runners with 46 percent and 44 percent. That’s easier to justify than approval voting, in which a candidate backed as a first choice by 51 percent or more can lose to a candidate with no first-choice support. Even more revealing for why approval voting is not used in any governmental elections, a voter using it faces an obvious dilemma. Because backing a second candidate counts against one’s first choice, the system devolves into plurality voting when used in meaningfully contested elections. Mr. Brams’s complaints about ranked-choice voting overlook the decades of successful use in nations like Ireland and Australia. No system is perfect, as Mr. Szydlik points out, but ranked-choice voting is better than the only other methods used in single-winner governmental elections — plurality voting and runoffs — and it’s had far more successes in the United States than defeats. I’m optimistic about my entire proposal. By joining with leaders who realize that more competition and participation make our nation stronger, we can win these reforms not only in my children’s lifetime, but mine.
