This is not just because Chic was best known as a disco act, but because it found its party grooves as a conventional band instead of with computers, drum machines, samplers and turntables. Chic remains as potent a hit maker today as it was in its late-70's heyday, when songs like ''Good Times'' and ''Le Freak'' topped the charts and went on to inspire hits, from Queen's ''Another One Bites the Dust'' to the Sugarhill Gang's ''Rapper's Delight.'' In the past year, samples of disco classics written and produced by Mr. Rodgers, a guitarist, and his partner, the bassist Bernard Edwards, have driven two No. 1 hits, ''Gettin' Jiggy Wit It'' by Will Smith (which samples Sister Sledge's ''He's the Greatest Dancer'') and the Notorious B.I.G.'s ''Mo Money Mo Problems'' (which samples Diana Ross's ''I'm Coming Out''). ''There's a whole cultural phenomenon in black music now that's over and lost,'' Mr. Rodgers said of bands like his. ''When I listen to Biggie's  'Mo Money Mo Problems,' I say to myself when an artist starts with a song like that, they're starting with Chic as the band. Tony Thompson, Bernard Edwards, Nile Rodgers, Rob Sabino: that's who's playing in your band. Then you have Diana Ross as your background vocalist, and you have it recorded in a great room on a magical day with Bob Clearmountain as your engineer. That's what you're starting with. If you can't write a hit from that, then you are weak.'' On Friday night Chic is to perform in Manhattan for the first time in 20 years,for two sets at Tramps, with appearances by a few of the many pop stars Mr. Rodgers has written and produced hits for. He has worked with Madonna, David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, Grace Jones, Eric Clapton, the B-52's and dozens more, but the only confirmed guest is Kathie Sledge of Sister Sledge.

''When you go see Heatwave, Con Funk Shun, Rufus, Earth Wind and Fire, or Cameo, all of these bands are completely different and unique and each stands for its own philosophical brand of music and vibe.''  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       So what is Chic's philosophy, then? ''As Bernard used to say, its about a good vibe, it's about a good groove, and it's about good clothes,'' Mr. Rodgers recited. With the death of Mr. Edwards after a retrospective performance in Japan two years ago, many thought that this meant the end of Chic again. (The band broke up in 1983 and reunited six years ago.) But Mr. Rodgers said that with Chic, the musicians, including himself, were no longer essential to the music. He said he vividly recalled his final performance with Mr. Edwards. ''He died on the last night of the show, and being the kind of musician he is, there's no way he's just going to leave the stage or cancel the show,'' he said. ''Midway through the concert, we were doing 'Let's Dance,' and all of a sudden, the bass dropped out at the beginning of the verse. I thought: 'Wow, that's clever. Good job, 'Nard.'

He had passed out, and the roadies had picked him up and placed him behind the stage, and he was sitting there playing. When we took a break in the middle of the show to change clothes, I realized how incredibly sick he was. This is a person I love closer than any family member, a person I know better than anyone who has ever walked this earth, and I knew there was no way he was leaving that stage. That's how we were brought up.'' In the second half of the show, Mr. Bernard slowly made his way to the front of the stage and made it through the show. ''I'll never forget his last speech to the people from Japan,'' Mr. Rodgers said. ''He told them he was a little sick with the Tokyo flu, but he was still here. He told me how much he loved me and how we've been together a long time, and he would do anything for me. Then we went into 'Good Times' and everybody in the house started singing it with us: 10,000 people who didn't even speak English singing 'Good Times' at the top of their lungs. ''At the end of the show, Bernard was crying in my arms, and he just said: 'You know, man, we did it. This music is bigger than us.''' That night, Mr. Bernard was found dead of pneumonia in his hotel room by Mr. Rodgers. The Japanese officials and fans were so supportive after the death, Mr. Rodgers said, that when they asked for Chic to return for 38 dates last year, he couldn't refuse. He invited a musician he admired, Jerry Barnes, to play bass. Though Mr. Rodgers has been busy lately (performing with Puff Daddy, working on a Sony Playstation music game, composing a film soundtrack), for the first time in years his goal is not to make hits.
