Watson ’s 1962 Nobel Prize last week and that he planned to return the medal to Dr. Watson — “the person who deserved it.” The Nobel was awarded to Dr. Watson, now 86, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, for their discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA, which revealed how genetic traits are transmitted through heredity. The buyer, Alisher Usmanov, who lives in Moscow, announced through the London public relations firm Finsbury that he was the anonymous telephone bidder who paid $4.1 million for the gold medal on Thursday at a Christie’s auction, or $4.76 million including the commission. Christie’s, which said the bid was a record for a Nobel sold at auction, confirmed he was the buyer. Forbes lists Mr. Usmanov, 61, as the richest man in Russia , with a net worth of $15.8 billion from steel and mining, telecom and investments. He was an early investor in Facebook and is a part owner of the London soccer club Arsenal. In a statement, Mr. Usmanov indicated that he was distressed that Dr. Watson was selling the medal in order to give much of the proceeds to charity, and he wanted to fulfill Dr. Watson’s charitable impulse without forcing him to give up the physical manifestation of his prize. “In my opinion, a situation in which an outstanding scientist has to sell a medal recognizing his achievements is unacceptable," Mr. Usmanov said. “ James Watson is one of the greatest biologists in the history of mankind, and his award for the discovery of DNA structure must belong to him.” Mr. Usmanov had contacted Dr. Watson before the auction, offering to give him a cash gift to give to charity if he would call off the auction, a spokesman for Dr. Watson, David Kass, said Tuesday. But Dr. Watson wanted to see how it would play out, Mr. Kass said.  Photo        The Nobel Prize medal awarded to James D. Watson in 1962.

He said he had become an outcast in the scientific community after he was quoted in 2007 questioning the intelligence of black people, remarks he apologized for. Mr. Usmanov said his father had died of cancer, so he valued Dr. Watson’s contributions to cancer research. “It is important for me that the money that I spent on this medal will go to supporting scientific research,” he said, “and the medal will stay with the person who deserved it.”   A version of this article appears in print on December 10, 2014, on Page A27 of the New York edition with the headline: Buyer of Nobel Prize Medal Says He Will Return It to Watson.
