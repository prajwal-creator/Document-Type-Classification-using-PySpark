You feel like death on toast. In search of mindless escape, you turn on the television and get back-to-back commercials for cold and flu remedies. Why do the characters in these commercials have such great bedrooms? They all have downy comforters and frilly bedside lamps with cords that they pull when they wake up with the sniffles or chills. They look terrific. Their makeup is perfect. Their hair is squeaky clean. And their pajamas are freshly pressed. One swig of whatever hot liquid medicine is being promoted and the characters jump up and say "Ahhhhhhhhh." Real people with flu say phooey. How bad you look and feel can be a badge of honor in the battle of competitive flu. "They don't have green hair and even greener faces, like I do," Aimee Lee Ball was saying the other day in her husky Blythe Danner voice.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       "People are very competitive about sickness," said Ms. Ball, a writer whose normal body temperature is about 92 degrees. "They always want to know how high my fever is. I know I'm dying but I never have a high enough fever to prove it." John Margolies, an ailing photographer, has been calling a friend who is sick in Los Angeles to compare temperatures. "I have a scoreboard mentality," he said, "and my friend likes to take his temperature a lot, too." Mr. Margolies said his mother gave him her best advice several years ago when he called to report a 103-degree fever. "She said, 'John, just stop taking your temperature!' " For the big picture, people in fever beds have taken to watching the weather channel, which runs maps of influenza outbreaks around the country in yellow (scattered) orange (moderate) and red (widespread). Right now, they will tell you, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are beet red. "Then you get the historical perspective, " said Ed Frantz, a graphics artist. "People call when you're in the midst of a coughing spasm to tell you that this is the most virulent strain since World War II." Older people, he added, want to schmooze about the "Spanish" flu that killed millions right after World War I. "They'll say, 'They don't make flu like that anymore,' " he said. "And you don't have the heart to point out that they didn't have vaccine back then."  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

"You tell them Tylenol and they say: 'That's not enough. You need Extra-Strength Tylenol' or 'Industrial-Strength Tylenol.' " Almost everybody who calls Millicent Safro insists that she take two aspirins with a glass of Coke. Except the interior decorator Mario Buatta, who recommends vitamin C and zinc. But what does he know? He doesn't even have the flu.

She said she's feeling better, "but now my cat's got it and he's sick as a dog." Worse than having the flu, in the minds of some, is being married to the flu. "He's a rotten patient," said a lawyer's wife. "He's sure he's going to die. The complaints: the mattress is lumpy, we need new pillows. That's when I drag out my grandmother's hot whisky sling recipe. It may not cure him but it improves his disposition and sometimes he goes to sleep." Dr. Franklyn B. Springfield, a psychologist, said: "What I do is let the television run and drift in and out of sleep. I'll doze off during 'As the World Turns' and wake up in the middle of 'All My Children.' " The playwright Wendy Wasserstein swears by the curative value of movies made before 1950, particularly those with medical themes. "Yesterday," she said, "I celebrated Richard Widmark's birthday on the American Movie Channel. I watched this really old movie called 'Cobweb.' Richard Widmark was in charge of a clinic." Martha Stewart also recommends watching old movies. She's not sick, but as the life-style queen she is a trove of advice on how to be sick in style. The bed in the Martha Stewart sickroom is made up with the loveliest coziest flannel sheets. The pampered patient is served hot water with a lemon slice floating in a porcelain cup. Beside the bed is a pile of videos, "old movies you really love." Now, she said, "Get into bed and get better."    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
