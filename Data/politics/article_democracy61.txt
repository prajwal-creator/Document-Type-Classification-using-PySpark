It was kidney — not testicular — cancer. An accompanying picture caption also misstated Mr. Laird’s age in some editions. As the article correctly noted, he is 60, not 59. INTERNATIONAL An article last Sunday about challenges facing Europe in 2017 misidentified the party of Geert Wilders, a populist lawmaker in the Netherlands who wants to slash immigration and lead the country out of the European Union. It is the Freedom Party, not the Party for Freedom and Democracy. (The latter is Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s party.) SPORTS The Sports of The Times column on Jan. 22, about the parents of Kevin Turner, a plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit against the N.F.L., contained an outdated value for the settlement in the case. The N.F.L. agreed to pay an unlimited amount of damages, not $765 million. (That was the value of the original settlement, which was rejected by a judge.) And because of an editing error, an accompanying picture caption overstated what was known about Turner’s illness. As the article correctly noted, he received a diagnosis of A.L.S. in 2010 and, after his death in 2016, was found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which has been linked to head trauma; Turner did not have “A.L.S. linked to head trauma.” • An article last Sunday about fans from California who travel to Mexico for Club Tijuana soccer games misidentified Alejandro Serrano’s position with the team. He is the administrative manager, not the general manager. EDUCATION LIFE An article on Page 16 this weekend about Hillsdale, a conservative college in Michigan, misspells the surname of a student who chose it because of its emphasis on classics. She is Tara Ung, not Ang. • An article on Page 20 this weekend about sanctuary campuses for undocumented students refers imprecisely to the institution that said that calls to provide sanctuary were “unacceptable.” It is the University System of Georgia — not the University of Georgia, which is one campus within the system. ARTS & LEISURE A continuation line was omitted from the cover this weekend for an introduction to six essays looking at the final season of “Girls.” The essays begin on Page 18 and continue on Page 19. • An article last Sunday about the new production of “Zoot Suit,” using information from a publicist, misstated the circumstances of the art that will be displayed in the Mark Taper Forum during the show’s new run. The AltaMed Art Collection in Los Angeles is lending the art, not the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach. (The two organizations are co-presenting the exhibit.) TRAVEL An article on Jan. 22, about vacationing on homesteads, misstated the year in which the last homesteader recognized by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service claimed his land. The homesteader, Kenneth Deardorff, claimed the land in 1974, not 1988. The article also misstated the duration of his residence on the land. He lived there from 1974 to 1993, not from 1974 to present day.  • An article last Sunday about the mayor of London’s London referred incorrectly in two instances to Tooting. As noted correctly elsewhere in the article, it is an area within the borough of Wandsworth; it is not itself a borough. BOOK REVIEW A review on Jan. 15 about “Letters to a Young Muslim,” by Omar Saif Ghobash, and “The Atheist Muslim,” by Ali A. Rizvi, misstated the date and context for a quotation by the Virginia statesman Richard Henry Lee. Lee maintained that “true freedom embraces the Mahometan and the Gentoo as well as the Christian religion” in a letter to James Madison in 1784, not “in Congress” in 1776. • A review on Jan. 15 about “How America Lost Its Secrets: Edward Snowden, the Man and the Theft,” by Edward Jay Epstein, misidentified one of the people thanked in the book’s acknowledgments for his “insights, erudition and criticisms” after reading draft chapters. The Ash Carter mentioned there is an editor at Esquire magazine, not the former defense secretary Ashton B. Carter. • A review on Jan. 22 about “Huck Out West,” by Robert Coover, referred erroneously to a plot element in an earlier novel, Jon Clinch’s “Finn,” whose central character is Huck Finn’s father. Though there is a suggestion in one episode that Pap feeds the flesh of his common-law wife to an unsuspecting bootlegger, he himself does not indulge in cannibalism.
