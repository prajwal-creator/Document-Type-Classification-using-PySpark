For the talented Nets, it was one more early season victory as they seek to gain traction in Brooklyn, their new home. For the Kings, it was one more loss in a season of uncertainty: no one seems to know how much longer the team will call this city home or what will become of its charming but outdated arena. The Nets bask in being in a borough that seems to grow more vibrant by the day. The Kings? They still must answer how their arena, which still reads Power Balance Pavilion on its front, got its curious new name. It is actually part of a naming-rights deal with Sleep Train Mattress Centers. But it also seems indicative of the franchise’s being neither here nor there. Back in April 2011, it seemed certain that the Kings would move south to Anaheim. However, the team’s owners, Joe and Gavin Maloof, decided against filing for relocation shortly after Kevin Johnson, the mayor of Sacramento and a former Phoenix Suns point guard, made a last-ditch plea at an owners meeting in New York.

But a tentative deal with the city for a new arena fell apart earlier this year after the Maloofs questioned some of the terms. It is unclear what comes next. Seattle has been one rumored destination, Virginia Beach another. Set against those rumors is an enduring local passion for the team, the city’s only major sports franchise and one that has been here for nearly 30 years. That passion led to recent marketing campaigns — “Here We Build,” “Here We Stay,” “Here We Purple” — that probably helped keep the Kings where they are. But everyone reserves the right to be skeptical about the future, including Kings players. Asked about a new arena, power forward Jason Thompson said he hoped one would be built but added, “You’ve got to see it to believe it.” Some do believe. Earlier this year, a full-length documentary was released chronicling the team’s history in Sacramento, California’s capital. Titled “Small Market, Big Heart,” it opens with a scene of children selling lemonade to try to help raise money to keep the Kings from leaving. It is a cute moment, and an appropriate one, because over the years, when life handed Kings fans lemons, they simply attended games. The Kings have sold out all their home games in 19 of the last 27 seasons; 10 of those seasons were losing ones. These days, attendance is waning some, but the arena, with its accommodating sightlines and dearth of luxury boxes, still offers a throwback experience, to days when games had a more intimate atmosphere. The fans cheer when the local favorite, Jimmer Fredette, checks into the game. They yelled on Wednesday night, too, when the Kings beat the Los Angeles Lakers, 113-97, scoring 40 points in the fourth quarter to put the game away. But even with the heartening victory — the Kings had their highest point total of the season — they remain at the bottom of the Western Conference standings, with a 3-8 record and a roster with veteran role players who are not necessarily inclined to take a back seat to talented, but inconsistent, youngsters.

We’re not one-on-one players.” The Kings shoot 45 percent when they share the ball, Smart noted, but only 30 percent when they go one on one.

You’re young if you only have 80.” Speaking of players in their second, third, fourth and fifth years, Hayes said emphatically: “You know, you’re not young no more. You done seen every play call. You done been to every arena. You done guarded mostly all the players in the league at your position. So the word ‘young’ shouldn’t be thrown around so much. Start taking accountability.” In the Atlanta game, DeMarcus Cousins, a talented but oft-troubled big man, set a Kings single-player season high with seven assists. On the other hand, the game signified his return from a two-game suspension for getting into a heated exchange with the San Antonio Spurs broadcaster Sean Elliott. Elliott had criticized Cousins for his trash talking on the court. Days later, against the Nets, Thompson was heard yelling “Cuz!” to try to get Cousins’s attention as he jabbered with a referee in the middle of a play, not an uncommon occurrence. Yet Cousins finished with 29 points against the Nets and looked like the most gifted player on the floor. So it goes for the Kings, unsure how to play 48 minutes of cohesive basketball, uncertain where their future is. “Obviously you’re going to keep hearing things here and there,” Smart said of all the speculation about where the Kings will end up. “But my job is to keep the team practicing, keep the team focused and keep the team developing into what it’s going to take to have a winning basketball season.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Less diplomatic was Thompson, who said, “It’s my fifth year, man, and all I’ve been hearing is we’re going here, point A to point B, point C, so until someone tells me that I’ve got to move and get out of my house, then. ...” At that point, Thompson stopped himself, but he added, “At the end of the day, you control what you control, and we’re obviously not controlling what we can’t control.” Thompson should know. He was there April 13, 2011, when it appeared the Kings were playing their final home game in Sacramento. “There’s a lot of uncertainty, as we all know,” the Kings broadcaster Grant Napear said on the air that night. Fans were chanting, “Grant and Jerry!” for Napear and his broadcast partner, Jerry Reynolds, and Napear became choked up as he kept speaking. “But the one thing that we do know is the love affair between this team and this city, and tonight we say so long,” he said as he signed off. In the end, it was not goodbye. But the uncertainty lingers, with that bond between the team and the city still in the balance, the losses outweighing the victories, the jokes piling up about the arena’s new name. Kings fans spending sleepless nights in Sacramento are not alone.
