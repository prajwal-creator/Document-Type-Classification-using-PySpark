I am 5 foot 6 and weigh 120 pounds, so I am sure Mr. Starr would not even dream of sentencing me to play contact sports against brutal male high school athletes. However, Mr. Starr might be surprised to find out that I am a twoyear veteran of the perils he describes with such alarm. And he would surely be shocked upon learning that these perilous activities were carried out in near-nudity. Furthermore, I expect he would be crushed to learn that neither I, the one other female member of our waterpolo team nor our male teammates have suffered from any embarrassment and that we do not expect two years of very close contact to affect us negatively when we are grown men and women. On the contrary, I feel my role as an integral part of a boys' team (my school has no girls' water-polo team) has affected me very positively. My teammates and I have learned that women can endure the rigors of a contact sport as well as men, even though, as 14-year-old Eddie Joslin is quoted as saying in Mr. Starr's essay, we're ''not the same.'' No Amazons, we two girls on the team - just fairly athletic, competitive high school students, more interested in the sport than the sex of the participants. We feel we have proved that women who are serious about athletics can compete successfully with males in a contact sport. Mr. Starr may consider little Eddie ''neither obsolete nor troubled, but a social philosopher.'' Bogged in the past, Eddie and Mr. Starr seem to have no idea of what is really happening. Social philosopher, no; social reactionary, yes. KATE B. NOTMAN, Mt. Hermon, Mass., Feb. 15, 1981    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
