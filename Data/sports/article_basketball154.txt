They may not be great conversationalists, but they can offer visitors a sense of history, a lovely environment and intriguing mysteries just waiting to be explored. “We have families come in all the time on the weekends to walk, and if they’re lucky, they get lost here,” said Lisa W. Alpert, referring to Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Although Ms. Alpert, director of development and marketing for the Green-Wood Historic Fund, which operates this 1838 cemetery, stressed that getting lost was “a really great experience,” Green-Wood’s inaugural Family Day on Sunday will be more about finding: architectural elements, stone decorations, mythical creatures and famous “residents,” like Leonard Bernstein and Henry Ward Beecher . “For example, there are several pyramid shapes within the cemetery,” Ms. Alpert said. “That was very popular during the 19th century as an Egyptian symbol of eternity. There is a sphinx on a mausoleum. And then on a lot of the mausoleums there are columns with different capitals.” Activity books will identify some of Green-Wood’s features so that families can create their own walking tours. Unusual details range from the twin cobras and vulture wings in a rather macabre symbol from ancient Egypt, to the cheery crossed bats and glove on the monument for Henry Chadwick (1824-1908), known as the father of baseball. Young visitors can go on scavenger hunts to find carved stone embellishments like the thorny-leafed acanthus, representing life’s difficulties, or decorations like anchors , signifying hope.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   While most activities are geared to ages 5 and older, like a word-search puzzle and a “fun facts” crossword, the handout book has coloring pages for little ones with a character called Captain History, a sort of Superman of the sepulchers. And here’s an unusual art project: designing your own mausoleum.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       All of this illustrates Green-Wood’s evolving role as a cultural institution. “We think of it sometimes as an outdoor museum,” Ms. Alpert said. But however you look at it, this cemetery is full of life. (Sunday, noon to 4 p.m., outside the chapel — events will move indoors if it rains — 25th Street and Fifth Avenue, Green-Wood Heights, 718-210-3080, green-wood.com/toursevents ; $15 for two adults and up to four children; $10 for members. Reservations advised.) LAUREL GRAEBER For Children ‘A-Maze-Ing Water’ (Friday through Thursday) It’s easy to take water for granted, but this new exhibition at the New York Aquarium shows how easily this vital resource can be wasted or polluted. “Water’s Extreme Journey,” the show’s centerpiece, consists of a 1,500-square-foot interactive maze in which children can investigate a model of a watershed and see how contaminants affect the drinking supply; put together puzzles about the water cycle; ride a zipline through pollutants; and discover the diversity of marine life. (Through Sept. 9.) Hours through Sept. 3: daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; to 7 p.m. on weekends and holidays; Surf Avenue and West Eighth Street, Coney Island, Brooklyn, (718) 265-3474, nyaquarium.com . Free with admission: $14.95; $11.95 for 65+; $10.95 for ages 3 to 12; free for under 3; pay what you wish on Fridays after 3 p.m. ABTKids (Saturday) When children watch ballet, often only the dancers are in step with the story. American Ballet Theater’s ABTKids workshops show young people ages 4 to 12 just what all that tiptoeing around is about. This time the agenda is to prepare them to see the afternoon performances of Alexei Ratmansky’s “Firebird” and Frederick Ashton’s “Dream.” And they will get to dance: Teaching artists will divide them into age groups and teach them a brief piece of choreography related to the matinee. At 11 a.m., rehearsal studios, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 419-4231, abt.org/education/workshops.asp ; $25. ‘All-of-a-Kind Family’ Walking Tour (Sunday) This event offers an opportunity not to read a book, exactly, but to stroll through it, following in the footsteps of its characters. Participants will emulate Ella, Henny, Sarah, Charlotte and Gertie, the young daughters in Sydney Taylor’s 1951 classic children’s book about growing up as immigrants on the Lower East Side, “All-of-a-Kind Family.” Stops will include the Seward Park Library and the former site of the Hester Street Market. At 11 a.m., Museum at Eldridge Street, 12 Eldridge Street, between Canal and Division Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0888, eldridgestreet.org ; $20; $15 for students and 65+; $10 for under 18. ‘The Amazing Max and the Box of Interesting Things’ (Saturday and Sunday) Max Darwin, a k a the Amazing Max, may come across like the M.C. at a raucous bar mitzvah party, but he does know his craft. In this hourlong magic performance, which includes lots of audience participation, he performs feats like mind reading, making objects disappear and then reappear in unexpected places, and sending coins raining from various parts of the body. This Saturday he has added an early performance that has been developed especially for children with autism and other disabilities. (Through July 1.) Saturday at 1 (for children with disabilities) and 4:30 p.m.; Sunday at 4:30 p.m.; Manhattan Movement & Arts Center, 248 West 60th Street, (212) 239-6200, theamazingmax.com ; $20 to $54. Animal Tales Extravaganza (Saturday and Sunday) “Avenue Q” may not be appropriate for small children, but “Avenue Zoo” certainly is — and it has one of the same stars. Kate Monster, an “Avenue Q” puppet, has a leading role in “Avenue Zoo,” a musical that’s part of the annual Animal Tales Extravaganza at the Bronx Zoo. In shows at 12:30 and 2:30 p.m., Kate meets exotic animals and learns that they’re more intriguing than scary. Highlights of the extravaganza this weekend also include a rain forest animal parade, making crafts and reading from dozens of wildlife-theme books. (Through June 30.) From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Fordham, (718) 367-1010, bronxzoo.com . Free with admission: $16; $14 for 65+; $12 for ages 3 through 12; free for members and under 3. Parking, $13.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Animation’ (Friday through Thursday) There’s a lot of science in the creation of cartoons, as young visitors will see in this exhibition. Comprising a cartoon museum, a screening room, a studio and several thematic sections, the 6,000-square-foot show, at the New York Hall of Science, allows children to explore animation techniques while learning how math and physics help foster visual effects. Characters and series from Cartoon Network illustrate the principles investigated. (Through Sept. 2.) Museum hours: Fridays, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Mondays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 699-0005, nysci.org .

(The target age range is 6 months to 7 years.) Unlike clubs, these disco gatherings often feature diaper-changing stations, and unlike playgrounds, they usually have snacks and beverages for adults. From noon to 3 p.m., Loews Regency Hotel, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, babylovesdisco.com ; $25; free for children too young to walk. Backstage Tours at ‘The Fantasticks’ (Monday through Wednesday, and Friday through Sunday) The producers of “The Fantasticks” think it’s time to introduce the next generation of theatergoers to their show, the longest-running musical in the world. They have initiated a program for young audiences that will take them behind the scenes after performances, where they can tour the backstage area, meet cast members (Aaron Carter has a starring role), learn how the show is put on and take pictures. And, of course, have their first experience with Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt’s fable about love. Performances are Monday, Tuesday and Friday at 8 p.m.; Wednesday at 2 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Jerry Orbach Theater, Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-7862, fantasticksonbroadway.com . Free with the purchase of tickets: $51.50 to $76.50; $160 for a family four-pack. Tour reservations are required and should be made through the box office. ‘The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical’ (Saturday and Sunday) The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are now onstage in an open-ended run of this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children’s book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it’s rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. At 2 p.m., Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 10 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com ; $34.95 to $59.95. (The most expensive tickets include wearable bear ears and foot-of-the-stage seating.) The Big Draw: DrawNow! (Saturday and Sunday) The landscape at Governors Island will be the setting — and in some cases also the medium — for making art in DrawNow!, a series of projects this weekend and next that are part of the annual Big Draw, a celebration of creativity patterned after the British festival of the same name. Sponsored by the Drawing Center in SoHo, the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and the River to River Festival, DrawNow! invites families to participate in site-specific projects run by artists. On Saturday, J Carpenter will lead “Stretch It Out!,” in which visitors will wrap bungee cords and trail-marking tape around trees, bushes and chain-link fences to turn the topography itself into a drawing. On Sunday, Valérie Hallier and Andy Deck will operate “Drawing Circle,” a workshop to explore and make panoramic views of Fort Jay, the former Army post whose roots date back to the Revolutionary War. At 2 p.m., Governors Island, drawingcenter.org ; rivertorivernyc.com ; free, rain or shine. Carroll Park Kids Concert Series (Saturday) Summer, parks and children all go together, and some Brooklyn organizers have added another harmonious element: music. This series returns for the season with an opening concert featuring Karen K & the Jitterbugs, who will perform with students and teachers from Public School 58. (Each concert will be partly a fund-raiser for a school.) The band, which released its first album, “Pancakes for Dinner,” last year, travels a spectrum from old-style pop to country rock. And speaking of pancakes, food will be on sale. (Monthly through Sept. 29.) At 4 p.m. (food and activities from 2 to 5 p.m.), Carroll Park, President and Smith Streets, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, carrollparkbrooklyn.org/concerts ; free. Children’s Museum of the Arts Free Art Island Outpost (Saturday and Sunday) This island fun doesn’t require a flight to distant shores. The Children’s Museum of the Arts has started another summer of weekend workshops on Governors Island, which explore a variety of crafts and materials. Each weekend includes organic art making, using resources children find on the island itself, in Building 14; and media lab arts, with activities like filmmaking, sound-music production, animation and puppetry, in Building 11. (More workshops will also take place on Saturday and Sunday in the museum itself; details are on the Web site.) From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Nolan Park, Governors Island, (212) 274-0986, cmany.org , govisland.com ; free. Family Tour of Rockefeller Center (Saturday) Many New Yorkers probably think they know Rockefeller Center, but this walking tour from the Municipal Art Society, part of the Family Time series for parents with children 8 through 14, will show its more hidden side, including underground passages and little-known treasures. The tour, led by the art historian Sylvia Laudien-Meo, will also offer sketching opportunities, with investigations of murals and sculptures celebrating modern achievements. At 11 a.m., (212) 935-2075, mas.org/tours ; $20; $15 for Municipal Art Society members. Reservations required.

It does so with a winning score and inventive comedy, as well as an acknowledgment of the unfunny aspects of its young heroine’s situation. (Through July 1.) Saturday at 3 p.m.; Sunday at 1 p.m.; Manhattan Movement & Arts Center, 248 West 60th Street, (212) 239-6200, frecklefacethemusical.com ; $45 and $85.

That’s what Catherine Fowles and Robert Gilbert are attempting in Off Broadway Family Theater’s first production, le Clanché du Rand’s adaptation of C.S. Lewis’s classic novel. (The run is open-ended.) Saturdays at 11 a.m., St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, narniaoffbroadway.com ; $35. ‘Little Miss Muffet’s Monster-Sitting Service’ (Friday through Sunday) This Little Miss Muffet, Molly, a descendant of the original, is certainly a lot braver: not only does she not fear spiders, but she’s also willing to go into business with the very one that sat down beside her ancestor. In this production from the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater in Central Park, by Doug Strich and Emily Fellner, Molly and Al, the spider, start a baby-sitting service for infant monsters just as a huge winter storm is heading their way.

Her projects pop up regularly for public television fans watching shows like “Sesame Street” and “Curious George.” At this concert her young fans can directly experience her music, which includes interactive fun like counting odd numbers, singing the praises of fruits and vegetables and doing the Macaroni Dance. At 6 p.m., Mount Vernon Hotel Museum & Garden, 421 East 61st Street, Manhattan, (212) 838-6878, mvhm.org ; monkeymonkeymusic.com ; $20; $5 for under 12; free for members.

The interactive show, inspired by the Chinese epic “The Journey to the West,” recreates many of the Monkey’s adventures, like fighting the Bull Demon at a station that resembles a video game. Much of the fun teaches Chinese values: cooperation, perseverance, bravery and self-sacrifice. (Through May.) Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; to 7 p.m. on Saturdays. Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1223, cmom.org . Free with admission: $11; $7 for 65+; free for under 1 and members.

Roosevelt Park, Chrystie and Stanton Streets, Lower East Side, stevenash.org/showdown ; free. ‘Pageant Princess, the Musical’ (Saturday) The three girls in this show aren’t competing for the Miss America crown; they’re way too little.

(John Gregor wrote the score and some of the lyrics.) (Through July 1; the production will move to another theater on July 7.)

For Sarazad, the protagonist of E. J. C. Calvert’s children’s play, the circumstances are different: She’s only 9, and her tales work to improve the mood of the irascible Monster-King she meets in Storyland. But both heroines learn the redemptive power of their own imaginations; for Sarazad, her art can help her triumph over school bullies. (Through July 15.) At 1 and 4 p.m., Canal Park Playhouse, 508 Canal Street, near Greenwich Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, canalparkplayhouse.com ; $18.
