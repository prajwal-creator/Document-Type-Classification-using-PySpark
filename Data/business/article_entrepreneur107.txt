This is about ''N.M.B. v. S.L.B.,'' a divorce case. The initials belong to the husband who filed it and his soon-to-be ex-wife. It turns out that the husband is one of President Bush's younger brothers, NEIL M. BUSH, who was a director of the Silverado Banking, Savings & Loan Association of Colorado when it failed in the late 1980's. Now a software entrepreneur, he cited ''discord or conflict of personalities'' as the reason he wanted a divorce from his wife, SHARON L. BUSH. Court papers filed in Houston say they were married in 1980 and separated in July. The Houston Chronicle said that Mr. Bush had agreed to take the case to alternative dispute resolution to decide custody of the couple's two younger daughters, PIERCE and ASHLEY. Their oldest child, LAUREN, a model who is 18, is not mentioned in the divorce papers. Mr. Bush's lawyer, RICHARD FLOWERS JR., did not return a telephone call yesterday. . . . Been There, Trying Again GERALDO RIVERA is the marrying kind. Four divorces did not stop him from proposing to ERICA LEVY, a producer at MSNBC, his spokeswoman said. He asked -- and she said yes -- on a flight to Scotland. ''He wanted to wait until they got there, but he couldn't,'' his spokeswoman said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A.J. DISCALA proposed to JAMIE-LYNN SIGLER, who plays Meadow on ''The Sopranos,'' during a Mexican cruise. People magazine said -- and Ms. Sigler's spokeswoman confirmed -- that Mr. Discala waited for her to come out of the shower, then recited a poem and asked the big question.

Mr. Sheirer, who was the commissioner of the city's Office of Emergency Management when the jetliners smashed into the twin towers a year ago, has been named an honorary C.B.E., or commander of the British Empire. His boss then and now, RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI, received an honorary knighthood -- which made him a K.B.E., or Knight of the British Empire -- in February. The title for Mr. Sheirer puts him at the same level as BERNARD B. KERIK, the former police commissioner, and THOMAS VON ESSEN, the former fire commissioner, who became C.B.E.'s when Mr. Giuliani was knighted. Mr. Sheirer, who spent more than 30 years in the Fire and Police Departments before moving to the emergency management agency, is a senior vice president with Mr. Giuliani's consulting firm. For work in the aftermath of Sept. 11, the British consulate announced the appointments of the REV. ANDREW CRAIG MEAD, the rector of St. Thomas Church, and BRADFORD EMMET BILLET, deputy commissioner of the city's Commission for the United Nations, to the Order of the British Empire, or O.B.E. Does It Stop at Dollywood? OLIVER NORTH, the gung-ho former marine turned talk radio host who was at the center of the Iran-contra scandal in the 1980's, is going coast to coast on a bus whose most recent occupant was DOLLY PARTON.

Make that, will be driven through. The bus came with two drivers -- ''a day driver and a night driver,'' said DUANE WARD, who schedules Mr. North's speeches. Mr. Ward said that the bus had been rented from a Memphis company whose customers have included BRITNEY SPEARS and CHER. Science of the Chic ADAM BLY is moving himself and his magazine to New York. The magazine, Seed, began in Montreal and is not for the Martha Stewart set. He describes it as ''a fusion of the New Yorker and Scientific American, or Vanity Fair and Discovery.'' The other night, he showed that he had figured out how to get attention in New York: give a big, noisy party with a D.J., in this case at the Eyebeam Atelier, on West 21st Street. ''It's getting loud in here, eh?'' Mr. Bly said, moving away from a speaker. Why New York? ''If you're going to create a new scene in science, there's no better place,'' he said. He looked around the room and noted the absence of plastic pocket-protectors and glasses held together with tape. What he saw were cowboy hats and bare midriffs. ''This is the new image of science,'' he said. No lab coats allowed.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
