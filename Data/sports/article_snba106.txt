What were the circumstances then? That situation occurred in 1941 and was a bit different because Williams, who already had the batting title locked up by more than 40 percentage points, was shooting to preserve a .400 batting average, and the only injury he faced would have been to his pride. After Williams went 1 for 4 on the next-to-last day of the season, dropping his average from .4009 to .39955, Manager Joe Cronin of the Red Sox offered to bench him for the season-ending doubleheader in Philadelphia so Williams could finish with an average that would be acceptable as .400 after being rounded off. But Williams rejected the offer, and in five times up in the opening game he belted his 37th homer of the season and three singles in a 12-11 victory over the Athletics, improving his average to .4031. Still unwilling to call it a season, Williams rapped a single and double in three times up before the second game was called because of darkness after seven innings with the Athletics winning, 7-1. The 6 for 8 closing-day performance gave Williams a final average of .4057, and that .406 mark of 45 years ago represents the last time a major leaguer batted .400 in a season. QUESTION: Since Fenway Park became the home of the Red Sox in Boston, what is the Yankees' won-lost record there and have they ever swept a season series there? How about the Red Sox in Yankee Stadium? Since Fenway opened in 1912, the Yankees hold a 377-361 edge in games played there, including the 1978 playoff victory that won the American League East title for New York. Only once, in 1980 when they were 7-0, have the Yankees swept the Red Sox at Fenway, although they didn't do badly there this year with a 6-1 record. No Yankee team has ever failed to win a game at Fenway, nor has any Red Sox team finished a season at Yankee Stadium without winning at least once.

During those two years, the teams met 16 times at Shea Stadium, where the Red Sox had the edge, 10-6. QUESTION: On a kickoff by Team A, the kick returner for Team B misplays the descending football and drops it on the 1-yard line. Before he can pick it up, the first Team A player downfield dives for the ball and knocks it not only into the end zone, but also out of the end zone. Which team gets the ball and where is it put in play?  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Since neither player ever had possession of the ball, the play amounts to nothing more than it would have if the kickoff had sailed through the end zone untouched by any player. So the ruling would be a touchback, giving Team B possession at its 20-yard line. Had the receiver caught the ball, then fumbled it, instead of muffing it, he would have been deemed in possession and what followed would have been ruled a 2-point safety for Team A. QUESTION: Who's the backup quarterback to Marc Wilson and Jim Plunkett of the Los Angeles Raiders and has he ever gotten into a game?

Hilger has not appeared in any games this season, but he was in four last year, rushing 3 times for 8 yards and completing 4 passes in 13 attempts for 54 yards and one touchdown. The score, which came on a 2-yard pass in the fourth quarter to Todd Christensen in a 35-20 victory over New England, marked the first time a rookie Raider quarterback had passed for a touchdown since Mike Rae in 1976. In a real pinch, the man with a leg up on the Raiders' quarterback job is their All-Pro punter, Ray Guy. His 13-year kicking career has taken a couple of unexpected bounces resulting in 2 pass completions in 3 attempts for 54 yards with 1 interception, and 9 running attempts for 43 yards, with one 12-yard sack. QUESTION: Why do horseplayers and breeders concentrate on following the male ancestors of race horses? Aren't the female bloodlines just as important for such characteristics as speed and endurance? Both male and female lines are equally important for breeders. Where bettors are concerned, what's important is what's most familiar, and the average fan is more likely to recognize a grandsire (male) than a grandam (female) because stallions will sire far more horses than a dam will produce.
