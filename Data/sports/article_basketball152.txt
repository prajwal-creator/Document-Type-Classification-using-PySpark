But young detectives gathering on the Lower East Side on Sunday will go strictly low-tech: clipboards, pencils, flashlights, binoculars. Armed with only curiosity, they won’t be seeking the tracks of a criminal but the traces of a long-ago community. These are preservation detectives, participating in the program of the same name at the Museum at Eldridge Street. This family series evokes the atmosphere of a whodunit to introduce children 5 to 10 to the museum’s core: the 1887 Eldridge Street Synagogue , one of the first houses of worship that Eastern European Jews built in America. “It’s like getting to know someone,” said Judy Greenspan, the museum’s education director. “There are so many layers. The more you look at it, the more layers there are.” “Preservation Detectives,” which now runs once a month, encourages children to look by giving them clues to the building’s and neighborhood’s history , often in the form of a scavenger hunt. For this Sunday’s edition, “A World of Shapes and Colors,” they will receive a list that includes, for example, photographs of three hard-to-find Stars of David. They will also be asked to identify the real marble slabs in what is mostly a faux-marble interior. Nonreaders will get a sheet of shapes to seek. Each program ends with an art activity, in this case making a collage using some of the forms unveiled.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   “We’ve never done this particular scavenger hunt before,” Ms. Greenspan said. But like the others, it isn’t an end in itself. “Preservation Detectives” leads children into discussions of the meaning behind their discoveries and the emotions of the 19th-century congregants.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       “What was their intent when they built this synagogue?” Ms. Greenspan said. “Why did they want a place that contrasted so much with everyday life? Even in a scavenger hunt that story emerges.” While the setting is far from a crime scene, it does involve telltale footprints. The building’s restoration , completed in 2007, left the sanctuary’s pine floors untouched. “They wanted to leave the marks that thousands of feet had made,” Ms. Greenspan said. “Orthodox men rock back and forth when they pray, and that rocking created grooves in the floor. You can step very comfortably into what are literally the footprints of immigrants.” (At 11 a.m., 12 Eldridge Street, between Canal and Division Streets, 212-219-0302, eldridgestreet.org ; $15 per family. Space is limited; advance purchase recommended at preservationdetectivesaugust12-eorg.eventbrite.com .) LAUREL GRAEBER For Children  ‘A-Maze-Ing Water’ (Friday through Thursday) It’s easy to take water for granted, but this new exhibition at the New York Aquarium shows how easily this vital resource can be wasted or polluted. “Water’s Extreme Journey,” the show’s centerpiece, consists of a 1,500-square-foot interactive maze in which children can investigate a model of a watershed and see how contaminants affect the drinking supply; put together puzzles about the water cycle; ride a zipline through pollutants; and discover the diversity of marine life. (Through Sept. 9.) Hours through Sept. 3: daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; to 7 p.m. on weekends and holidays; Surf Avenue and West Eighth Street, Coney Island, Brooklyn, (718) 265-3474, nyaquarium.com .

(Through Sept. 16.)

Comprising a cartoon museum, a screening room, a studio and several thematic sections, the 6,000-square-foot show, at the New York Hall of Science, allows children to explore animation techniques while learning how math and physics help foster visual effects.

Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show, for ages 3 to 10, also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. From 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8 p.m. on Thursdays; 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org .

Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Art Forms: 75 Years of Arts Education’ (Friday through Monday, and Wednesday and Thursday) Few children’s museums have permanent collections, and even fewer have holdings like those of the Children’s Museum of the Arts: young people’s own creations, dating back to the 1930s. This new exhibition showcases 30 examples of art made in previous eras by students of noted educators like Leon Bibel, a painter in the Works Progress Administration; the theorist Henry Schaefer-Simmern; and Sona Kludjian, who taught at a performing and visual arts school in Harlem. Their pupils’ art is shown along with works by contemporary students in 18 public schools who have participated in the museum’s programs. (Through Sept. 30.)

They have initiated a program for young audiences that will take them behind the scenes after performances, where they can tour the backstage area, meet cast members (Aaron Carter and John Davidson are both in it), learn how the show is put on and take pictures. And, of course, have their first experience with Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt’s fable about love. Performances are Monday, Tuesday and Friday at 8 p.m.; Wednesday at 2 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Jerry Orbach Theater, Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-7862, fantasticksonbroadway.com .

In Family Matters, the Musical’ (Saturday and Sunday) The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are now onstage in an open-ended run of this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children’s book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it’s rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday at 11 a.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m.; Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 10 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com ; $34.95 to $59.95.

From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Nolan Park, Governors Island, (212) 274-0986, cmany.org , govisland.com ; free. ‘A Clearing in the Forest’: Storytelling (Sunday) Boys and girls are forever wandering into enchanted forests in fairy tales, but they don’t expect to stumble onto one just off the bustling streets of Manhattan. Thanks to the Peter Jay Sharp Foundation and the Central Park Conservancy, they have something that comes close. Called the Peter Jay Sharp Children’s Glade, it has a natural amphitheater that is the site of “A Clearing in the Forest,” a series of arts programs every other Sunday through Oct. 7.

Field Station: Dinosaurs (Friday through Thursday) It’s not unusual to go see giants in the Meadowlands, but those attracting visitors to that area of New Jersey this summer don’t wear helmets or play football. Field Station: Dinosaurs is a 20-acre park filled with more than 30 animatronic prehistoric creatures, including a Tyrannosaurus rex, a stegosaurus and a 90-foot-long argentinosaurus. The dinosaurs move when approached, and the three-quarter-mile trail also offers other paleontology exhibits and a mock fossil dig site.

Free for 2 and under. ‘Flying Monsters 3D’ (Friday through Thursday) This sounds like the perfect contemporary scary film, except that these monsters didn’t come from a folk tale or a horror writer’s imagination: They were living, breathing realities millions of years ago. Written and narrated by David Attenborough, this new giant-screen 3-D film from National Geographic explores the world of pterosaurs: flying reptiles like the quetzalcoatlus, which was the size of a jumbo jetliner, and the tapejara, which had a sailboat-shaped head. Scientists will discuss their fossils, while the 3-D re-creations swoop at you from the screen.

Get Up & Go! Family Adventure Race (Sunday) Children sometimes tend to run away from their parents, but in this new fitness competition from the City Parks Foundation, they’ll run with them. Children in two age categories — 8 through 10, and 11 through 13 — and a parent or guardian will run a course that includes 12 activity stations. Each team (one adult and up to two children) must complete a station’s task — basketball free throws, hurdles and bench push-ups among them — before advancing to the next stop. The top three finishers in each group will receive awards, and everyone completing the course will get a T-shirt, a certificate and, of course, a great workout.

Gabriel Willow, a naturalist and storyteller, narrates the adventure, conducted via New York Water Taxi. This Sunday’s destination: the Brother Islands. From 7 to 8:30 p.m., Pier 17, South Street Seaport, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 742-1969, nywatertaxi.com , nycaudubon.org ; $35; $25 for ages 3 through 12; free for under 3. ‘A Voyage Through Jewish History’ (Sunday through Thursday) This journey involves not just miles, but years. In this new permanent interactive exhibition at the Jewish Children’s Museum, young visitors can travel from Abraham and Sarah’s tent to the Western Wall in contemporary Jerusalem and beyond. Activities along the way include giving water to Rebecca’s camels, playing the strings on David’s harp (a high-tech version with beams of light that emit sounds when struck) and taking part in the exodus from Egypt. Sundays through Aug. 26, the museum is also offering “Blow Your Horn!,” workshops in making shofars for the Jewish New Year. From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (until 6 p.m. on Sundays); 792 Eastern Parkway, at Kingston Avenue, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 907-8833, jcm.museum ; $10; free for under 2. Wave Hill (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday) This public garden in the Bronx offers many ways for young visitors to commune with nature, including yoga, art and storytelling. On Friday from 10 to 11 a.m., “Yoga Together” invites parents and children ages 2 to 5 to practice poses like jumping frog and downward-facing dog in the midst of the grounds, weather permitting. (Take mats if possible; registration starts at 9:30 a.m. at the Perkins Visitor Center.) On Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the Ecology Building, the Family Art Project, “Flutter With the Butterflies,” will invite children to sketch the butterflies on the grounds and make butterfly hats to do some soaring of their own. On Sunday only, at 12:30 p.m., the naturalist Paul Keim will lead families with children 6 and older on a butterfly walk; participants are to meet at the Perkins center. Then on Tuesday at 11 a.m., children can enjoy garden and nature tales in a shady spot on the grounds, meeting first at the Perkins center. Independence Avenue and West 249th Street, Riverdale, the Bronx, (718) 549-3200, wavehill.org . Yoga: $23 for one adult and one child; $15 for members; $5 for each additional child. All other programs are free with garden admission: $8; $4 for students and 65+; $2 for children over 6; free for members; free to all on Saturday until noon and all day on Tuesday. ‘The White Doe, or the Piteous Trybulations of the Sufferyng Countess Jenovefa’ (Friday, Saturday, Wednesday and Thursday) Vit Horejs, the master puppeteer behind the Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theater, is back with his troupe and the 30 century-old marionettes he uses to bring a variety of Old World stories to life. This 17th-century tale, recommended for children over 6, involves an Iago-like figure, Golo, who convinces his master, Count Sylkfrid, that Sylkfrid’s wife, Jenovefa, has been unfaithful. The story ends happily, but only after a ghost and a white doe have played roles in undoing Golo’s betrayal. The company members will sing Czech folk songs between the acts of this 70-minute show. (Through Aug. 18.) At 8 p.m., with an additional 5 p.m. show on Saturdays, Bohemian National Hall, 321 East 73rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, czechmarionettes.org ; $18; $12 for under 12 and 65+. The Wiggles’ Celebration Tour (Sunday) These concerts have a farewell theme — these will be the last performances by three of the four longstanding members of the Wiggles, one of the biggest pop bands for preschoolers — but it’s hard to be sad when these guys are onstage singing and dancing. And in 2013 the group will go on when three new band mates, including the first female Wiggle, take up the torch. In the meantime these shows will show how good the members are at playing and wiggling, and at making children wiggle too. (Also Aug. 19 in Westbury, N.Y.) At 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m., Izod Center, 50 Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J.; $15.50 to $80.50. Tickets: (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com . ‘The Wise Puppets of Chelm’ (Sunday) Can you imagine puppets dancing the hora? Don’t be surprised if it happens at the Center for Jewish History on Sunday, when Jacob Stein and the Bakery Band Puppets present this show. Before it begins children will make puppets of their own to use during the performance. They will join the troupe’s fuzzy, friendly, oversize puppets in an exploration of Jewish culture, past and present, accompanied by original and traditional music. At 11:30 a.m. (doors open at 11), 15 West 16th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 868-4444, cjh.org/summersundays ; $5; free for ages 2 and under. Word for Word Kids (Saturday) The words come from books, stories, music and occasionally magic, which are celebrated in this summer series on Saturdays at noon in the Bryant Park Reading Room. This week’s installment features Astrograss, a Brooklyn band offering bluegrass, along with folk music, comedy, singalongs and dance contests. Those seeking more entertainment can head over to the park’s Carrousel at 1 p.m. for Le Carrousel Kids, a storytelling session with the characters Flaubert Frog & Friends. (Through Aug. 18.) Avenue of the Americas, at 40th Street, (212) 768-4242, bryantpark.org ; free. (Rain location for Word for Word Kids is the Children’s Center at the New York Public Library.)
