Loredana Giangrande's aerobics class at the high school has helped her lose six pounds. "It relaxes me," she said of the class, which is held in a large room with mirrored walls and a sound system for music that accompanies the exercises. "I get migraine headaches, but when I'm in aerobics class, they go away." Individualized fitness programs have found their way into the classroom, according to Dr. Judy Young, executive director of the National Association of Sports and Physical Education. "The trend in physical education has moved to more individualized activities," said Dr. Young. "Kids are competing against themselves, not other students." The result is a physical education curriculum that often resembles a health-club program. "Instead of going to Jack LaLanne and paying for fitness, we're meeting the students' needs and making physical education more attractive to them," says David B. Marsh, director of health, physical education and athletics for schools in Ridgewood, N.J. There, as in Hackensack, high school students above the freshman year write their own exercise programs and choose physical education on an elective basis.

Constance Trifletti, a physical education teacher, converted the school's old cafeteria into a fitness center, complete with stationary bikes, rowing machines and other exercise equipment, donated by the football and baseball teams. In addition, each student has a personalized fitness routine and is required to keep a daily exercise journal.

Some 70 percent of girls and 40 percent of boys ages 6 to 12 do not have enough muscle strength to do more than one pull-up. In addition, while states like California, Florida and North Carolina have created personalized student fitness programs, others, including South Dakota, Wyoming, Michigan, Colorado and Maine, have no requirements at all for elementary and secondary students. To deal with such problems, Congress recently passed the National Physical Education resolution, urging state and local education officials to require all students from kindergarten through 12th grade to have a daily program. "It is more socially acceptable now than it was 10 years ago to observe a healthy life-style," Dr. Young said. William Kyle, coordinator of secondary physical education for the Montgomery County Public School System in Maryland, adds: "Whether it's weight training or a team sport, it's important that the kids are doing something physical."
