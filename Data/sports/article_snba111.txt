Among them is the ticket price of $20, and he leaves his readers with the incorrect impression that all seats are so priced. In fact, as we indicated in the Yale ticket brochure that he received, there will be tickets available at both $10 and $15, which were the prices for tickets to the game in 1981 and 1982, respectively. I hope this information will encourage Mr. Holahan to reconsider his decision not to attend the game. The occasion is doubly inviting: The 100th engagement of this football rivalry symbolizes the determined preservation of amateur athletics in America, and it is possibly the only major sporting event available today at yesterday's prices.
