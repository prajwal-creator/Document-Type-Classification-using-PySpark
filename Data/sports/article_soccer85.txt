The World Cup draw in Cape Town on Friday was stigmatized by the shrug of indifference by which the sport’s overlords have implied that if a player gets away with cheating on the pitch, there is nothing officialdom can do about it. Adding irony to insult, FIFA’s president, Sepp Blatter, pronounced that Ireland might be afforded “moral compensation” for losing out in World Cup qualification to the blatant handball from Thierry Henry to set up the winning goal for France. But on Saturday, the players of Ascoli, a team struggling at the foot of the Italian second division, demonstrated fair play to a man. It led at 14 minutes, after a controversial goal that came directly from an injured opponent, Carlos Valdez of Reggina, trying to boot the ball out of play to receive treatment. Ascoli intercepted his clearance and scored its goal. In the heat of Reggina’s protests, its defender Andrea Costa was red-carded by the referee. But when calm was restored, Ascoli’s players did the right and proper thing. They stood aside and allowed Reggina to equalize, unopposed.

It may not get it because Ascoli Piceno is a mere Serie B club, off the radar of the headliners like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and, well, Thierry Henry.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       For what it’s worth, this column salutes the team. Fair Play in soccer, however, might yet have repercussions for Ascoli. The equalizer led to a 3-1 home defeat, and the points lost Saturday could be critical when the relegation places are settled at the end. Way above Ascoli’s pretensions, the Serie A title in Italy is warming toward a three-way contest. AC Milan, after its slow start under a new coach, Leonardo, won 3-0 on Saturday against Sampdoria — and we should take with a pinch of salt the obsequious suggestion by the club’s vice president, Adriano Galliani, that the praise should go to his boss, and Italy’s boss, Silvio Berlusconi. “We were a great Milan,” Galliani said after the game. “Berlusconi came to the dressing room at halftime. He told the players to keep the ball, and that’s what they did. We never showed Samp the ball.” But maybe the fact that Milan had killed off the game with goals from Marco Barriello, Clarence Seedorf and Alexandre Pato in the first 23 minutes had something to do with the victory. And there is no team in Italy more experienced or more adept at playing keep-ball than Milan. The victory takes it to within four points of the league leader, its neighbor Inter, which lost a fractious encounter against third-placed Juventus, 2-1, in Turin. The features of that match were an opening goal for Juve that was over the line off a defender; Inter’s coach, José Mourinho, getting himself ordered to the stand for his petulance on the touchline; and an equalizer from Samuel Eto’o. And then the pièce de résistance in the game winner. Claudio Marchiso, at 23, is young by Italian standards and showed wonderful composure and marvelous footwork just to stay on his feet as he danced through the Inter defense to steal the vital goal at 58 minutes. Serie A, seemingly the preserve of Inter ever since the 2006 match-fixing scandal demoted Juventus to Serie B and knocked points off AC Milan, is suddenly and refreshingly a real competition again.

He not only ducked the postgame news conference, but his captain, Javier Zanetti, told reporters, “He didn’t even speak to us.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   From Italy to England, where the Premiership also was revitalized by the top team’s losing. Chelsea’s progress under the former Milan trainer Carlo Ancelotti seemed imperious as it overpowered Arsenal a week ago and had also beaten Manchester United. But Chelsea fell at Manchester City, the new force empowered by money from the Abu Dhabi government. City’s squad was a match for Chelsea in a tense, physical encounter, and its 2-1 triumph came despite Chelsea’s taking a fortuitous early lead through an own-goal off Emmanuel Adebayor. The big Togo international knew nothing about the mishap as his goalie, Shay Given, pushed the ball into his back, but he was motivated to score at the other end, and then Carlos Tévez struck what turned out to be the decisive second goal. City won because it matched Chelsea’s outstanding quality, its redoubtable team spirit. And it won because Given, the Irish keeper still traumatized by that dastardly Henry trick in Paris last month, brought off the first penalty save anyone has made against Frank Lampard in three seasons. So, in Italy and in England, the leagues opened up a little at the top this weekend. In Spain, not so. Real Madrid came from a goal down to overpower Almería, 4-2, at the Bernabéu stadium on Saturday evening, but a couple of hours later the champion and still the league leader, Barcelona, showed even finer class in outplaying Deportivo la Coruna, 3-1, in Coruna’s fortress, the Riazor. Those two games demonstrated something about the best player in the world in 2009. Cristiano Ronaldo, last year’s leading man and this year’s €100 million, or $148 million, purchase by Real Madrid, is being eclipsed at the moment by Barça’s Messi. Messi has just been awarded France Football’s Ballon d’Or as the top player in the sport. Journalists from 93 countries voted him overwhelmingly their No. 1, and he is certain to win all the other global awards as the season of accolades begins. Ronaldo, just back from ankle injury, had a mixed match Saturday. He set up a goal, he scored one and he had a penalty saved. He received a yellow card for baring his chest to celebrate his goal, then was sent off for a rash kick at a defender who had cuffed the back of his head. Messi was on the pitch the whole 90 minutes. He scored twice — through marvelously quick movement of foot for the first goal and then with a leaping header. But Messi was a whole lot more, defending when he felt the need, constantly changing position, the star who sublimates himself to the team. And keeps his shirt on. Messi turned a difficult and fascinating game. “That,” said Dani Alves, his Barcelona teammate, “is why he’s the Ballon d’Or.”   A version of this article appears in print on December 7, 2009, in The International Herald Tribune.
