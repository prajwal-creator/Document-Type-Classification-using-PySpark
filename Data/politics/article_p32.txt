Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee has concluded. Read our full conversation below, or see the key moments or read a transcript of the hearing .  JUNE 8, 2017               Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 9:49 AM ET   Good morning everyone, and welcome to a blockbuster day of testimony in Congress by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who was abruptly fired by President Trump last month. Comey will be testifying this morning before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence about his personal interactions with the president and discussions about the government’s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.  I’m Julie Hirschfeld Davis, a White House correspondent at the Times, and I am joined here today by my colleagues who have been covering this saga day in and day out: Michael Schmidt, Matt Apuzzo, Charlie Savage, Matthew Rosenberg, Adam Goldman and Rebecca Ruiz. We will be providing real-time analysis and context for Comey’s comments as we all digest what are sure to be important revelations in the continuing probe into whether the president’s advisers colluded with Russia to sway the election, and what Trump may have said or done to try to influence that investigation.  Comey has already made his prepared statement public, and you can read all about what he plans to say here:     Photo         Comey Says Trump Pressured Him to ‘Lift the Cloud’ of Inquiry   Planned testimony by the former F.B.I. director reveals, in dramatic detail, the back story to Mr. Comey’s firing last month.    The New York Times     So the real action today will be in the question-and-answer sessions between Comey and the senators on the committee, who have now had ample time to formulate their lines of inquiry and drill down on specifics. And we will be watching for real-time reaction from the president, whose staff has made sure he has a busy schedule today, but who rarely resists the chance to weigh in  via Twitter on news developments that pertain to him personally.        Matt Apuzzo  Washington Reporter    June 8, 9:55 AM ET   Comey has some home-field advantage here. He has performed well in the Senate in the past, and before the Intelligence Committee in particular. Some Senate staffers used to privately call him “Senator Comey” because he was so at ease in the hot seat.        Matt Apuzzo  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:02 AM ET   One reason Comey asked that his opening testimony be released a day early was to give senators and reporters time to digest the long and nuanced timeline of his interactions with Trump. Had Comey dropped that all today, the Senate questions would have been clunkier and the public’s understanding would have been murkier.        Matt Apuzzo  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:02 AM ET   News photographers are taking pictures of Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who is taking pictures of the crowded room. There’s lot going on there.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:07 AM ET   “Today is your opportunity to set the record straight,” Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, tells Comey. And with that, the hearing is underway.           Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:10 AM ET   Senator Burr’s first question for Comey: Did the president’s behavior affect how you handled the Russia investigation?        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:11 AM ET   Matt, I propose that asking his opening testimony to be released early had further strategic advantages for the Comey camp. It dominated the news coverage for the last 20 hours, drowning out any attempt by the Trump camp to soften him up. And it locked in the Trump White House’s decision not to assert executive privilege to try to derail the testimony, meaning Trump couldn’t change his mind.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:12 AM ET   The committee’s chairman, Richard Burr, opened the hearing reminding everyone that this is part of the Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 and noted that there have been a variety of allegations swirling in the press in recent weeks. “Today’s your opportunity to set the record straight.”  “I very much appreciate your candor,” Burr tells Comey, and says the public needs to hear his side, “just as they need to hear the president’s description of events.”        Matt Apuzzo  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:13 AM ET   I agree with Charlie on the timing of Comey’s testimony release. It was a savvy move all around.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:14 AM ET   What does everyone think: Will we hear directly from Trump in an official setting?        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:14 AM ET   Good question, Julie. To be a fly on the wall of the White House dining room this morning. It will be interesting to see how the president’s legal team, watching the testimony alongside him, might influence or modulate his reaction to what Comey says today.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:17 AM ET   Senator Mark Warner of Virginia — who is the ranking Democrat on the committee — calls Comey’s firing “shocking,” and suggests the fact that he was leading an investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties with Russia “might explain why you’re sitting now as a private citizen.”  He poses a key question of today’s proceedings: whether, as Comey has indicated in his account of events, Trump was engaged in an effort “to influence or at least co-opt the director of the F.B.I.”        Matt Apuzzo  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:18 AM ET   Warner is putting it in layman’s terms: When the president of the United States asks the F.B.I. director to drop an investigation, and then fires him, everyone knows what’s going on.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:18 AM ET   Trump has a open schedule this morning, and we hear that he is watching the hearing on television in the West Wing in a room near the Oval Office, with his private counsel Marc Kasowitz as well as senior advisers.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:19 AM ET   One big question: Will he tweet? Last time Comey testified on Capitol Hill, the president tweeted in real time, and Comey was even asked to respond to some of those remarks.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:19 AM ET   Comey is stone-faced as Senator Warner calls Comey’s prepared statement “very disturbing,” and pauses at intervals for dramatic effect: “Think about it, the president of the United States asking the F.B.I. director to drop an investigation.” Comey’s unexpressive face evokes how he said he reacted to the president’s statements in their in-person meetings.       Mikayla Bouchard  Editor    June 8, 10:21 AM ET   Let me be clear: This is not a witch hunt, this is not fake news. It is an effort to protect our country from a new threat that will not go away anytime soon.  — Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:23 AM ET   Comey has begun to speak and reveals that it was after he was fired, and the White House and President Trump began giving “shifting explanations” for the reason that he became disturbed. “Those were lies, plain and simple,” Comey said of reports that he had lost the confidence of the F.B.I.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:23 AM ET   “The administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the F.B.I.,” Comey says.        Adam Goldman  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:23 AM ET   Comey says Trump’s “shifting explanations” over his dismissal confused the former F.B.I. director and “increasingly” concerned him.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:23 AM ET   Comey pulling no punches: “The administration chose to defame me and more importantly the F.B.I. by saying the organization was in disarray, that it was being poorly led, that the workforce had lost faith in its leader. Those were lies, plain and simple.”        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:23 AM ET   Adam, what is Comey’s reputation like at the F.B.I. and what do people there think of what’s happening today?        Adam Goldman  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:23 AM ET   Comey was much beloved at the F.B.I. and people were angered by the administration’s smearing of Comey’s reputation and they way he was fired.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:27 AM ET   Was General Michael Flynn in serious legal jeopardy when Trump asked Comey to let the inquiry into him go? Yes, Comey says. “There was an open F.B.I. criminal investigation,” he says, declining to characterize the president’s comments as possible obstruction of justice.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:28 AM ET   We have entered the question-and-answer portion of this hearing, and Burr, the committee chairman, poses one of the central issues to Comey: When Trump asked Comey to “let it go” regarding the investigation of Michael Flynn, the ousted national security adviser, and his communications with the Russians, “Did you sense that the president was trying to obstruct justice, or just seek for a way for Mike Flynn to save face?”        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:32 AM ET   Comey’s answer about Michael Flynn adds a new detail — Flynn was already facing a criminal investigation when he was forced out of the White House in February, Comey said. The Times and others have reported that was the case, but the White House has pushed back, and there was no public F.B.I. confirmation until today.        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:32 AM ET   Also, a question for those who know better: If Flynn was under criminal investigation when Trump asked Comey to back off, does that inch the president closer to obstruction of justice?        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:33 AM ET   Comey won’t go any further than to say he found Trump’s request “concerning,” and says it’s up to the special counsel to determine if there is obstruction. To what extent do folks think Comey is cooperating/collaborating behind the scenes with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel?        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:33 AM ET   And does that comment indicate that Mueller is already investigating whether the president obstructed justice?           Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:33 AM ET   It’s hard, as Comey points out, to answer some of these questions as hypotheticals. At play are a lot of judgment calls based on specific sets of facts – many of which he’s not at liberty to talk about in this forum.  Nonetheless, that doesn’t seem to have hindered much of his testimony so far.        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:34 AM ET   We haven’t gotten a clear answer on whether Mueller is actively investigating obstruction of justice. But the freedom to do so is in the terms of his appointment.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:34 AM ET   Here is a primer on Trump’s interactions with Comey and obstruction of justice.    Photo         What Is Obstruction of Justice? An Often Murky Crime, Explained   A look at what qualifies as obstructing justice, and whether the accusations against President Trump could fit in that definition.    The New York Times            Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:34 AM ET   And here is a primer on all the legal troubles Michael Flynn is facing.    Photo         How Michael Flynn May Have Run Afoul of the Law   Mr. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, faces potential legal problems over money he made from foreign entities and what he has told investigators.    The New York Times            Matt Apuzzo  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:36 AM ET   That was an important moment: Comey saying for the record that the existence of a special counsel investigation should not put an end to the Senate investigation.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:37 AM ET   Burr asks whether the “tarmac meeting” between then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton in the spring of 2016 was a factor in his decision to make public his findings in the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, and his conclusion that there were no grounds for prosecution. Comey answers: “Yes, in an ultimately conclusive way.”        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:38 AM ET   Further to Matt Apuzzo’s point, after the appointment of the special counsel, some Republican senators had said that it meant the Senate and House investigations into Russia would now need to take a back seat or simply fade away. Comey just very publicly refuted that idea.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:39 AM ET   Comey says he started documenting conversations with Trump from the start because “I was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting.”        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:39 AM ET   Among the other reasons, Comey says, is that they were alone and that the subject matter pertained to a highly sensitive ongoing investigation.       Mikayla Bouchard  Editor    June 8, 10:39 AM ET   I knew that there might come a day when I would need a record of what happened.  — James B. Comey        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:40 AM ET   Comey is making clear here that he never trusted Trump from the very beginning.        Adam Goldman  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:40 AM ET   Comey says Trump’s conduct will fall within scope of counterintelligence investigation.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:43 AM ET   After discussing his worry that Trump “might lie about the nature of our meeting,” Comey says he didn’t feel the need to contemporaneously document his private conversations with George W. Bush or Barack Obama.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:43 AM ET   Comey is trying to explain why he decided to tell Trump in January that he was not personally under investigation, and his comments make it clear that that was a judgment call with which some others in the F.B.I. disagreed.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:44 AM ET   Comey says he isn’t certain whether he recorded the details of all conversations he had with Trump. His written testimony provided deep detail on five one-on-one interactions – three in person, two by phone.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:45 AM ET   Comey says he thought Trump was seeking quid pro quo in letting him stay on as F.B.I. director: “He is looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job.”        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:46 AM ET   Comey reveals that in that infamous Blue Room episode in January, in which Comey was trying to blend into the curtains and Trump called him over and half-embraced, half-shook his hand, the president whispered in his ear: “I really look forward to working with you.”        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:46 AM ET   I’ll admit that I am struck by how forthright Comey is being about his judgment calls. He is not dissembling, or trying too hard to justify himself. He is just saying that he made a call and others disagreed.        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:47 AM ET   That said, he clearly believes he has a favorable story to tell — and that he is not the one who is going to be judged harshly today.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:49 AM ET   A former federal prosecutor texted me that the patronage quid pro quo stuff could be a separate crime: trading an official act (keeping public job) for private gain — like the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich and Obama’s vacated Senate seat.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:50 AM ET   Warner observes as he closes his questioning that the committee really wants to get ahold of the memos Comey kept documenting his private conversations with Trump. I’m a little surprised they don’t have them yet.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:51 AM ET   Senator James Risch, Republican of Idaho, starts his questioning  by getting Comey to reassert what he has now acknowledged several times, that Trump was not himself under investigation. If they’re going to sit through a hearing that contains potentially damaging revelations about the president, Republicans are at least going to take maximum advantage of driving home that point.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:53 AM ET   Risch parses the president’s words to Comey regarding the Flynn investigation. “He did not direct you to let it go. He did not order you to let it go,” Risch says. “He said ‘I hope.’”        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:54 AM ET   Risch is trying to make a very fine legal distinction on the question of obstruction of justice, arguing that since Trump said to Comey of the Flynn probe “I hope you can let this go,” it was not an order or directive. Charlie, how important is the exact wording here?        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:54 AM ET   Or is it more important what Comey took away? He says: “I took it as a direction. He’s the president of the United States, with me alone, saying, ‘I hope this.’ I took it as this is what he wants me to do.”        Adam Goldman  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:55 AM ET   Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, is now asking questions and begins by asking Comey why he thinks he was fired.  Comey says he doesn’t know why he was fired but would take president’s word that he was dismissed over his handling of the Russia investigation.        Adam Goldman  Washington Reporter    June 8, 10:56 AM ET   Comey says that his relationship didn’t get off to a good start with the president.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 10:56 AM ET   For those of you just joining us, we’re watching the testimony of the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  You can get caught up on the key points so far here .       Mikayla Bouchard  Editor    June 8, 10:58 AM ET   I’ve seen his tweet about the tapes. Lordy, I hope there are tapes.  — James B. Comey, speaking about President Trump’s suggestion in a tweet that he might have recorded his conversations with Comey.           Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:00 AM ET   Julie, going back to your question earlier about exactly what the president said to Comey about dropping the Flynn investigation. The wording — and more importantly, how to interpret it — could be crucial. Comey said to Senator Risch that he took it as a direction, but he disobeyed. Risch said “I hope” wasn’t a direction. This is like the famous line Henry II is said to have uttered about Thomas Becket, which his minions took to be a direction to murder him: “Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?”       Mikayla Bouchard  Editor    June 8, 11:01 AM ET   Maybe if I were stronger, I would have. I was so stunned by the conversation that I just took it in.  — James B. Comey, on why he didn’t tell President Trump his questions were inappropriate        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:05 AM ET   Comey and Trump have essentially been shadowboxing via leaks, interviews and Twitter since the president fired him. Comey is now very directly and publicly challenging Trump, saying he relishes the full story of their interactions coming out and implying it will not be good for the president.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:05 AM ET   Comey recounts how he came to the decision not to inform anyone else outside the senior F.B.I. leadership of his disturbing exchange with Trump. He said a main concern was, “We can’t infect the investigative team,” but a secondary one was that there was essentially no one appropriate to tell at the Justice Department.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:07 AM ET   Comey says colleagues at the F.B.I. were “as shocked and troubled as I was” when he informed them of his interactions with Trump. He says it was a struggle what exactly to do with the information, noting there were few Senate-confirmed officials at the Justice Department to whom he could turn. Though he communicated general discomfort to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he never reported the details of his conversations with the president to Justice officials.    Photo         Comey Told Sessions: Don’t Leave Me Alone With Trump   The F.B.I. director did not tell the attorney general why a meeting the day before with President Trump, in which the president sought to end an investigation, had unnerved him.    The New York Times            Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:07 AM ET   He believed, correctly, that Attorney General Jeff Sessions would soon have to recuse himself, and there was no other politically appointed person in the leadership to go to.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:08 AM ET   Under questioning by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, Comey makes clear a very important point. In wanting “the cloud” lifted, Trump was asking him to make a public statement that Trump himself was not personally under investigation (as Comey had said privately) — not to drop the entire Russia investigation.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:08 AM ET   This is the first we’ve heard of another concern of Comey’s, that he recognized he had no way to corroborate these interactions with Trump, and, “it’s your word against his.” Of course, that’s not the case if there are tapes, he notes.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:08 AM ET   So this is the second time (the first was in his prepared testimony released yesterday) Comey has said that he expected Sessions to recuse himself. It’s intriguing. I wonder how he knew that or why he suspected it? We know that Trump was irate that Sessions ultimately did so.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:11 AM ET   Good point, Julie. An interesting figure here is the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who has ultimate supervisory authority over the special counsel investigation and whom no senator has yet mentioned in questioning. We know from The Times’s reporting that Comey is somewhat skeptical of Rosenstein, whose reputation is that of a by-the-book prosecutor who’s transcended politics. But as Comey told a friend : “He’s good, he’s solid but he’s also a survivor, and you don’t survive that long without making some compromises and I’m concerned about that.”       Mikayla Bouchard  Editor    June 8, 11:12 AM ET   I believe the timing of your firing stinks.  — Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:12 AM ET   Well so far, the president’s Twitter feed is silent, but his son, Donald Trump Jr., is essentially live-tweeting this, undercutting Comey’s every assertion.   Hoping and telling are two very different things, you would think that a guy like Comey would know that. #givemeabreak  — Donald Trump Jr. on Twitter ( donaldjtrumpjr )         Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:12 AM ET    3/3 Knowing my father for 39 years when he “orders or tells” you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means  — Donald Trump Jr. on Twitter ( donaldjtrumpjr )         Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:13 AM ET   Senator Wyden is questioning whether the attorney general was really and truly recused, given his involvement in Comey’s firing. “I don’t have an answer for the question,” Comey says.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:13 AM ET   For those of you just joining us, we’re watching the testimony of the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  You can get caught up on the key points here .        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:16 AM ET   Now Wyden is broadening his line of inquiry beyond Trump, to try to get Comey to talk about what Vice President Mike Pence and Sessions might have known about Flynn.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:17 AM ET   Asked by Wyden how the investigation would have been affected had he done what Trump wanted, Comey says: “We would have closed any investigation of General Flynn in connection with his statements about and encounters with Russians in the late part of December. We would have dropped an open criminal investigation.”  The "AND encounters with” part is interesting — that implies the component of the Flynn investigation that is focused on his phone calls with the Russian ambassador may go beyond later making false statements about whether they had discussed sanctions.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:18 AM ET   Some lawmakers have raised questions about whether the deputy attorney general, too, ought to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, given his likely role as a witness: He wrote a memo that laid the foundation for Comey’s firing. If Comey’s firing was indeed tied to the Russia investigation, as the president has suggested and has Comey has said today he believes, that creates a problem.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:19 AM ET   Comey on why he volunteered to Trump that he wasn’t under investigation: “I was very conscious of being in kind of a J. Edgar Hoover-type situation. I was very keen not to leave him with the impression that the bureau was trying to do something to him.”        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:20 AM ET   There is a bigger question that we all want to know: When did Trump know about Flynn’s phone calls with the Russian ambassador at the end of the December? It was the phone calls that led to Flynn’s firing in February. The White House said Flynn had to go because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about the content of the conversations with the Russian ambassador (they were talking about American sanctions).        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:21 AM ET   But no one at the White House has yet been willing to tell us when Trump knew about Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:21 AM ET   Comey is basically saying he was trying to make it clear to Trump that there was no attempt to blackmail him or undercut him, which shows a keen understanding of how the president thinks. Trump often uses the term “witch hunt,” and has clearly interpreted the Russia investigation into a personal attack on him.        Adam Goldman  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:23 AM ET   Comey says the president wasn’t under investigation at the time he was fired. He also clarified that when he told the president he was not under counterintelligence investigation, that also included any other type of criminal investigation.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:25 AM ET   Bombshell: Comey recounts that he leaked the contents of his memo through a friend, with the express aim of getting a special counsel named.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:26 AM ET   And here again we have an example of a Trump tweet ending up coming back to haunt him. Comey says what prompted him to authorize the leak of his memo was the president’s tweet suggesting there could be tapes of their meetings.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:27 AM ET   He says he woke up in the middle of the night a few days later and decided he had to get his version out.  Here’s that tweet from May 12:   James Comey better hope that there are no “tapes” of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  — Donald J. Trump on Twitter ( realdonaldtrump )         Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:29 AM ET   After Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said, “The president never should have cleared the room and he never should have asked you, as you reported, to let it go, to let the investigation go,” she asks why, even if Comey was too stunned to think of it at the time, he didn’t have the Justice Department complain to White House. Comey says he did press in general not to be left alone with the president again, but did not want to “alert the White House” about the specific issue because “it was of investigative interest for us to try to figure out what just happened.” Meaning, he was thinking about obstruction of justice from that moment.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:29 AM ET   “There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever,” Comey says. Russia interfered in the presidential election “with purpose,” and “that’s about as un-fake as you can get.”        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:30 AM ET   Comey also says that he had no conversation with President Trump about the interference or how to avoid a repeat.           Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:31 AM ET   Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, seizing on the he said-he said element, asks: “Who should we believe?”        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:32 AM ET   Great point, Charlie, about how Comey was thinking about potential obstruction by Trump as far back as January. That, coupled with what he just said about leaking the memo expressly so a special counsel would be named really fill out a more complete picture here. He laid out a very careful strategy with that in mind.       Mikayla Bouchard  Editor    June 8, 11:35 AM ET   “A really significant fact to me is, so, why did he kick everybody out of the Oval Office?”  — James Comey, on speaking with President Trump one-on-one        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:36 AM ET   For those of you just joining us, we’re watching the testimony of the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Here are a few of the key developments so far:  • Mr. Comey testified that President Trump and others in his administration had lied when they said agents had lost confidence in Mr. Comey.  • “Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” Mr. Comey said, referring to Mr. Trump’s suggestion that he may have recorded their conversations.  • Mr. Trump stayed quiet, at least during the first 90 minutes, but his son, Donald Trump Jr., took to Twitter to defend his father.  • “Today is your opportunity to set the record straight,” the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina, said to Mr. Comey.  You can read more about the key points here .        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:36 AM ET   You can’t cherry-pick facts and statements from different witnesses, Comey says: Watch for consistency in a person’s characterizations. So far, his testimony has closely followed the details laid out yesterday in his seven pages of prepared testimony.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:37 AM ET   That was a big moment, Rebecca, when he talked about not cherry-picking. It was an implicit rebuttal of the White House and Republican line on Comey’s testimony – that everyone should pay attention to and accept his assertion that Trump was not himself under investigation, and essentially reject every single other thing he is saying.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:39 AM ET   Under questioning from Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, Comey clarifies the investigation into Flynn regarding his late-December conversations with the Russian ambassador regarding sanctions was only about making false statements to investigators, not about the conversation itself. This puts to rest the question of whether there was ever any real-world possibility of charging him under the Logan Act, an essentially dead-letter statute against private citizens interfering in foreign affairs. Here is a primer on that:    Photo         The Logan Act: How Flynn’s Exit Revived Interest in a Dusty, Old Law   The 1799 act bars private citizens from interfering in U.S. diplomatic relations — raising questions about whether the act applies to Michael T. Flynn and the presidential transition team.    The New York Times            Adam Goldman  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:40 AM ET   Blunt asks Comey why he shared information with a friend who later gave it to a reporter. Comey says the information was his private recollections and felt he could share it outside the bureau.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:40 AM ET   Senator Blunt challenged Comey not just for sharing his memos “as a private citizen” but also for having taken Trump’s calls after he was so unnerved by in-person one-on-one interactions with the president.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:41 AM ET   One question that some of the Republican senators seem to be tiptoeing up to here without coming out and asking: Did Comey somehow try to entrap Trump by not directly expressing his concern about these interactions contemporaneously to the president or anyone on his team? Would it matter if he had?       Mikayla Bouchard  Editor    June 8, 11:42 AM ET   I don’t think Putin is a Republican or a Democrat. He’s an opportunist.  — Senator Angus King, independent of Maine        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:42 AM ET   So we just learned that Comey canceled a date with his wife to have dinner with Trump.        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:42 AM ET   Definitely a Top 5 excuse for breaking date night.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:43 AM ET   “No sir,” Comey says, denying Trump’s assertion that their one-on-one dinner at the White House in January was at Comey’s initiation and because he wanted to keep his job.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:43 AM ET   A moment of levity: Comey laughs as he says he wishes he’d gone to dinner with his wife that night after all.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:44 AM ET   Comey expresses regret for ditching his wife for the president, a decision that may have changed the course of history. “In retrospect, I love spending time with my wife, I wish I had been there that night.”        Adam Goldman  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:44 AM ET   Look for White House and Republicans to attack Comey for using a friend to leak information to a reporter about his interactions with the president, triggering a special counsel.        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:45 AM ET   King asks if Flynn is a central part of the investigation, or even part of the Russia investigation. Comey says he cannot answer that in an open session, but The Times and other news organizations have reported that Flynn is indeed a central part of the Russia investigation.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:47 AM ET   King follows up on Senator Risch’s line of questioning. Risch had dismissed Trump’s “I hope you can let this go…” statement as a suggestion, not an order. But Comey says he interpreted it – coming from the president – as a directive.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:49 AM ET   Comey said of the memos he wrote memorializing his conversations with Trump: “I turned them over to Mueller’s investigators.” Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma asks for copies for the intelligence committee, the second member to mention that today.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:51 AM ET   “This seems like a pretty light touch” that Trump used to get Comey to drop the Flynn investigation, Lankford says, noting that no other member of his administration followed up nor did the president return to the request again.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:53 AM ET   Comey argues that the effect was profound nonetheless, given the context – Trump kicking everyone out of the room to look him in the eye and ask him to drop it. If F.B.I. agents had known about it, he says, “There’s a real risk of a chilling effect on their work.” Again, key questions about what constitutes obstruction.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:54 AM ET   “Quite frankly, the president has informed about six billion people he’s not quite fond of this investigation,” Lankford says, seeking to compare Trump’s public comments on the inquiry to the private ones he made to Comey. Comey emphasizes: There’s a difference.        Adam Goldman  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:55 AM ET   Comey once again repeats that the F.B.I. had opened a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. It was not a “matter,” Comey says.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:58 AM ET   Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, praises Comey for candidly answering questions in contrast to yesterday’s hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee at which the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, and the director of the National Security Agency, Mike Rogers, refused to answer questions even though they were not classified and Trump had not invoked executive privilege.  The deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, and the acting director of the F.B.I., Andrew McCabe, also refused to talk about Russia and the Comey firing at Wednesday’s hearing, irritating senators.     Photo         Intelligence Officials Sidestep Senate Questions on Trump and Russia   The national intelligence director and the head of the N.S.A. drew criticism from senators for their reluctance to speak about President Trump’s conduct.    The New York Times           Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 11:59 AM ET   Comey to Trump: “Release all the tapes. I’m good with it.”        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 11:59 AM ET   “This is a big deal and people need to recognize it,” Comey says about Russia’s interference in last year’s election, displaying the most emotion he has so far today. “They’re coming after Americans,” he says. “They will be back, because we remain – as difficult as we can be with each other – we remain that shining city on the hill.”        Adam Goldman  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:01 PM ET   Comey says President Trump never told him that he was performing badly. One time the president called him to tell Comey he was doing an awesome job.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:01 PM ET   For all of you glued to the Comey testimony, Trump is scheduled to speak shortly, at a Faith & Freedom Coalition event in Northwest Washington, across town from the Capitol. The speech is scheduled for 12:35 p.m. The president has been publicly silent so far today. It will be interesting to see whether he makes any reference to these proceedings there, before an audience that includes some very strong supporters.           Adam Goldman  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:02 PM ET   Comey was asked if the president’s comments would rise to the level of obstruction. Comey said he didn’t know and it was the special counsel’s job to find out.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:05 PM ET   Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, diverts from discussion of Trump’s interactions with Comey  to whether Trump colluded with Russia, and seems to expect a flat denial. Comey doesn’t give it.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:06 PM ET   Cotton: “Do you believe Donald Trump colluded with Russia?”  Comey: “That’s a question I don’t think I should answer in an open setting. When I left, we did not have an open investigation into President Trump.”  That’s quite a bit short of a blanket “no.”        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:06 PM ET   The most-repeated questions so far: Did Trump obstruct justice? Will Comey submit his memos to Congress? And why, as Cotton is now asking, did Comey not document his conversations with previous presidents or attorneys general? Comey has remained steady and patient, not showing signs of frustration. He won’t comment on obstruction; we’ll see about the memos. His interactions with Trump were unusual – and more frequent – and he found them unnerving.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:09 PM ET   President Trump has left the White House for his scheduled speech, according to the press pool. There is talk of a potential statement to the pool by his private attorney, Marc Kasowitz, upon Trump’s arrival. That ought to be interesting, if it materializes.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:10 PM ET   Comey declines to weigh in on the content of intercepted communications with Russia – not just because he’s in a public forum, but because he’s been out of government for a month. Maybe, he says, he’ll provide what more information he knows in a closed session with the senators later today.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:12 PM ET   Comey declines to answer a string of questions from Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California: Are there other meetings or key communications between Trump administration officials and Russians that have been to date undisclosed?        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:14 PM ET   For those of you who want to go back and check something that was said at the hearing, we have a transcript. At the moment, we only have the first 20 or so minutes in there, but we’ll be updating it until it is complete.     Photo         Video and Partial Transcript: James Comey’s Testimony on Capitol Hill   The following is a partial transcript of the former F.B.I. director’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, as prepared by the Federal News Service.    The New York Times           Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:17 PM ET   A few minutes back, Senator Cotton pointed out that Comey wrote a letter of resignation during the famous “hospital room” episode in 2004 , when he was the acting attorney general and he and other Justice Department officials threatened to quit over the Bush White House’s decision to continue aspects of the Stellarwind surveillance and data collection program even though the department had decided they were illegal.
 (Comey didn’t quit after President George W. Bush backed down and agreed to stop the illegal aspects.)  Cotton got Comey to acknowledge he never wrote such a letter during the Trump months. Cotton characterizes the 2004 episode as being merely an honest, if serious, disagreement among lawyers, suggesting the Trump matters were even less than that.  Comey replied: “I wouldn’t characterize the circumstances of 2004 that way.” Here is an article about that dispute, which contributed to Comey’s reputation as a defender of the rule of law and President Obama’s decision to name him as F.B.I. director even though he was a Republican.    New Leak Suggests Ashcroft Confrontation Was Over N.S.A. Program   A draft of the 2009 report, given to The Guardian by Edward J. Snowden, indicates that in 2004, White House officials wanted Attorney General John Ashcroft to sign off on a program to vacuum up Internet “metadata.”    The New York Times            Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:17 PM ET   Comey says he doesn’t remember talking to Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the Russia investigation before Sessions recused himself in early March.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:17 PM ET   While this is unfolding, our own Glenn Thrush is questioning Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary, at an off-camera White House press briefing. “I can definitively say the president is not a liar, and frankly I’m insulted by that question,” she tells him regarding the Comey account.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:19 PM ET   Sanders can’t or won’t say whether Trump has watched any of the hearing, and says of the possible existence of tapes of the Trump-Comey interactions, “I have no idea.”        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:20 PM ET   How exactly did Attorney General Sessions react when Comey asked not to be left alone with the president, in mid-February? “I don’t remember clearly,” Comey says, careful not to characterize Sessions’ body language and read into it too much. Comey’s clear about one thing: “He didn’t say anything.”        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:22 PM ET   Comey now says he considered calling for the appointment of a special counsel after the tarmac conversation between Attorney General Lynch and Bill Clinton, but concluded he shouldn’t because he knew there was nothing there.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:23 PM ET   Contrast that with his campaign to get a special counsel named in this case. He clearly believes there was wrongdoing and a real potential for a miscarriage of justice if the investigation was not further insulated.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:26 PM ET   For those of you just joining us, we’re watching the testimony of the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Here are a few of the developments so far:  • Mr. Comey testified that President Trump and others in his administration lied when they said agents had lost confidence in Mr. Comey.  • “Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” Mr. Comey said, referring to Mr. Trump’s suggestion that he may have recorded their conversations.  • Mr. Comey revealed for the first time that he turned over memos about his conversations with Mr. Trump to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.  • Mr. Trump stayed quiet, at least during the first 90 minutes, but his son, Donald Trump Jr., took to Twitter to defend his father.  You can read more on the key points here .        Matthew Rosenberg  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:29 PM ET   Mike Flynn Jr., another son with a fierce Twitter habit, has not written any of his own tweets this morning — but he has been retweeting Donald Jr.       Mikayla Bouchard  Editor    June 8, 12:30 PM ET   I was fired because of the Russia investigation. I was fired in some way to change — or the endeavor was to change the way in which the investigation was being conducted.  — James B. Comey        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:32 PM ET   Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, asked Comey what prompted him to inform the president he was not personally under investigation, as Comey said he first did on Jan. 6 at Trump Tower, without Trump having directly asked that question.  “My view was that what I said to the president was accurate and fair, and fair to him,” Comey said. He said he drew the line at making such a statement publicly, not wanting to have to correct it should the situation change, and due to “the slippery slope problem.”        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:32 PM ET   And Comey comes back to Trump’s Twitter feed as a protagonist in this saga, and says when the president made his comment about recordings, he thought to himself, “Holy cow, there might be tapes, and if there are tapes, it’s not just my word against his” regarding the attempt by Trump to get him to drop the Flynn investigation.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:34 PM ET   Senator John McCain’s line of questioning about what ended in July 2016 seems confusing. He appears to be conflating the Hillary Clinton email server investigation and the Russia interference in election investigation.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:39 PM ET   McCain says there’s a “double standard” with Hillary Clinton and Trump, that Comey has said she had no involvement with Russia but is still investigating Trump’s. But there never was an investigation into Clinton’s possible collusion with Russia, it was about her use of email, as Charlie noted. Very difficult to follow what he might have been trying to get at there.        Charlie Savage  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:39 PM ET   McCain asks why Comey didn’t follow up when Trump said he’d been loyal to Comey and “we had that thing you know.” Comey said it didn’t seem necessary for the conversation, but “I took it to be an effort to communicate to me that ‘there is a relationship between us where I’ve been good to you; you should be good to me.'”        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:41 PM ET   Senator Burr, the committee chairman, is wrapping up with a statement praising Comey and the F.B.I., and making it clear that he believes his version of events. “We’re grateful to you for your service to your country [and for] being somebody that loves his country enough to tell it like it is.”        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:43 PM ET   “The macro issue of what the Russians did and continue to do,” Senator Warner says, “is real.”        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:43 PM ET   “We’re going to get to the bottom of this,” Warner says in closing. “We’re going to get the facts out.” And with that, mayhem in the hearing room as photographers jostle for their shots and everyone stands.        Rebecca R. Ruiz  Washington Reporter    June 8, 12:43 PM ET   Gavel down. The hearing is adjourned, though the senators will reconvene for a closed session with Comey later this afternoon.        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:44 PM ET   Thanks everyone for chatting! That was a remarkable few hours.  Here were a few of the developments:  • James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, testified that President Trump and others in his administration lied when they said agents had lost confidence in Mr. Comey.  • “Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” Mr. Comey said, referring to Mr. Trump’s suggestion that he may have recorded their conversations.  • Mr. Comey revealed for the first time that he turned over memos about his conversations with Mr. Trump to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.  • Mr. Trump stayed quiet, at least during the first 90 minutes, but his son, Donald Trump Jr., took to Twitter to defend his father.  You can read more on the key points here .        Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 12:46 PM ET        Comey Testimony: Trump Administration Lied About Him and Defamed F.B.I.   “Those were lies, plain and simple,” Mr. Comey said in brief opening remarks. Mr. Trump made that claim when he fired Mr. Comey last month. Mr. Comey said he was confused and concerned by Mr. Trump’s changing explanation for why he fired him. Mr. Comey learned of his firing from the news media.    The New York Times          Video and Partial Transcript: James Comey’s Testimony on Capitol Hill   The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence exists to certify for the other 85 members of the United States Senate and the American people that the intelligence community is operating lawfully and has the necessary authorities and tools to accomplish its mission and keep America safe.    The New York Times           Julie Hirschfeld Davis  White House Correspondent    June 8, 1:00 PM ET   Finally, a closing note: In his testimony, Mr. Comey questioned the accuracy of a New York Times report from February. We’re looking into it, and we will report back with more information as soon as we can.
