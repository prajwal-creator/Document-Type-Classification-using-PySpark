Times Insider offers behind-the-scenes insights into news, features and opinion at The New York Times. The New York Times Credit Video by Madison Mills For more than a year, there has been a seat on the United States Supreme Court left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia. The result? A case of political gridlock. Judge Merrick B. Garland, nominated by President Obama, was denied consideration for almost a year by Senate Republicans, and now Democrats promise to give Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s pick, exceptionally close scrutiny. Come hear Jake Silverstein, the editor of The New York Times Magazine, in conversation with Emily Bazelon, a writer for the Magazine, and Adam Liptak, a correspondent covering the Supreme Court, as they explore what this impasse means for the judicial health of the United States and where the court will go from here. Times Insiders will be notified of the event location and the ticketing details over email.
