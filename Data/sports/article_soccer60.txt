The Bianconeri won their 28th league title Sunday when they defeated Cagliari, 2-0, to stay unbeaten and second-place A.C. Milan lost, 4-2, to Inter Milan in the next-to-last round of the season. Juventus is four points ahead of Milan. It has been a long road since the 2005 and 2006 titles were stripped from Juventus and it was relegated to Serie B, but under the young coach Antonio Conte, one of Italy’s oldest clubs proved it was back to its best once more. It is a fitting end to the Juventus career of the legendary striker Alessandro Del Piero, who is leaving the club at the end of the season. Del Piero has spent almost his entire career at Juventus after signing from Padova in 1993, and he stuck by the club when it was relegated.

Sometimes it doesn’t happen, but what happened today rewards me for so many years, starting from 2006. In two weeks, we have another game we want to win. “I’ve experienced my story here very well, with great enthusiasm and happiness. I just want to smile, and that’s it. There’s time to talk about the rest. This title has even more value also because of the year we spent in Serie B. I will celebrate it to the max because each win has a special taste.” Conte played for Juventus the last time it won the league officially. He spent 13 years with the Bianconeri, winning five league titles before retiring in 2004. The debate over whether it is Juventus’s 28th or 30th title is set to run and run. Conte refused to be baited on the subject, saying: “It’s the first for me. It’s the first that I’ve won as a coach.” Conte became Juventus coach in the offseason, after achieving promotion from Serie B with Siena. The 42-year-old has enjoyed an incredible season in charge, and Juventus could cap it by becoming only the second team to win the title without losing a game. A.C. Milan did it under Fabio Capello in 1992. “It is a fantastic sensation,” Conte said. “We are really happy, the lads deserved it and it’s an honor to win it.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a double for Milan. It will be the first time since 2004 that the former Ajax, Juventus, Inter and Barcelona striker will not be on the team with the most league points.

Turkey clears clubs The Turkish soccer federation cleared all 16 Turkish teams, including Fenerbahce, of involvement in an alleged match-fixing scandal, but it also banned two players for as long as three years and imposed disciplinary measures on eight players or club officials, according to the federation’s Web site, The Associated Press reported Monday from Ankara. “There is no reason for punishment, since the elements of the alleged disciplinary violation have not materialized,” the federation said in a statement late Sunday. Fenerbahce was barred from the Champions League this season as a result of the investigation. The announcement came a week after the federation said an independent soccer ethics committee looking into the match-fixing allegations concluded that there was no evidence that alleged attempts to fix games had altered the course of 22 matches tainted by the allegations. It was not clear whether the federation’s decision would satisfy European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, which had said it would intervene if the Turkish federation’s disciplinary body failed to take any action before a June 1 deadline to register clubs for European competitions. A total of 93 officials, players and coaches, including the president of Fenerbahce, the defending champion, are on trial, accused of helping fix matches last season. The federation’s decision could affect the course of the trial, which was relying in part on the federation’s guidance. The Turkish federation banned striker Ibrahim Akin of Istanbul Buyuksehir Belediyesi for three years on allegations that he fixed the result of a game when his team lost to Fenerbahce, 2-0, on May 1, 2011. It also banned Serdar Kulbilge of Genclerbirligi for two years over an alleged attempt to fix the result of a game that Fenerbahce won, 4-2.
