To move directly to the most recent answer, click here . Mr. Tommasini, who is also a pianist and an author, joined The Times in 1997 and was promoted to his current position in 2000. Before joining The Times, he covered music and theater for The Boston Globe. He has also written about dance, jazz, rap, books and AIDS. He graduated from Yale University in 1970, and later earned a master's degree from the Yale School of Music and a doctor of musical arts degree from Boston University. His teachers have included the pianists Donald Currier and Leonard Shure. He has taught music at Emerson College in Boston, and given non-fiction writing workshops at Wesleyan University and Brandeis University. In 1997, his book "Virgil Thomson: Composer on the Aisle" was published by W.W. Norton & Company. In 2004, Times Books/Henry Holt released his book "Opera: A Critic's Guide to the 100 Most Important Works and the Best Recordings," which includes a primer for newcomers to opera. As a pianist, Mr. Tommasini recorded two Northeastern Records compact discs of Thomson's music, titled "Portraits and Self-Portraits," and "Mostly About Love: Songs and Vocal Works," both financed through grants from the National Endowment for the Arts.

He often heard Bernstein conduct the Philharmonic , including a stunning concert that delivered the one-two punch of Beethoven 's "Eroica" Symphony and Stravinsky 's "Rite of Spring." He attended every recital he could get to that the pianist Rudolf Serkin played. By his late teens, he was quite an opera buff even though he took in performances at the Met from the stratosphere or standing room. Among the most memorable performances, he said, were hearing Renata Tebaldi (twice!) as Desdemona in Verdi 's "Otello," Leontyne Price in Verdi's "Aida" and "Il Trovatore," Birgit Nilsson in Puccini 's "Turandot" and Joan Sutherland in Donizetti 's "Lucia di Lammermoor." Another overwhelming performance, the summer before Mr. Tommasini left for freshman year at Yale, was hearing Stravinsky conduct his "Symphony of Psalms" at a Stravinsky Festival at Lincoln Center.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       He started out his professional life teaching music at the college level and performing as a pianist, including lots of chamber music and vocal accompanying. "As a critic, I still think of myself as a kind of teacher," Mr. Tommasini said. "And, having been a performer, I know how hard it is, which makes me, I hope, a more sensitive critic. I've been there. "I think it is essential for music critics to cover and champion the important and exciting music of today. My musical tastes are wide-ranging. I love both Messiaen and Mozart , Stravinsky and Stephen Sondheim . I think Frank Loesser 's 'Guys and Dolls' is on a par with Britten 's 'Peter Grimes.' " Mr. Tommasini lives in Manhattan with his partner, Dr. Benjamin McCommon, a psychiatrist. Other Times staff members have answered questions in this column, including Executive Editor Bill Keller, Managing Editor Jill Abramson, Managing Editor John Geddes, Assistant Managing Editor Glenn Kramon, Associate Managing Editor Charles Strum, Obituaries Editor Bill McDonald, Metropolitan Editor Joe Sexton, Living Editor Trish Hall, Investigations Editor Matthew Purdy, National Editor Suzanne Daley, Sports Editor Tom Jolly and Culture Editor Sam Sifton. Their responses and those of other Times staff members are available on the Talk to the Newsroom page. These discussions will continue in coming weeks with other Times editors and reporters. Classical Music in the 21st Century Q. We seem to be in a very eclectic time for classical music. Composers produce all kinds of music, from the atonal to things that sound more like noise than music, to fusions with traditional folk instruments, to things that are basically purely diatonic. My question is, how would you describe the classical musical landscape in the early 21st century, and do you foresee any resolution of these many trends with a coherent theoretical framework? A. You raise an important issue, something I think about all the time. I agree that the landscape for classical music today is more diverse and eclectic than ever. Somehow, the word "eclectic" has become a pejorative. But I like that word and what it conveys, and I'm thrilled that the classical music scene today is so alive with variety and experiment, so open to harmonic idioms of all kinds, so embracing of fusion with world music, folk music, rock, so eclectic! Much has been written about the terrible decades of the 1960s, '70s and '80s, when, the story goes, the 12-tone composers who held secure teaching posts at universities treated with disdain those composers who still favored tonal harmonic idioms. It's simplistic to view that period this way. Still, I remember being a music student at Yale in the early 1970s, when to mention during lunch that I liked the operas of Britten would bring withering looks from composers and composition teachers.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Those days, thank goodness, are long gone. Young composers today neither know nor care about the stylistic wars of earlier decades. They feel free to write any music, any way they choose. And good for them. I have written for years of my enthusiasm for the 12-tone and atonal works that excite and move me. The problem back then was not the music itself but the dogma surrounding it. Today we live in wonderfully undogmatic times. So I'm not sure I could describe the compositional landscape today, as you ask me to. And I'm not sure that's a very essential thing to do. Shouldn't we embrace the diversity and count ourselves lucky? Also, it's important to remember that when we look back to earlier eras — the Romantic period, Viennese Classicism, the Italian Baroque, and so on — it may seem to us that "coherent theoretical frameworks," as you put it, prevailed back then. But there was actually a great deal of diversity and stylistic conflict. Way before Schoenberg , composers from Monteverdi to Gluck to Wagner were considered radicals. Right now, the Metropolitan Opera is presenting a revival of Francesco Cilea's " Adriana Lecouvreur ," a verismo melodrama from 1902, not a great work, but a very skillfully written and effective opera composed in a fairly conventional, though elegant, harmonic language. Just consider what else was being written around that time. There was Debussy 's opera "Pelleas et Melisande," Schoenberg's massive orchestral tone poem "Pelleas und Melisande." and Strauss 's "Salome." So I'm not sure we should spend much energy searching for coherence in the compositional scene today. Thanks for the question, Mark. Soloists vs. Orchestras in Concertos Q. Soloists sometimes take far greater liberties in rubato than the conductor/orchestra in a concerto (not during cadenzas), e.g. the Brahms First Piano Concerto. I find such disparities can strongly detract from a performance and would appreciate your thoughts. A. Let me start my answer by trying to define, for those who need some help, this loose term "rubato." It describes the practice of playing with expressive and rhythmic freedom. Specifically "tempo rubato" means "robbed time," a term that indicates that strict time in a passage is ignored temporarily while some time is "robbed" from one passage or group of notes and given to another. There are intense debates within the field over the degree of rubato that is considered tasteful and appropriate. Though rubato is a hard term to define, most people in an audience instinctively hear what is going on when a performer plays with pronounced rubato, as when a violinist pulls and tugs at the melodic line. Now, you are certainly right that often in a concerto performance the soloist will play with more rubato, more rhythmic freedom, that is, than the orchestra. In chamber music, performers who may have different approaches and styles spend a great deal of time in rehearsal coming to terms and fashioning a coherent interpretation. Ideally, this should apply to a concerto performance as well. Sometimes, conductors can be too deferential to star soloists, and sometimes, frankly, there is simply not enough rehearsal time for a conductor to come to complete agreement with a strong-willed soloist.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Yet the issue is complicated by the fact that there is a David and Goliath quality to a concerto performance. That's part of what makes this genre so popular with audiences. So, sometimes, when there seems to be a tussle going on between the hotshot virtuoso pianist and the master conductor in a performance of the Brahms First Concerto, this can enhance the excitement of the performance, at least for some listeners. Not for me, generally. But that's the way it works. The Overlooked Operas Q. Opera companies regularly perform works from the standard repertory.  Are there any neglected, forgotten or never-seen operas, from any time period, that you think would be very popular if performed today?  And, what can you personally do to get them performed? Your articles are wonderful to read, and I am so pleased you are an out and proud gay man who mentions his partner. A. Thanks for the nice note and the good question, Bob. Most opera buffs have lists of works they consider neglected. When I was young, performances of Baroque operas were rarities. But look at what has happened in the last 25 years or so? Handel has become practically as popular as Puccini . For a while I thought Gluck was neglected, but more recently masterpieces like Gluck's "Iphigenie en Tauride" and "Alceste" are getting their due. Steadily, the Britten works beyond "Peter Grimes" and "Billy Budd" are entering the repertory, and Janacek is on a roll at major companies, something I thought would never happen. So for me the neglected works I want to see produced are from recent decades. Hugo Weisgall 's "Esther," a craggy, atonal and gripping opera, earned an ecstatic ovation from a stunned audience when the New York City Opera gave the world premiere in 1993, but it has not been produced since. The composer Judith Weir has written some musically smart and dramatically vivid works that get produced in Great Britain but seldom in America. There is her wonderful chamber opera "A Night at the Chinese Opera." I'd love to see a New York production of it. The composer Lewis Spratlan won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize in Music for a concert performance of Act II of his opera "Life is a Dream." That act, presented by the New York City Opera in a workshop, is amazing. But the complete opera has never been produced! How is that possible? Still, opera companies have been doing pretty well at bringing important neglected works to production. The question to ask is whether it might be helpful to us buffs, to the field at large and to the repertory if companies gave the staples — "Boheme," "Barber of Seville," "Traviata" and such — some time off once in a while. The Case for Sensitivity Q. In your profile, you are quoted as saying "…having been a performer, I know how hard it is, which makes me, I hope, a more sensitive critic. I've been there." Why treat classical music sensitively? And why use an affinity of experience to sensitively shade criticism of current practitioners? Couldn't this open up critics to apology and punch-pulling when artists aren't quite up to snuff?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A. Your question raises some issues central to criticism, at least as I see it. Let me try to deal with them one at a time. I'm not sure what you mean exactly when you ask "why treat classical music sensitively?" Surely it is good for the field, let alone good manners, for a critic to approach each performance with sensitivity. Classical music is a fine arts form. Even when I'm covering a major orchestra at Carnegie Hall or a fancy new production at the powerful Metropolitan Opera , these events are not the equivalents of $100 million commercial Hollywood movies. I want classical music to thrive, to be healthy. I have prodded institutions to take chances and be bold, to teach, to reach out. And I should hold performers, especially the major institutions, to high standards. Still, I start off wanting to be as encouraging as possible, to be, yes, sensitive. Remember, many of the concerts and operas I attend are presented not by the stars in the field, but by impressively dedicated performers who are sacrificing a great deal to pursue their art. If a New York-based pianist in his 30s —  someone who may have a part-time teaching job, who plays in various chamber ensembles and a contemporary music group and maybe accompanies a singer or two —  if that young, highly trained artist makes an income of close to $40,000, this is a major success story in classical music. Virgil Thomson , my mentor as a critic, who could be very tough, always told me, "Remember, everyone you review has worked very hard and spent a lot of money to be able to give the performance you are hearing, so be respectful." Now,  in no way do I want to suggest that a critic should be an enabling voice for a musician who isn't quite "up to snuff," as you put it. But the general level of music-making in America is very high. The training at conservatories and universities has never been better. Obviously, the truly great performers are rare and miraculous. But it's amazing to me how seldom I hear performances of really sub-par quality. Yet, there is a larger issue here, as I see it. I do think that there has been too much emphasis in classical music on performance over content. In earlier centuries it was composers who towered over the field. Starting in the 20th century, though, virtuoso performers, especially superstar conductors, seemed to claim most of the attention and the power. I am as thrilled by a great violinist or a remarkable soprano as anyone else. Still, I think that balance has been lost and we must devote more attention to music itself. One of my mantras in writing about that challenge facing major orchestras is that American orchestras should think a little less about how they play and a little more about what they play and why they play it. The whole notion of the "Big Five" American orchestras has been questioned in recent decades, and that's fine by me. When I see a conductor who has galvanized an orchestra and its home city, like Esa-Pekka Salonen at the Los Angeles Philharmonic , I want to cheer, because the priorities seem so right. Salonen's programs are diverse and exciting, with lots of new and recent music. Audiences are energized. I think the musicians and music-lovers in Los Angeles are having far too much fun to care a bit about whether their orchestra, on a technical level, makes the cut of the top five, the top 10 or whatever. Sorry if I'm running on here. Your specific question about whether my background as a performing pianist makes me overly solicitous to pianists I review raises yet another aspect of this complex issue. Any experience and knowledge that gives a music critic insight into a performance or a composition seems a good thing. No? Because I have "been there" as a performer, and "I know how hard it is," does not mean that my job is to make excuses for a performance to my readers. But I do try to assess and describe each performance in a larger context. What is the performer trying to accomplish? I think I am better able to assess that because I know music from the inside. I am the last critic to play "gotcha" with a pianist who has a short memory lapse during a Beethoven sonata or a singer who cracks on a high note in Bellini . I would tend not even to mention such lapses, unless they seemed indicative of a larger problem, perhaps an indicator that the soprano is attempting a role that she is not ready for. Anyway, this is a complex issue and your question got to me, as you can probably tell by this long, earnest and discursive answer. All the best. Who Is Responsible for Educating Audiences? Q. Do the music institutions of our country, like symphony orchestras, opera companies, or arts centers that may have jazz programming, have a responsibility to educate the people (students and adults) in  the communities they perform in?  Is the quality of a great performance education enough?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   You saw Bernstein as a child, can you reflect on what that experience did for you?  In what ways can we promote access to great performances throughout this country? A. The music institutions in America have a major responsibility to educate the public, especially young people. Not only that, I think that individual musicians and small ensembles share this responsibility. And music critics should do their part as well. The feeling for classical music among the general public has indeed declined in the last 30 years or so. One cause of the problem has been written about quite a lot: for decades the public schools gutted arts programs. Though many school systems have reversed this trend in recent years, the damage has been done. Also classical music faces competition for the attention of young people in our increasingly noisy, wired, Web-driven, pop-culture-dominated society. The conductor Michael Tilson Thomas , a born teacher, has used children's concerts, video programs, an interactive Web site and more to turn the San Francisco Symphony into a music education powerhouse. But many American orchestras, opera companies and chamber ensembles have education and outreach programs. At The Times we try to bring attention to these efforts, but this is a hard story to cover, since in New York alone there are so many programs doing good work in the schools. In recent years the Juilliard School , in conjunction with Carnegie Hall and the New York City Public Schools, has set up an academy where gifted post-graduate performers are given training and performance opportunities. But these participants in the academy are also supervised as they spend time teaching music in the public schools. What they are learning is that it is not enough to be a terrific performer, that you must be able to connect with, entice and educate audiences. You also ask whether a great performance is in itself an educational experience. Is a great performance enough? This is a very important point. I have complete faith in the organic power of classical music. I am convinced that if neophytes could just put aside prejudices and go hear things — an orchestra at Carnegie Hall playing Stravinsky 's "Firebird" or Messiaen 's "Turangalila" Symphony, a great production of Britten 's "Peter Grimes" at the Metropolitan Opera with a great cast, or even a dynamic string quartet playing one of the Bartok works in an intimate chamber music hall — that people will respond to the music whatever their backgrounds. A concert is not an exam. You don't have to study and show up prepared. That said, I am in the business of educating people about music. So I do think informing yourself is important. Compare classical music to the theater. A good way to initiate young people into theater would be to bring them to a vibrant production of a Shakespeare play. After that, one hopes, the young initiates will want to find out more, find out why they were so affected. I am from a musically untrained family. So just raw experience was what got me started. And, yes, hearing Bernstein conduct music and reveal how it worked was transformational for me. On the other hand, I remember hearing "Aida" for the first time and having only the vaguest idea of what it was about. But the sheer sound of Leontyne Price 's voice, especially those ethereal high notes, just floating up to the family circle where I sat ... now that lingered with me, that was an education.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Why Does The Times Review the First Performance? Q. Why must music critics review the first performance of a concert, a recent example being the first performance of the "Lucia di Lammermoor" production at the Met last week?  In the first performance, very often the kinks have not been completely worked out,  and the reviews reflect this.  For instance ,  it was evident that Anna Netrebko had not  rehearsed with the orchestra.  The matinee performance we saw on Feb. 7 was stunning in every way, however.  Can't reviewers wait until at least the second performance to make a judgment? A. In many ways, as you suggest, it would be more telling, and fairer to the performers, especially in opera productions, to review the second or third performance, after the kinks are worked out and everyone has settled in. But there is a competing interest here, namely news. When Anna Netrebko appears for the first time in Donizetti 's "Lucia di Lammermoor" at the Met, that's big news, and readers are waiting to hear how things turned out. I don't think the Met or Ms. Netrebko or anyone involved would want us to take a pass on the first performance. Ideally, when there are problems on an opening night, we will try to get back to a production. For example, last season when either Deborah Voigt or Ben Heppner , who were supposed to appear in a six-performance run of "Tristan und Isolde," kept getting sick. Only for the final show did they sing together. And two seasons ago I went to Bartlett Sher 's lively new production of Rossini 's "Barber of Seville" four times during the course of the season, because I thought it would be fun, and interesting for readers, to see how the production changed when different singers took over the leading roles. Sometimes during the busy months of the season there are just too many other performances to cover. So we can't get back to something like "Lucia." But your point is well-taken. What Exactly Is 'Modern Opera'? Q. In the world of opera, there have been a number of new works in the past 10 years appearing on both stage and screen, from John Adams's "Doctor Atomic" and "The Flower Tree," Philip Glass's "In the Penal Colony " and "Galileo Galilei," Judith Weir's "A Night at the Chinese Opera," Damon Albarn's "Monkey King: Journey to the West," Stewart Wallace's "Bonesetter's Daughter," Robert Ashley's "Dust," Dan Plonsey's "Leave Me Alone!," Steven Sondheim's "Sweeney Todd: Demon Barber of Fleet Street" and Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich's "Repo! The Genetic Opera." The diversity is immense and yet is there a commonality to these operas, some thread that would include them all as being opera?  Or are there items on this list that you would not include as opera, and why? Ostensibly, my question is: What is modern opera?  Can it be defined?  If so, what might a modern definition be? A. What makes it hard to define "modern opera" is the elusive issue at the core of your question: categories in the arts. You are quite right that from looking at the list of fascinatingly diverse music theater works that you cite it would be very hard to figure out what goes where. What's an opera? A musical? An experimental theater piece? A dramatic oratorio? And so on. But all the arts wrestle with categories. You need look no further than Sunday night's Grammy Awards , where the sheer number of categories within each genre and sub-genre of popular music discombobulates me. And what, by the way, is "popular music"?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Classical music has always wrestled with categories. Look at opera in the 18th and 19th centuries. Serious operas are supposed to be sung through, we are told. Spoken dialog is a telltale sign that a piece is an operetta, right? Yet, there are profound operas, like Cherubini's "Médée," an opéra comique, and Beethoven 's "Fidelio," that have lots of spoken dialog. Mozart 's "Magic Flute" is another category-blurring work. That show was written for a sort of low-brow theater that mostly presented crowd-pleasing entertainments. Much of "The Magic Flute," which has spoken dialog, dumb comedy and magic, is very silly. Yet it is also one of Mozart's most sublimely spiritual works. So it's unfair to expect contemporary opera audiences, and critics, to figure out what work belongs in which category when this question has always been so elusive. And yet, categories are not meaningless. I once wrote an essay in which I tried to explain the difference, as I saw it, between a musical and an opera. Both genres mix words and music. But in a musical, words have a slight edge, words drive the music for the most part; whereas in an opera it's music that does the heavy lifting. This seemed a little more useful a distinction to me than musical complexity, which doesn't get you far. "The Most Happy Fella," by Frank Loesser , is more musically complex than many recent contemporary operas. Stephen Sondheim is another one who resists categorizing. He is no opera fan, and does not think of his works as operas. Yet, his musicals have been claimed and produced by opera companies everywhere, and understandably. In terms of musical sophistication, harmonic inventiveness, skillfully rendered large choral ensembles, and vocal lines that that give clarity and lift to words through ingenious settings, "Sweeney Todd" is a more accomplished work than the majority of operas from the last 40 years. So, I'm not sure we need a working definition of modern opera. Still, I think it is helpful for audiences, critics especially, to discern, as much as possible, what traditions, styles and genres the creators of a music theater work are drawing from. For example, it's helpful to know that the composer John Adams and the librettist Alice Goodman think of "The Death of Klinghoffer" as much as a kind of passion, in the manner of the Bach passions, as an opera. That perception helps you orient yourself to the long stretches of the piece that are dramatically static, but rich with reflective, psychologically complex ensembles for chorus and orchestra. At The Times, we often have trouble figuring out which critic should cover a production that bridges genres. Sometimes what determines this is the place that is presenting the piece. If "Sweeney Todd" plays in a Broadway theater, a theater critic covers it. If it plays at the New York City Opera , a classical music critic usually claims it. Sorry for the dodge, but this is a tough, and fascinating, question. What Makes Classical Music Classical? Q. What makes classical music classical? Seriously. I recognize it when I hear it but I don't know how to define it. How do you? A. I had a hunch that someone would ask this tough question, and you did, Brian. I'd refer you first to my answer to Chip Clark's question about categories in opera, especially modern opera. I found that question a bit easier to delve into because it was a little more focused. But the same issues and principles apply. And the same frustrations. You can't say that classical music is more serious that other kinds of music, or more complex, necessarily, or more substantive, and so on.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   At the end 2007, I tried addressing the question of what classical music is in an Arts & Leisure essay . One element I focused on was it's length. I don't think that Mahler 's "Resurrection" Symphony is more profound than the Beatles 's song "Eleanor Rigby." But the Mahler is a whole lot longer. Granted, there are short classical pieces. But for the most part, classical composers have been engaged with trying to write pieces that fill, inhabit, contain and activate relatively long spans of time. If you accept that as an organizing principle, then a whole lots of things about classical music, and what it needs to be, fall into place. I'm talking about structure, development, variation, complexity. Beethoven 's "Eroica" Symphony is a thrilling example of what I'm talking about. Every bit of that work, right though four long and quite contrasting movements, is generated from a few relatively simple motifs (not themes, but bits of themes and rhythmic figures and such) that Beethoven introduces at the start. So, with this addendum to my answer about modern opera, I think that's all I can see about the matter. With apologies to Chopin 's "Minute Waltz," most works of classical music are long. Preparing for a Review, and Other Matters Q. I'm so glad you are answering questions on "Talk to the Newsroom" this week. I always eagerly look forward to reading your reviews of notable classical music performances. How do you approach reviewing a performance, and do you change your approach depending on the type of performance? For instance, would you write a review of a one-time concert at Carnegie Hall differently from a review of a new opera at the Met, which is going to have many more performances? In the former case, you are reporting on a single concert, whereas in the latter you are giving guidance to future audiences. Do you find New York classical music to be "critic proof," or do your reviews affect ticket sales? Regarding an earlier answer you gave about Deborah Voight and Ben Heppner missing performances of "Tristan und Isolde" last season, how many performances of the opera did you end up attending? Do you think today's singers are hearty enough to endure the arduous performance schedules they have obligated themselves to? And finally, how do you prepare for a performance you're going to review? When you attend an opera or a concert, where do you usually sit? Do you take notes during the performance and intermissions, or do you write your reviews from memory? Do you ever discuss the performance with other audience members? (Now that your photo is prominently published on this page, I'm sure more people will start recognizing you.) How many concerts/operas do you usually attend in a week? Does it ever feel like "work" to you, or is the "work" limited to writing reviews and meeting deadlines (and answering online reader questions)? A. Well, Mark, this is certainly a comprehensive lists of questions about how I do my job. Let me take them one by one. You ask about how I prepare for reviewing something. In a way, my preparation is ongoing, a lifetime spent immersed in music. I bring that to everything I cover.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But I also have to inform myself as best I can about what I'm hearing, especially if it's a new artist or a new work. Yet, you have to be careful. I want to keep my mind open and my reactions fresh. I don't want to pre-set some response. Music criticism is a writer's job, and that's where the real work comes into it. A review is a mix of reactions and descriptions, part opinion piece and part news report. The mix is not necessarily 50-50. Sometimes I have a strong opinion. Sometimes I don't, so I stand back a bit and focus in my review on the news, describing what I heard. No matter the mix, the news reporter component of reviewing is crucial. When I review the premiere of a new symphonic work, or a new production of a Verdi opera, I have a big responsibility: I have to describe in the most vivid way I can what I heard and place it in the context of the news of the event. You are quite right that reviewing a one-time concert is different from reviewing the first night of an opera production. In the latter case, I am writing to readers who have the opportunity to attend the production and make up their own minds. Reviewing a one-time event, say a recital by a fine pianist, is harder in some ways, but also gratifying. Here a critic is contributing to an ongoing discussion in the field about that artist, or some repertory that artist has championed, or whatever other issue the performance calls attention to. Do my reviews sell tickets? I honesty try not to dwell on that too much. With artists and composers I am excited by, especially if I feel that they are not getting their due, I certainly hope that my enthusiasm and advocacy will make a difference. When I really don't like something, say a lame, clunky and clueless production of a Mozart opera, I do not think about actively discouraging people from going to it. I just try to describe it in a way that makes it sound as ridiculous as I found it to be. Your other questions are shop-keeping matters for a critic that can be answered pretty easily. There were six performances of "Tristan und Isolde" at the Met last season, and I heard four of them, including the first , the fifth and the sixth — when Deborah Voigt and Ben Heppner were both cold-free on the same night and finally did appear together. It was a glorious performance. Are today's signers "hearty enough," you ask, to endure the arduous performance schedules opera singers maintain? It's hard to generalize. Some are, some are not. But I do think that singers of the old school like Renata Tebaldi and Leonard Warren would have been horrified to see the jet-hopping schedules that some singers put themselves through these days. I sit wherever the concert hall or opera house officials want Times critics to sit. The seats are usually in the orchestra level and on the aisle. I do take notes, but just a few, just to jot down thoughts or a descriptive phrase that comes to me. If a printed score or manuscript for a new piece is available, I always accept it and usually follow it during the performance.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The number of events I cover per week varies with the season and the schedule. It can be as few as two and as many as four, usually no more than that. But there are also features, notebooks, essays, interviews and other longer pieces to write. I don't really like to discuss what I'm hearing with people before I write about it, but it doesn't actually hamper me if it happens. Finally, hearing a performance almost never feels like "work." As a musician and a music lover, there is always something interesting to focus on, even during a disappointing performance. And when something is truly exceptional, like Stephanie Blythe 's recent performance in Mark Morris 's production of Gluck's " Orfeo ed Euridice " at the Met, I feel lucky to have this job. Once in a while a really bad concert or some terrible opera production can be exasperating to endure. But even then I am on the job, trying to figure out how to describe what I'm experiencing. The "work" part comes in writing about the event. Thanks for being so interested. Opera in the Language of the Audience Q. Harkening back to your article, " So That's What the Fat Lady Sang ," do you think there is any possibility that opera performances will ever be in the language of the audience? I can remember singing in a performance of Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" on a Good Friday that was sung in English (a Robert Shaw translation) and it makes a difference both to the audience and to the singer. I can also recall singing in a performance of Barber 's "Prayers of Kirkegaard" and the final chorale only makes sense to the singer and audience in their own language. In English it's "Hold not our sins up against us, but hold us up against our sins ...." A. Thanks for this question, Terry. Supertitles, Met Titles , surtitles — whatever you choose to call them — are terrific. They've made opera vastly more accessible. There's no argument about that. But there is a tradeoff. Titles are distracting. You have to take you eyes off the singers for a moment, and I would argue that your ears temporarily migrate with your eyes while you are quick-reading a title. Still, titling systems are hugely popular and rightly so. Yet, I do hope that the honorable tradition of performing opera in the language of the audience does not disappear. It used to be common practice for operas to be translated. Verdi and Wagner would have been confounded by the idea that their operas would be performed in France or England and not translated into the languages of the audiences. I have wonderful memories of hearing operas in English, for example, a "Marriage of Figaro" at the New York City Opera with two young singers named Samuel Ramey and Catherine Malfitano as Figaro and Susanna. I sat in the fourth row, heard every word, laughed at every joke. It's true that opera singers are sometimes terrible at singing English clearly, even singers for whom English is their native tongue. But when you hear a singer with excellent diction, this is all the proof you need that it can be done! Another challenge is that many opera houses are too big to make it easy for words to be audible.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Still, I have had experiences like the ones you describe with the Bach passion and the Barber choral work. Once, at a Marilyn Horne Foundation gala concert in New York, some young singers performed songs from various countries all translated into English. The performances demonstrated both the challenges of translating poetic texts that have been set to music so carefully by composers, and the advantages when translations are done skillfully. One singer performed "Die Forelle" in English — "The Trout." Even though this may be Schubert 's best-known song, I noticed people all over the hall sitting up riveted as they heard the words in English. "So that's what it's about," they all seemed to be saying. The Struggles of City Opera Q. Wouldn't it help City Opera to find a new diva in Europe, either a soprano or tenor, and have them avoid the Met and devote their career to city opera like Beverly Sills? Just have them sing old warhorses that suit their voice. Q. If you were the new head man, what might you do that would help City Opera to survive and thrive? Thanks for your insights… Q. Why do you think that City Opera has struggled the way it has from a management standpoint for most of its history? Artistically, its contributions have been numerous to the field of opera, and provided a much-needed launching point for young singers from America and abroad, however, they have struggled with the overall management of the company. Why do you think this is the case? A. The number of questions that have come to me about the struggling New York City Opera shows how valued this company has become to opera-lovers and residents of New York. I have long believed that every performing arts institution, like every corporation, or service organization, or every major newspaper, for that matter, should be able to articulate and follow a distinctive mission. I think the New York City Opera has long had and followed a clearly stated and compelling mission, for which it deserves much credit. The company's directors over the years have essentially agreed about what the City Opera should be. Audiences may not hear major international singers and conductors at the City Opera, but they will hear committed, gifted artists, especially younger artists, who care about their craft and are eager to perform. City Opera has also been defined by its championing of American artists and American repertory. And it has an impressive record of presenting new operas and neglected works from the 20th century. Productions at the City Opera may not be as elaborate as those at the more prestigious international companies. But as a result, directors at the City Opera have been more ready to take risks and be theatrically innovative. Yet, even though the company has this clear and important mission, it has always struggled to distinguish itself from the Metropolitan Opera , a problem that was compounded in the mid-1960s, when the City Opera took up residence at Lincoln Center , literally in the shadow of the Met. It is a challenge for the company to convey to audiences that it is not some lesser Met, but a different kind of opera house with its own personality and purpose. The City Opera is struggling badly right now to right itself financially. Sadly, due to the economic meltdown, the company has lots of company, including the Met. The financial problems at the City Opera are far more serious, and some of them have been self-inflicted. I was in the minority of critics, it seemed, who supported the appointment of Gerard Mortier as director-designate. What he wanted to do was boldly, maybe dangerously innovative. But it seemed well worth a shot. I'm not convinced the City Opera board was fully supportive of Mortier's vision. On the other hand, Mr. Mortier, it now seems clear, had unrealistic assumptions about how much change the company was capable of withstanding and about how much money the board would be able to raise.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In any event, that's old history. George Steel has taken over, and though very green, he is full of ideas and determination. If I were in charge of the company  (and I can't balance a checkbook or even organize my desk, let alone run anything) I think I would convene the staff and the board and try to win everyone over to the idea that the City Opera has got to become smaller, more focused on its mission. New York can support two opera companies, but maybe not two that each offers nightly productions for months at a time during the season, sometimes with over-lapping repertory. Mr. Mortier's idea of running the City Opera according to the stagione system, that is, with essentially one production at a time, made a lot of sense to me. He envisioned City Opera offering a string of must-see and innovative events. For example, if the company mounted, say, Philip Glass 's "Einstein on the Beach," then all of the focus would be on that production and every curious theater-goer and music-lover in the New York area would feel compelled to see it. That was the idea, anyway. A star soprano or tenor devoted to the City Opera the way Beverly Sills was? That would certainly help things. But that would also put a lot of pressure on one artist. And the Met would always be able to tout more and bigger stars. Better to stick to the mission, I think, and present compelling works in vibrant productions that put an emphasis on ensemble effort. Opera buffs and insiders, as well as many critics everywhere have been offering City Opera free advice about what to do. Some of the advice is good. But such suggestions have to be weighed right now in the context of the dismaying national economy. George Steel is convinced that, with help and an energized board,  he can get the City Opera back on its feet next season. More power to him. A Word to Young Musicians Q. Times are difficult for young musicians, especially in this economy. Gigs can be few and far between, competitions can be cutthroat, and there's always the looming, dark shadow of doubt that can plague any musician, especially one with such a long road ahead. What would you say is the most crucial piece of advice a musician in his early 20s could receive, either personally or professionally? A. Thanks for writing to me, Andy. I take your question to heart and wish I could offer some real answers. Times have always been hard for young musicians, and right now things are hard for almost everybody. So I can imagine your frustration. First off, I'd say always remember how fortunate you are to be gifted and skilled enough to pursue a career in music. Still, I know how hard the struggle can be. Every time I hear someone talk about the long, difficult road to becoming a doctor — with medical school, residency, grueling hours, no sleep and more — I get very impatient. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a long tough road. But a medical student travels that road knowing that without question it will lead to an immediate place in the profession.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Contrast this with aspiring musicians, who go to school, take out loans, study and practice, and practice and practice, and do so without any certainly that this will lead to anything. Now that is really difficult. Yet, struggling young musicians have payoffs every single day, because they are doing something they love — making music. And that is special. Think of how many people are working securely in professions and jobs that they may like well enough, but hardly love. I have no glib advice for your current difficulties. But I have noticed one thing as I look back at my own career and the careers of my friends from music school days. The musicians I knew back then who have managed to have stable careers are not necessarily the ones who were the most talented or the most ambitious. They were the ones who seemed the most content being musicians. The pianist  always willing to play the first performance of a new chamber piece by a student composer,  happy to have a work-study job accompanying the students of a voice teacher, ready to learn the piano part to the Hindemith Tuba Sonata (which is hard, let me tell you) to help out a tuba player preparing a degree recital. Young musicians who have that kind of contentment with their work, even while struggling, tend to fare well, in my experience. Whereas I have known other young musicians, sometimes formidable talents, who unless they saw a path to Carnegie Hall and a touring career became so frustrated that the pleasure of being a musician went away. Some just gave up. But the other piece of advice, if I may, concerns keeping your options open. Today, we are told that the contours of careers in all fields are changing. Given the revolution in communications taking place right now, young people should get used to the idea that they may change careers during their professional lives. Having focus and determination can be tremendously important. Making up your mind that you are going to be a violinist, a teacher, an actor, a writer, no matter what, that kind of drive can get you through rough times. On the other hand, you don't want to be so rigidly focused that you miss out on something that beckons, something you might not have thought of. I am an excellent example of this career twist. As a young person, all I wanted was to be a pianist, play music and teach music in a college. I was doing all of that, and happy about it. But then, in my 30s, I lost my teaching job. While looking for other jobs, which were scarce, I had this idea that I could be a critic. I loved writing. And to me, being a critic was like being a teacher. So I approached The Boston Globe, and they tried me out. One thing led to another and here I am. The point is, if you had told me in my 20s that I would someday have the job I hold, I would have laughed. But looking back it makes complete sense that I wound up in this field. If I had been singularly focused on getting another teaching job, my career in criticism would never have happened.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Does this help at all? Keep in mind that you are very young. If by your 30s you are working successfully as a professional musician, you'll look back at your struggling 20s and have a good, though somewhat wistful, laugh. All the best, Andy. Critic Urged to Be More Critical Q. I am frequently dismayed by your non-critical support of contemporary music, no matter how unmusical a composition is. I have never read a critical remark that you have made about a contemporary work, although in some cases you have reserved judgment. Composers have come to believe that originality is necessary to be successful even at the expense of being musical. Many contemporary compositions are an assault on our hearing.  I would suggest that you write some articles about what is musical! and then base your reviews on the criteria you set. In my opinion, for something to be musical you have to be able to recognize patterns that repeat in one form or another, rhythmically, harmonically or melodiously. The harmony and rhythm can be all over the place, 12 tone, "Rite of Spring," etc. But there has to be patterns that are short enough for us to recognize — which are usually four- to six-bar intervals. The audiences are growing older. I run a 70-piece classical orchestra that has been in existence for 26 years and every concert brings in more and more gray hair, walkers and canes. These people hate contemporary music and would not attend a concert of such unless tricked into coming. In that case they would walk out before the end. There seems to be a transition now into minimalist music, which is easier on the ears than the stuff in the 1970s. The patterns are there but there are too many of the same patterns leading to boredom. Unfortunately we seem to be at a point in time where we lack composers with creative talent. No one is quite sure what conditions are conducive to having composers with great originality, but we are at an all time low. I do not think encouraging non-talent by writing glowing reviews is a good idea. If they do not have talent, your review will not make them any better — and most likely they will continue to compose the same old stuff. Please think about what is musical and write some articles in The New York Times about your thoughts. It will help you and those who read your reviews. A. Your comments, Mr. Ackerberg, which are quite critical of my work, are actually as interesting to me as some of the very positive comments I'm getting from readers. Still, I'm here to answer questions, not to solicit feedback about myself. So let me try to answer yours. First, though, may I say that I think you may have missed quite a few of my reviews if your impression is that I never write negative critiques of contemporary music. A couple of good examples come to mind, reviews I wrote of two new operas I heard in California in September: " The Bonesetter's Daughter " at the San Francisco Opera and " The Fly " at the Los Angeles Opera. I did not like either opera, and was quite critical of the work of both composers. I followed up those reviews with a front-page Arts & Leisure piece in which I explored the question of why so many new operas are so bad.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Yet, I admit that I try to be especially open-minded to new music. After all, new music is new, so we may not quite know what to make of it. Often I will find a new or recent work to be very intriguing, but also confounding. Rather than rushing to some thumbs-up-or-down judgment, what I do, and what I think is most helpful to readers, and to the field at large, is to explain as best I can what was intriguing and what was confounding about the piece.  Photo        Anthony Tommasini   Credit Earl Wilson/The New York Times    Also, I would never follow your suggestion by pre-determining what I think are the criteria of a good piece and then assessing what I am hearing according to that criteria. Imagine if you were teaching a short story workshop and young Franz Kafka showed up, with those very peculiar stories. Would you chide him for some assault on language, or perhaps consider that he might be on to something strange and new and fascinating? If I err on the side of being open-minded in reviewing a new work, that's O.K. by me. Let me add that I disagree with your proposition that for a contemporary piece to be "musical," as you put it (and what does that mean?) a listener must "be able to recognize patterns that repeat in one form or another, rhythmically, harmonically or melodiously."  In a way, of course, all music has passages with repetitive patterns. But often, especially in contemporary pieces, the patterns are vague, elusive, or even purposefully confusing — which can make the music either exasperating or riveting to listeners, depending upon one's tolerance for ambiguity. But it can take time for listeners to comprehend the "patterns" of a new piece. For proof of this you need only look at the way many critics reacted to some of the great masterpieces of music when those works were new. The Beethoven symphonies, for example. I'm sure you would say that the Beethoven Seventh Symphony is rich with recognizable patterns. But those patterns were not so apparent to a London critic in 1825 who described the music as full of "disagreeable eccentricity."

Regarding your aging concert-goers at the Massapequa Philharmonic Orchestra who hate contemporary music, I wonder if they also hate contemporary novels, films, plays and visual art. I bet they don't. Why are some people closed to contemporary music, so much more than to other arts? I think about that all the time. A self-selecting dynamic may be going on at your orchestra. If the programs offer only reassuringly familiar standard repertory work, then the concerts are bound to attract audiences who want to keep things that way. I'm sure there are other people, including younger people, in your community who might be more open to new work. In any event, these are complex issues, and I wish your orchestra well. Will New Operas Stand the Test of Time? Q. What a wonderful opportunity to ask questions! I'm here on the West Coast, and I visit San Francisco Opera on a regular basis. There, we see a lot of standard repertory, but over the years, there have been many new operas, and many world premieres, so, for instance, we've seen "Dead Man Walking," "Dangerous Liasons," "Dr. Atomic," "Appomattox," "The Bonesetter's Daughter," and that just scratches the surface. Do you think that any of these new works will have longevity in the operatic repertory? A. Hi Connie, and it's great to know that you are so interested in contemporary opera. Of course, predicting what operas will have longevity in the repertory is always hard to say. "Carmen" was a flop at its premiere. In 1853, a critic from Paris wrote that "Rigoletto" was clearly Verdi 's weakest work, that it "lacks melody," and has "hardly any chance to be kept in the repertoire." In addition, I'd argue that composers, producers and audiences should not worry too much about what new operas seem destined for a slot in the repertory. That they engage us today, if they do, is what matters. The gods of longevity will sort these things out for us. I have heard all of the new works you specifically ask about, and reviewed all but one of them. " Dead Man Walking " has dramatic sweep and urgency, but I find the music disappointing, rather melodramatic. But that opera has certainly has touched audiences and been produced everywhere. " Doctor Atomic " is not without flaws, I think. The second act may be too draggy. But it is a profound, shattering and humane work, and has an intricate, complex and hauntingly rich score by John Adams . So, if you ask me, I'd give "Doctor Atomic" more a chance for longevity than "Dead Man Walking." But who knows? And, as I said, in a way, who cares? In recent years many new operas have moved and fascinated me, among them:" The Tempest " by Thomas Ades , " L'Amour de Loin " by Kaija Saariaho , " The Handmaid's Tale " and " Kafka's Trial " by Poul Ruders, "The Greater Good" by Stephen Hartke, " The Death of Klinghoffer " by John Adams, all of which I reviewed. There are other new works I have admired greatly while recognizing that they may be flawed in certain ways, for example, Nicholas Maw's sensitive adaptation of " Sophie's Choice ," which I heard at Covent Garden in London. I have no idea about this opera's future prospects. But I'd sure like to hear it again. Thanks for the question. The Art of Interpreting a Composer's Intent Q. Is it more important for a performer (soloist, ensemble, orchestra, etc.) to follow a composer's stated or implicit artistic intent (Wagner and Bach come to mind), or may a performer use artistic judgment to "interpret" a piece of music when performing? A. Hi Matt. This is a central issue in classical music, but a hard one to discuss. Performers are interpretive artists. Their job is to execute and realize a composer's creation. That is their primary responsibility. But immediately the issue becomes complicated. What is a composer's "stated or implicit intent," as you put it? How do we know it? A musical score tells us only so much. A passage of fleet 16th-notes in a Mozart piano concerto may be notated precisely. But Mozart never expected a pianist to execute such a passage with absolutely strict rhythm. He trusted in the intuitive musicality of performers. What is on the page in a rhapsodic Chopin ballade, or a soulful Verdi aria, or a string quartet by Bartok is like a blueprint for the performance of the composer's imagination. So naturally performers bring their own perceptions, temperaments and intellects to their interpretations. And here is where things get controversial. When does a performer go too far and indulge his or her own feelings to the detriment of the composer's intentions? Somehow, I've found, people find this aesthetic question a lot easier to understand when they apply it to acting, especially when dealing with classic drama. Think of all the vastly different approaches to portraying Hamlet . Even looking just at English actors from the classic theater in the 20th century, Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud , both amazing Hamlets could not have been more different in their approaches. Then you have to consider actors like Aidan Quinn , whom I saw play the role in Chicago when he was young, just wonderfully, and Ethan Hawke , who was so compelling in that film adaptation a few years ago, a pared-down version of the play, mostly true to the original, though, but updated to modern-day New York. The question of honoring the Bard 's intentions versus bringing the character to life for contemporary audiences becomes very complex. In addition, styles and tastes change over time. I bet classic Shakespeaean actors from the late 19th century would strike us now as terrible hammy. Theater-goers today would probably find Sarah Bernhardt unwatchable. Yet if Bernhardt saw, say, Tobey Maguire on film, she would be utterly baffled by his self-containment. "But he's not doing anything!" you could imagine her saying. All of these points apply to performance in classical music. Pianists in the early decades of the 20th century played with more Romantic and interpretive freedom than is customary today. I tend to like the slightly cooler, more selfless and intellectual approaches of contemporary pianists. And yet, I love Martha Argerich , a stunningly brilliant pianist who will sometimes tear into pieces with a wildness bordering on the chaotic. Look at the range of reactions to the young virtuoso pianist Lang Lang . He could not be more popular. Yet some critics (I among them, for the most part) find his playing too attention-grabbing, self-indulgent and exaggeratedly expressive. Let me add just one more point. For all I have been saying about the inadequacies of notated music as a guide to the composer's intentions, there are many things in a score that are perfectly clear. For example, there is often a symmetry to melodic phrases in older music, as with the standard eight-measure phrase, subdivided into two half phrases of four measures each. But sometimes a composer like Schubert in a piano sonata will divide an eight-measure phrase asymmetrically, say, into subdivisions of five plus three measures. Now, a pianist simply can not ignore that. It would be like altering the rhythmic lengths of the lines of a poem. To ignore Schubert's phrasing would not be an interpretive choice. It would be a mistake, in my book. Whew. I do get going, don't I? Anyway, this is a terrific, but very big, question. Tips for the Budget-Conscious Music Lover Q. I too spent my early days hearing operas at the Met in standing room or "stehplatz" as it is called in Vienna.  Now I have a daughter attending college near New York City and would like to introduce her to concerts on a limited budget.  Can you tell me about the bargains available in the city for the sturdy student?  How much is standing room at the Met now?  How are your youthful haunts holding up? A. This is a topic I have addressed from time to time, but I'm happy to do so again because it's so important. I am really bothered when I hear classical music described as elitist and expensive. Yes, top seats at the Metropolitan Opera (excluding some of the premiere boxes) go for $295. But you can get a family circle seat for $15, and, though you are kind of far away up there, you have a clear, full view of the stage. Moreover, it's an open secret among Met regulars that the sound up there in the balcony and family circle may be the best in the house. Also, the Met has student discounts, rush seats and free dress rehearsals. Now, compare these prices to those for Broadway plays, big rock concerts, basketball games at Madison Square Garden, let alone top tickets (if you can get them) for the new baseball stadiums that will be opening in New York. (At the Met standing room is $15 in the family circle and $20 in the orchestra.) I maintain that there are more free or inexpensive classical music events in New York than there are in any other performing art. At the Juilliard School , the Manhattan School of Music and the Mannes College of Music alone you can hear recitals and chamber music concerts every day, all for free. You can take in an opera at Juilliard, and hear the singers of the future, for less than the cost of a movie. There are invaluable opportunities, like People's Symphony Concerts and the Schneider Concerts , where you can hear major musicians and ensembles at very affordable prices, mostly in the range of $10, as well as the Free for All at Town Hall series, where artists like the soprano Dawn Upshaw and the pianist Peter Serkin have performed for free. I hesitate to list the options here because there are too many and I don't want to leave any out. It takes a little homework to track down the opportunities in classical music. But you can get yourself on the Web sites of these schools, institutions and concert series easily. And I hope your daughter appreciates that her mother is doing her concert-searching for her. She's got a good mom. Can the Critic Still Enjoy the Music? Q. As I sat and listened to this past Saturday's performance of "Lucia" at the Met, which I thought was stunning, I thought of your recent review in which you took issue with certain elements of Ms. Netrebko's singing in the performance you had attended.  My question is whether, as a critic, it is difficult for you to set aside your critic's mind and to experience music directly without a filter? A. After many years of reviewing, I am amazed and pleased that I still find it quite easy to relax and simply take in what I am hearing. The musician and music lover in me has no trouble doing this. Still, the critic part of me does not turn off completely. While I'm listening fully to the music, one strand of my thoughts is engaged with thinking about what I'm hearing, and, especially, how I am going to describe it. I guess you could say the writer part of me never goes off duty, even when the musician part of me is being swept away by something amazing. Or dismayed by something terrible, whatever the case. Thanks. But What Does It Mean? Q. Greetings, Dr. Tommasini, I am a philosopher interested in meaning" — discovering the truths about life, love, goodness, beauty, and so on that works of art can contain or convey.  While I understand what it means for a novel or a poem to have a "meaning", I find myself usually very perplexed when historians of music or music critics speak about the "meaning" of a piece of music. I love listening to classical music, with Arvo Pärt being my favorite contemporary composer, but I often feel like I'm missing something when I simply enjoy the music rather than discerning a meaning or truth the music is trying to communicate.  What are your thoughts about meaning in music, and if you believe that music does communicate meaning, how does one learn to listen for it? A. You addressed me as "Dr. Tommasini." I do have a doctorate but I am seldom called "Dr." Certainly not by my editors, I can assure you. But it's very nice. Thanks. I gather that you are an academic philosopher, Jeffrey (if I may, call me Tony). Whew. The meaning of music. Before I tackle this one, let me challenge you just a bit. You say that you can understand the meaning of a novel but have much more difficulty doing so with a piece of classical music. Yet, do we really understand the "meaning" of a novel? I'm not so sure. I just read, for the first time, "Doctor Zhivago" and I loved it. But I'm not sure what it means. Nabokov was once asked what "Lolita" is about. You can imagine the potential answers to this question given the subject matter of the book. But Nabokov had the greatest answer, which (and don't quote me on this) was basically, "'Lolita' is about my love affair with the English language." Isn't that great? "Lolita" was his third novel in English. And I can imagine that he chose the subject, in part, maybe in large part, because it allowed him such freedom in exploring the sensual power of the English language. Anyway, many music critics, as you suggest, may write about the "meaning" of a piece, but I try to steer clear of such pronouncements. I think we love music intensely because it is the one art form that gives us a break from meaning. It moves us powerfully, elementally, viscerally, spiritually, but not specifically. We can turn off the part of our brain that needs to find meaning in things, and just bask in the non-verbal, hypnotic power of music. For someone who is in the philosophy business, as you are, always searching for meaning, I can see how music would be frustrating at times. But don't you want to embrace the chance music affords to let yourself feel, to let your perceptions kick in without having to label and define anything? Now, I'm talking about non-vocal music. Once you put music to words, either in a song or an opera, obviously the question of meaning comes front and center. Yet, think of the opening of Act Two of Beethoven 's "Fidelio," when Florestan, the political prisoner kept for two years in a secluded dungeon, pours out his ache and longing, his love for his wife, whom he fears he may never see again, in a wrenching, defiant and noble aria. During this scene the music may seem to have a clear meaning. Yet, to me there is the meaning of the story, the character and the moment, which do seem clear, and then the meaning of the music, which I still think has some degree of elusiveness. As to your question of how to learn to listen for meaning, I would say, don't even try. Listen for associative musical references and wondrous musical intricacies, listen for the musical meaning of a tectonic harmonic shift, an unexpected twist in a melodic line, and so forth. I bet that if I could sit down at the piano and point out to you some musical details about a passage in a Bach prelude or a Stravinsky piano suite, suddenly the music would seem to have a clearer meaning. But it would only seem so, I think. You would simply be hearing it better. At least that's my take on the subject. Is There a Biological Basic for Music Appreciation? Q. My father, a photo engraver who never attended high school, would listen to no radio station but WQXR.  Classical was the music of my childhood and has been my favorite music ever since, and I am 73. Yet, there are still composers I find I cannot seem to enjoy, among them Elgar, Bruckner, Mahler, R. Strauss, Wagner — I'll stop the sacrilege there. Of course, de gustibus ....  Yet, if I am not incorrect, my preference for B, B & Mozart, as well as for Verdi, Peter T., Stravinsky, Copland, and other composers with melodies easier to trace, is relatively more common. My question is this:  Do you believe that humans are generally more disposed to like certain melodies, rhythms, etc., than others, and, thus, the composers who employ those preferred elements? Of course, much of musical preference depends upon learning, much on open-mindedness and the willingness to work at learning better, much on familiarity ("Music for Strings, Percussion and Celeste" was so much better on the second hearing, and even better on the third). I'm also aware that raw intelligence, of whatever sort, plays a role. Yet, since I believe I am in a group more populous than that which prefers the composers I do not, I continue to wonder if there's something beyond those enumerated influences. I'll be satisfied if you believe that, no, it really is just a matter of  taste, learning, intelligence, etc.  But maybe you share my deduction that there may be more to it than that. A. I find it endearing, Francis, that you worry so much about why you don't respond to a number of composers who are supposed to be great. Actually, when you mention the composers you love, it's a pretty broad roster: Bach , Beethoven , Mozart , Verdi , Stravinsky , Bartok . Not bad. If you don't really like Strauss or Mahler or Wagner , so be it. There is plenty else to listen to. But clearly you are troubled by your lack of response to certain of the greats. It sounds like you are perfectly willing to acknowledge that you may be missing something, and that those who champion these composers do so with good reason. Which brings me to your specific question. No, I do not think that there are certain elements of music (a way of fashioning melody, the use of certain kinds of perky rhythms, or whatever) that touch off an innate, DNA-like response in all listeners. You know, when you undergo psychiatric counseling of any kind, you learn that not every quirk about yourself has to be accounted for. If the quirk is causing you no trouble, just let it be. In general, I'd say the same thing about one's preferences in music. Just go with them. In my college days, when I tried to get classmates who were ardent rock fans to listen to classical music, I found that different people had different immediate responses to different types of music. Some of the rockers thought that Baroque music was kind of neat, really propulsive. But they could not abide the emotive Romantic symphonists. Other rockers thought that Romantic pieces like Brahms 's First Symphony or Rachmaninoff 's Second Piano Concerto were thrilling, but that the Bach Brandenburgs were a lot of chugga-chugga, formulaic blather. Go figure. But (and you might have noticed that my answers so far tend to have a big "but" moment), as you suggest, learning something about music you think you don't like can often spark an epiphany. And I'm big on learning. By my late teens and early 20s I was a huge opera buff, except for Wagner, who was too weighty and ponderous for me. I mean, I recognized the harmonic richness of Wagner's music, but I had no patience with it. I hate to admit this, since I so strongly believe that people should trust their intuitive reactions to music, but a course I took as an undergraduate at Yale from a professor I had mixed feelings about really changed my mind. The course was History of 19th Century Music, and the professor was Robert Bailey, a distinguished Wagner scholar, who was brilliant, self-assured and utterly dogmatic. The first day of class he divided music from the 19th century into three periods: Pre-Wagner, Wagner, and Post-Wagner. This meant that Schubert was Pre-Wagner and Brahms was Post-Wagner. My beloved Verdi was mentioned one day only in passing, and with barely concealed disdain. Still, for the duration of that class I let myself be swayed by Professor Bailey's intense advocacy of Wagner. We particularly studied "Tristan und Isolde." It worked. I flipped out. I became a huge Wagner fan and I still am. I think the last 20 minutes of "Die Walküre" may be the most sublimely moving music ever written. Wagner was a nasty man. But as a composer, he transcended himself. Now, I don't give that Yale professor all the credit. By that point I was learning the Schoenberg piano music, so I was primed to appreciate Wagner. Yet, taking that course, with its absurd division of the 19th century, was a transforming experience. So, I bet that if you give "Die Walküre" another listen —  or Strauss's thrilling "Elektra," or Mahler's tender, elegant "Songs of a Wayfarer" —  you might be surprised. But if not, so what? Keep listening to Verdi, Copland and Stravinsky. And enjoy. Favorites, Rankings and Top 10 Lists Q. What are your top five favorite pieces of classical music?  Where can I get a good list of great classical music (not necessarily the most popular)?  I want to add more CDs to my music collection. Q. Who is your favorite composer? Why? If it's not Brahms, why not? Q. I recently purchased your book, "Opera: A Critic's Guide to the 100 Most Important Works and the Best Recordings" and have enjoyed it very much. Do you have a favorite piano repertory or composer?  What do you think of the Bartók piano concertos?  I am a fan of Bartók's, and always enjoy listening to piano concertos and the other piano works, as played by Peter Serkin and others. Q. I would be curious to know who your five favorite instrumentalists are that you would travel across the continent to hear (or would have, if they were still alive), along with the five composers whose work you can't live without, and why this is so if an easy characterization is possible. Q. I'm astonished no one has asked the desert island question: Who is your favorite composer and performer? Q. As you have the enviable job of listening to the greatest orchestras in the world in one of the greatest concert halls in the world, can you tell me who you believe are the top 10 greatest livingorchestral conductors in the world today? Q. I'm a somewhat new opera fan and revel in learning more about the art form and the most gifted artists. Can you tell me who you rate as the top five sopranos and the top five tenors in opera today? Q. Who would you consider the top five active conductors in the world today?  Also, what are the top five orchestras from the standpoint of technical competence? A. I am not really surprised that so many questions have come to me this week asking my opinions about who are the top conductors, the best pianists, my five favorite pieces, the composers today who will stand the test of time, the leading orchestras, and more. Almost all of the questions are expressed with a tone suggesting that the questioner knows, of course, that there is no such thing as, for example, the top five best conductors of all time. Still, it's fun to speculate and share preferences. If, say, a film critic I respected put out a list of the top 10 films, I wouldn't really buy it, but I'd be terribly interested to see it. Making sweeping pronouncements about the absolute greatness of an art work can be a provocative way to get people to pay attention. A writer friend of mine, Jon Garelick, has a great story about this. The professor of a college English class Jon took made a passing reference to "The Divine Comedy" and was met mostly with blank stares. "You don't know 'The Divine Comedy' by Dante?" the incredulous professor asked. "You know, Dante Alighieri ?" "Well," he said, "it's the greatest poem ever written, so you might want to look at it." Then he continued with his larger point. But the prodding worked. Jon and several of his classmates read it. Of course, there is no greatest poem ever written. You cannot rank artistic work, which is one reason I could never be a judge on a panel for a piano competition. I could listen to the pianists and absolutely say which ones impressed and moved me, and why. But I could never rank them in order of excellence: one, two, three, four, five. Playing the piano is not like swimming the 200-meter freestyle at the Olympics. Even at the Olympics, when the competition turns to events like figure skating, you can see the judges squirming as they justify the scores they award through a system of automatic point deductions for technical flaws and such. The truth is that a huge degree of subjective feeling goes into assessing figure skating, which is part sport, part dance. Still, there is a big difference between ranking art and stating your favorites. I'm perfectly happy to share my favorites. We all have favorites. Except for me, they keep changing. If I had to pick a favorite recording of Verdi 's "Falstaff," I think I'd go with Georg Solti 's account, starring Geraint Evans in the title role, the young Mirella Freni as Nannetta and the amazing Alfredo Kraus as Fenton. That's my favorite. Until I'm listening to Karajan 's fleet, enchanting version with Tito Gobbi as Falstaff, and then that's my favorite. Until I put on the Bernstein recording with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau . And then there's the classic Toscanini live recording. See what I mean? When some musical anniversary arrives and Times critics offer our collective recommendations of recordings , as we recently did with Mendelssohn , what comes through, I hope, is that these are just personal favorites, not a list of recordings ranked according to importance. We get great reactions to these features from readers. Often, pieces or artists become favorites of mine because I feel they have not gotten their due. I feel that way about Britten 's operatic adaptation of Shakespeare 's "Midsummer Night's Dream," which I find an astonishing masterpiece. Though the opera is very well-regarded, not many people seem to share my passion for it. So I have become like a protective parent about the work. One reader, Louise, who wrote me asking for for my top five favorite pieces, also wanted to expand her CD collection. Are there guides, she wanted to know, to essential and important works? Funny thing. It just so happens that Times Books, in conjunction with Henry Holt, has published a series called "The New York Times Essential Library." One book, by my colleague Allan Kozinn , focuses on classical music (orchestra works, chamber music, choral pieces, songs, piano works), and includes 100 original essays with recommendations of recordings. And then there is my book, which also came out in 2004, dealing with opera. I must admit I had to be persuaded by my editors to go along with the subtitle of the book: "A Critic's Guide to the 100 Most Important Works and the Best Recordings." I didn't  like the implication that there is such a thing as the 100 most important operas. But this is the kind of strong statement that gets people's attention, the publisher said (much like that professor referring to "The Divine Comedy"). And I absolutely stand by my choices. Probably 80 or so of those choices would be on any such list. Still, they are my choices, and the list includes lots of works, especially 20th-century works, that are especially important to me. Anyway, I recommend both books to Louise, the reader who asked for guidance in building up her CD collection. I like my book. It's one of my favorites! The Importance of Amateur Musicians Q. Thank you for your thoughtful answers to our questions, Tony. It seems to me that the classical scene is becoming increasingly driven by listeners more than performer-listeners.  In the book "Bowling Alone," for example, Robert Putnam writes that the number of households with a piano in the living room has steadily decreased since the mid-20th century, as passive forms of entertainment have become more pervasive. In such an environment, it is no wonder that many orchestras are driven by a need to adopt a "greatest hits" format.  Naturally, people want to hear great works, and works with which they are familiar.  In addition, given the multitude of high-quality classical recordings available, it is quite natural for a listener — especially one who has never been a performer, and so has less reason to have the empathy that you possess for a fellow musician — to reject any but the most perfect, recording-like performance of the most perfectly written music as worthy of his or her attention.  In short, we have a multitude of amateur critics and a dearth of amateur performers. I wonder about the long-term viability of new music, and indeed of classical music as a whole, in such a context.  Contemporary composers — not to mention contemporary critics — seem to be feeding into the problem of the passive classical fan by favoring works that even devoted amateur performers cannot play. So, finally, my question: What should contemporary composers and critics be doing, and be doing differently, to encourage a more participatory attitude to classical music? A. You raise several issues in this insightful note, Rob, both your comments and your question. There has been a steady and sad decline over decades, as you point out, in amateur music-making. There was a time when, if you wanted music in your everyday life, you had to make it yourself. Every home had a piano and family members who could play it, along with other family members and friends who could sing, play the clarinet, the violin, whatever. Then came the radio and the phonograph. Obviously, these electronic musical resources have been glorious advances in so many ways. It is now possible to hear recordings of virtually all the music ever written from around the world. And with an iPod you can have that music handy as you bop through your day. Moreover, it's certainly true that many musicians, myself included, were inspired by recordings. I remember, when I was a kid, listening over and over to Rudolf Serkin 's recording of Beethoven 's "Pathetique" Sonata, and then trying to play it just like him. Recordings also fed my passion for opera. Still, there is no substitute for direct involvement with music. One result of the the decline in amateur music-making, as you say, is that at concerts we have a "multitude of amateur critics and a dearth of amateur performers." Now, some composers argue that the family piano has been replaced by digital keyboards and synthesizers which kids keep in their rooms, where they create music all the time. But these nifty devices can still result in passivity: all you need do is select a rhythm track for your home-made rock tune and then pile up more tracks. Maybe I'm being patronizing here. But I don't think playing on your digital keyboard represents the same level of involvement for a young person as singing in a chorus and learning to read music. I understand, as you point out, that contemporary composers are particularly impacted by the decline of musical literacy, to call it that, among audiences. And you are right that in earlier eras composers, the great masters included, wrote lots of music for amateurs: songs, duos, easy piano pieces, symphonies and overtures arranged for four-hand piano, and more. One reason, of course, was that composers made good money from this work. But I'm sure they also found it satisfying to enrich the practice of amateur performance. Composers today must be much less inclined to write for amateurs. What would be the point, if so few people are able to play even easier works? Yet, I know from friends that collections of elementary and mid-level instrumental pieces, especially for guitar and for piano, are among the few things that publishers are actually interested in putting out. Arts education seems on a roll again. Things are changing. We now have a president who, at least during the campaign, spoke all the time about getting not just science and history, but music and art back into the public schools. Granted, President Obama has a daunting economic crisis to grapple with first. But musicians should at least take heart that he seems to understand the importance of what they do. A couple of years ago I wrote a cover story for "Arts & Leisure" about the most widely known amateur pianist in the world: Condoleezza Rice . Whatever anyone's take on her role in global events, that the secretary of state was a gifted amateur pianist who took time every week to play chamber music with friends struck me as a significant, even inspiring, arts story. In any event, composers and critics should keep the pressure on, get involved with the schools, anything to encourage amateur music-making. In my experience, once young people participate in, say, choral singing, it's something they want to do for life. Reviewing Opera as Theater Q. Reviewing opera involves an expertise that goes beyond what’s required when covering concert performances. To properly review an opera on stage, the music critic should also understand the arts of stage direction, set design, costume design and especially lighting design (which is rarely mentioned by opera critics, and without which the stage would be invisible). Most music critics, when reviewing opera, write little more about production than whether they found the blocking logical and the set designs attractive. They are not trained to look at stage production with skills equal to their musical knowledge. But production elements in opera deserve the same level of expert analysis as the musical presentation. A music critic reviewing opera must, of course, hear and understand how a vocal phrase or orchestral passage illuminates character.  But shouldn’t he or she be equally trained in the ways staging, light, costumes, props and blocking all succeed or fail at the same effect? How can opera critics be as professional in production analysis as they generally are in musical analysis? A. This is a good question and a fair point, Robert. Opera is a form of drama. But it’s a form of musical drama. Though story, text, character and, as you rightly argue, production values (sets, costumes, directorial concept, even visual arts) are crucial elements of the operatic experience, opera is driven by music and singing. Still, you are quite right that sometimes, in reviewing a new production of an opera I love, or the world premiere of an opera, I have strong reactions to the music, but less clear responses to the production. By this stage in my career as a critic (and after a lifetime as an opera buff), I’ve seen countless productions in opera houses around the world. So that alone gives me some background and experience to asses the staging. On balance, it makes complete sense that my editors send a music critic to cover, say, the new production of Verdi 's “Trovatore” that opens at the Metropolitan Opera on Monday night. You could argue that The New York Times should send two reviewers, a music critic to cover the music and a theater critic to cover the theatrical side of things. And Stephen Sondheim has made the same point from the other camp of musical drama. What gives theater critics the expertise to comment on the quality of music in one of his musicals? Again, this is a fair question. Yet, you can not separate drama from music in an opera. And since music rules in the opera house, I and my music critic colleagues should be the ones to review the shows. Similarly, since story, lyrics, book and character are so crucial to the genre of the musical, it makes sense for a theater critic to review a musical. Now, if one of my theater-critic colleagues wants to follow up my review of, say, “Il Trovatore” with comments on the production in some column, that’s fine by me. And I think our editors, mostly, would welcome it, just as I have sometimes written pieces about musicals on Broadway when some general topic or issue occurred to me. There have been those times when the editors in the culture department at The Times have sent two critics to cover something, especially when dance is a major component of the work. For example, Mark Morris ’s production for the Metropolitan Opera of Gluck’s “Orfeo ed Euridice” was as much a dance piece as an opera production. So I and Alastair Macaulay , our chief dance critic, both wrote reviews, which appeared side by side , each of us focusing on our area of expertise. Sometimes, if I have strong reactions to the musical performance of an opera and less strong ones about the production, I report on the music and step back a bit in describing the production. I try hard to make clear to readers what the show was like as a show, but I don't come down too strong with my take. But usually I have pretty strong feelings about productions as well. If I really love something, like Herbert Wernicke ’s enchanting staging of Strauss ’s “Frau Ohne Schatten” at the Met, or really dislike something, like Julie Taymor ’s busy, gimmicky, circus-show production of Mozart ’s “Magic Flute,” I am not at all shy in reporting my reactions. Guest Conductors at the Met Q. I think history may be very critical of the extent to which James Levine has near-monopolized the podium at the Metropolitan Opera. When I think of the presence of Toscanini, Walter, Beecham, Reiner, and other demi-deities in the time leading up to the Levine years, it always saddens me to remember that giants of the recent past — Solti, Giulini, Tennstedt, for example — were never given the chance to conduct at this greatest of all Western Hemisphere houses. Here are the questions: Is the current change — Maazel, Muti, Barenboim — largely the result of the Peter Gelb appointment? And do you think we will finally be able to enjoy the genius of Claudio Abbado, Bernard Haitink, Kurt Masur, Roger Norrington and Colin Davis before they leave us, not to mention the no-longer-young people like Simon Rattle, Michael Tilson Thomas and John Eliot Gardiner, as well as a Welser-Most debut or a lot more of Kent Nagano? Do you ever feel like writing about the absence of the really stellar conductors during a 20-years-or-so period of time? A. There was a period, as you suggest, when James Levine did seem to claim all the prominent assignments and monopolize the podium at the Metropolitan Opera . I’m referring to the 1980s and into the 1990s. But during those years he was fiercely engaged in building up the quality of the orchestra and the overall musical standards of the company. I don’t think you could say that during the last 15 years or so, he has been monopolizing things. And since he has been the music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra , he has devoted increasing energy and time to his work up there. I take the Met at its word that the difficulty of securing the services of the absolute top conductors comes down to scheduling. Riccardo Muti can bop into New York and easily conduct a couple of weeks of programs with the New York Philharmonic. But to conduct a string of performances of an opera at the Met, especially if it is a new production, involves a commitment that spans months. Granted, once the show opens, the conductor can come and go. But that still makes it very hard to conduct the scheduled performances of an opera at the Met while also working elsewhere. At the press conference to announce the new season, James Levine said that he was very proud of the roster of conductors coming to the Met next season, which include Valery Gergiev , Kirill Petrenko, Leonard Slatkin , Louis Langrée , James Conlon , Andrew Davis and, of course, Muti and Esa-Pekka Salonen . Is the influx of top conductors Peter Gelb ’s doing? I’m not sure. But I think it’s significant that Daniel Barenboim , who finally made his Met debut in November, was by then free of his gig with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra . And Esa-Pekka Salonen is making his Met debut in what will be his first season after leaving the Los Angeles Philharmonic . All the names you mention  — Claudio Abbado , Michael Tilson Thomas , Kent Nagano , Simon Rattle and more  — should somehow come to the Met. That would be thrilling. But I think this is more difficult to plan than you and I can imagine. Thanks, Dean Smith. What's So Great About Mozart? Q. I've been an amateur musician since the age of 8 and have listened to classical music since that time and often to the exclusion of other forms of music. Although I have played and listened to classical music for a lifetime there are many things I don't understand since I was not able to make music theory and appreciation a part of my post-high school education. My big question is what makes Mozart's music so great? I have been drawn to his music most of my life. I don't normally listen to opera, but I find his "Magic Flute" and most of his vocal music a joy to listen to. From my limited knowledge of music theory and harmony, his music seems to fall in to all the conventions of his time. So what is it that makes him outstanding? The feeling behind the notes? I often feel like I'm floating on air when I listen to his music.Or did he do something that at this point don't understand? Please enlighten me. A. Hi Drew, and first of all let me say it's great to hear from an active amateur musician. Keep it up. In responding to readers for this feature I seem to be drawn to the challenge of coming up with specific answers for cosmic questions, and yours — "What makes Mozart 's music so great?" — is certainly cosmic. Rather than engaging in a point-by-point analysis of Mozart's use of harmony, counterpoint, etc., I'd make a couple of general observations. There is one miraculous quality of Mozart's work, which seems the result, in part, of his populist inclinations. There may be ingenious strokes and astonishing subtleties in Mozart's music, but he seldom hits the listener over the head with them. Somehow, he deftly folds those enriching complexities into the textures of a piece, so as not to interfere with the surface charms, vibrancy and immediacy of the music. Mozart revealed his hand in a often-quoted letter from 1782, when he described three piano concertos he had almost finished (No. 11, 12 and 13), rather amiable and modest works. In the letter Mozart said that these concertos represented a "happy medium" between what is "too easy and too difficult." They are "brilliant, pleasing to the ear, and natural, without being vapid," he said. Here and there in the music, he added, are passages "from which connoisseurs alone can derive satisfaction," but these are written in a way "that the less learned cannot fail to be pleased, though without knowing why." This is a remarkably revealing statement. And the truth of it is borne out in countless Mozart works, the operas included. Think of the sextet in Act Three of "The Marriage of Figaro," when Figaro discovers that Marcellina is his mother and Bartolo his father, causing no end of complicated feelings — shock, relief, delight, jealousy — among the characters of the story. Musically that sextet is stunningly sophisticated. Yet, the pleasant music just bobs along innocuously, until Susanna arrives and wonders what on earth has happened. All the while the audience smiles and laughs. No one in the opera house need pay attention to the inner workings of that sextet. But, as Mozart said, his audience will derive pleasure, without knowing why. Now Mozart's ability to keep the complexities below the surface of his music has a down side. It's easy for a Mozart piece to sound unremarkable unless the performance is really good. A bad performance can not destroy a Beethoven symphony or sonata. Somehow, the architectonic greatness of the music comes through anyway. But a Mozart piano sonata can sound like a lot of tinkle-tinkle cuteness if it's not played with vitality and insight. I should add that there are those pieces where Mozart stopped worrying about the Everyman and really pushed complexity to the limits. Think of the "Jupiter " Symphony (especially the development section of the mind-boggling slow movement), or the six-string quartets he dedicated to Haydn , rich with ingenious contrapuntal writing and sophisticated use of thematic and motivic development. Finally, the other achievement that Mozart can claim almost singly is that he was at the very top of the pack both in opera and in instrumental music. Most of the great composers excelled in one or the other. If you don't count leading composers like Debussy , who mostly wrote instrumental works but left us one amazing opera, then the list of composers who thrived both in the opera house and the concert hall is small. I'd include Monteverdi , Handel (though he was primarily, let's face it, an opera guy), Britten , and you could probably add Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev . But as an opera composer Mozart is absolutely as important as Verdi and Wagner , and as a symphonic composer he is as central as Haydn, Beethoven and Brahms . That's pretty amazing! Arts Criticism in Smaller Communities Q. It seems  that arts coverage — particularly coverage of classical music — is in steep decline in news organizations around the country.  As a working musician in a mid-sized market, I am constantly trying to engage the editors of the local paper to pay more attention to us, in the form of preview pieces and/or reviews.  Two questions keep coming up: 1) Why should a paper cover the arts?   I would like to hear your thoughts on why criticism and coverage of the arts is important, and what role it plays in a community.   And 2) Who is qualified to write music criticism?  In a smaller community it frequently seems that  the people who have the musical background, writing skills and intellectual interest to write criticism are already involved with the performance in one way or another.  How can an editor go about finding (or developing) a music critic? I have enjoyed reading your thoughtful responses to these questions.  Thank you! A. Thanks for writing, Peter, and good luck with your essential work at the Pensacola Symphony . Yes, with all the challenges facing the newspaper business and journalism in general, a dismaying number of papers are cutting back coverage of the arts. I would argue that coverage of classical music, which is often considered dispensable, is especially crucial to the arts scene in a city like Pensacola. Citizens there can get reviews of major films from national magazines, journals, newspapers and television. But only local music critics can cover the important work being done by orchestras and ensembles in your city. The same goes for local dance companies and theaters. As to your specific questions, let me take the second one first: Who is qualified to write music criticism? When my mentor, the composer and critic Virgil Thomson , hired staffers and stringers to help him cover music when he was the chief critic at The Herald Tribune (1940-54), he mostly hired other composers, like Lou Harrison , Arthur Berger and Peggy Glanville-Hicks . Yet, Thomson emphasized repeatedly that music criticism is a writer's job. Extensive musical knowledge and experience will not help you much if you can't write about music in clear, readable English aimed at general readers. And there is nothing harder than describing music in words, that is, describing how a piece of music actually sounds without resorting to a vocabulary of technical terms that most people, even avid concert-goers, do not understand (things like chromatic harmony, portamento, and such). Let's say an editor at a Pensacola paper, or any paper, is forced to choose between two candidates for a music critic's job. One is a musicologist with vast knowledge whose writing is clear enough but a little dull. The other is an audiophile with no formal training in music, but a person with passion for music and an awesome collection of recordings. Yet, suppose that audiophile has interesting takes on things and is a very lively writer. Who would you choose? Any editor would go with the lively writer. Now ideally you want both, someone with deep knowledge who is also an engaging writer. But my story illustrates Thomson's point, to repeat, that music criticism is a writer's job. You ask how an editor can develop a music critic after finding one? By respecting the knowledge of the critic, but challenging the critic to keep it simple, don't just talk to insiders, write in a way that brings readers in, avoid jargon, take chances, have fun, be as respectful or irreverent as the occasion calls for. Now to your first question: Why is criticism and coverage of the arts important? What is the role of criticism? Well, not only do artists contribute to the cultural and social richness of their community, they makes news. A new ballet, a great concert at the symphony, an exceptional production of a play by Harold Pinter or a young new playwright — this is all news. A review is both an opinion column and a news report. But the most astute and simple defense of the role of the critic I know of came from (no surprise here) Virgil Thomson. So let me end this answer, and also conclude my week as the "Talk to the Newsroom" go-to guy, with a Thomson anecdote, which you can find in his 1966 autobiography. Virgil wrote that while traveling in Spain he was fascinated to see that it always took at least three children to play at bullfighting. One to be the bull, another to be the toreador, and a third to watch and shout "Olé!" "Music criticism is like that," he wrote.
