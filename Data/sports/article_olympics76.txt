New York is competing against Paris, London, Madrid and Moscow for the Games. The two major steps remaining in the process are visits to each city by an 11-member I.O.C. Evaluation Commission and a vote by the 122 members of the International Olympic Committee on July 6 in Singapore. The evaluation committee is to visit New York on Feb. 21-24. Details of the cities' final bids are to be revealed tomorrow, although much was already known from the preliminary bids and an earlier I.O.C. evaluation. Previous criticism of New York's bid was that it was too costly and complicated, and in the case of its stadium plans, controversial.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But Peter V. Ueberroth, chairman of the United States Olympic Committee, promoted the advantages of New York yesterday at a breakfast, sponsored by the Association for a Better New York, at the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan.

"There is no doubt in my mind that New York has produced a bid that can win." Ueberroth announced yesterday that Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and a longtime Olympic booster, would serve as the unpaid president and chief executive of the New York Olympics Organizing Committee if the city were selected. Doctoroff was named in a document signed by the City of New York, the State of New York, the State of New Jersey, Nassau County, the U.S.O.C. and NYC2012. Doctoroff is the founder of NYC2012. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the Games would add more than $12 billion to the economy and create more than 135,000 jobs. He is promoting a stadium as a necessity for Manhattan. New York is promising to build an Olympic stadium on the far West Side, with $800 million contributed by the Jets, who would own the stadium. The city would also create an Olympic Village in Queens, facing the East River and the United Nations; the site would provide new housing after the Games.

The document was printed in French and English, the official languages of the I.O.C. The bid packet for New York also included a number of maps and an attachment of about 1,500 pages that contained the required guarantees, licenses and contracts to assure the I.O.C. the city could hold the event.

Paris is widely considered the front-runner for the 2012 Games. It has twice been a host of the Summer Games (in 1900 and 1924) and has an Olympic stadium in place. Kevin B. Wamsley, a professor of history and the director of the International Center for Olympic Studies at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, said the I.O.C. vote on the 2010 Winter Olympics foretold a problem for New York in next year's vote. The I.O.C. bypassed a strong Austrian bid and awarded the 2010 Games to Vancouver, British Columbia. "That was a clear indication that they thought a European city should get the 2012 Summer Olympics, which they regard as more important," Wamsley said by telephone yesterday. Asked whether New York really had a chance, Wamsley said: "At this point I don't think so. I think Paris is probably a good bet. But stranger things have happened." Olympics are traditionally rotated among continents. By surviving into the later rounds of the I.O.C. vote next year, New York could pick up votes from supporters of European cities that are eliminated in earlier rounds and want to keep their own hopes alive for 2016. "If there is a way for New York to win, that's it," Wamsley said.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
