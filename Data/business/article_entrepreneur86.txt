Smiths 8,000-square-foot wine cellar holds more than 65,000 bottles.   Credit Thomas McDonald for The New York Times     LAKEVILLE, Conn. ALL wine collectors, no matter how small their hoards,  have cellar fantasies. Whether they keep wines in  hall closets, in  special coolers, at their parents’ houses or spilling out of basement corners, they harbor the dream of a cellar of their own. For the true believer, a collection is no mere cache of bottles but, even more than the eyes, a window into the soul. In the imagination a cellar is a sanctuary where the tactile act of communing with one’s bottles can border on the religious. For most people, of course, the wine cellar remains a fantasy. A select few maybe have achieved some portion of their dream, carving out a room to serve as their vinous retreat. But perhaps nobody has realized the vision in details so glorious as Park B. Smith, a textile entrepreneur who is also one of the world’s great wine collectors. In the limestone and shale beneath the weekend house that he and his wife, Linda, share in this little New England town in northwestern Connecticut, Mr. Smith has constructed a cellar of thousands of fantasies, covering almost 8,000 square feet and holding more than 65,000 bottles. As if that weren’t enough, more than half of Mr. Smith’s collection is in magnums, twice the size of normal bottles, and the count doesn’t include the 14,000 bottles auctioned off by Sotheby’s last November, which raised almost $5.33 million for his alma mater, the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. A cellar that size is no simple room. Mr. Smith’s is actually seven cellars built over 25 years or so and joined together, each more elaborate than the last. What began in 1978 as a small, claustrophobic root cellar has evolved into rooms with double-height ceilings and columns, filled with Asian art accumulated during his business  travels.  To fulfill the kid-in-a-candy store fantasy, Mr. Smith added to his domain a full kitchen and bath, and a comfortable dining room with a sound system, all enclosed in smoky glass to protect his guests from the 53-degree chill of the cellar.

Still lean with a head of straight white hair and surprisingly white teeth for a man devoted to red wine, Mr. Smith bears a passing resemblance to the actor Jason Robards, especially in his assertive, slightly raspy voice and no-nonsense diction. He’s a Jersey guy, born in Madison, a beer drinker who discovered wine while in the Marine Corps stationed at Camp Lejeune, N.C. “I went to buy a six-pack and the store had a promotion, Beaujolais for 99 cents a bottle,” he remembered. “So I bought one and tried it, and said, ‘This isn’t bad.’ ” Soon he was a civilian again, in the textile business, flying regularly to Asia and enjoying wine. By the early 1970s he was stopping on his way back in California, visiting wineries and befriending talented winemakers like Warren Winiarski of Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars and Dexter Ahlgren of Ahlgren Vineyard. The relationships he made seemed almost as important as the wines. “Something happens to people who love wine,” he said. “You really discover a camaraderie. It’s not like coin collecting or something cynical. It’s like sharing love in a glass.”  Photo        RETREAT Park B. Smith has a collection of Asian art and Châteauneuf-du-Pape in his wine cellar.   Credit Thomas McDonald for The New York Times    The wines that Mr. Smith essentially gave away in the Sotheby’s auction represent themselves a mind-boggling world-class collection: cases of La Tâche 1990 and 1985,  Richebourg 1990 and Montrachet 1985 from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti;  cases upon cases of first-growth Bordeaux, including one extraordinary lot of 50 cases of 1982 Mouton-Rothschild, which sold for $1,051,600; vertical collections of Harlan Estate and Araujo;  and hundreds of bottles of Mr. Smith’s beloved Châteauneuf-du-Pape,  especially   those from  superstar producers like Château  Rayas, Henri Bonneau, Domaine du Pegau and Château de Beaucastel. But don’t cry for Mr. Smith. It’s true that six cases of Château Margaux 1982 went in the auction, but he still has 12 cases left. Is it possible that Mr. Smith is a little excessive in his devotion? “When I like something, I get a little carried away,” he concedes.

It was a magnificent year, and those wines are beautiful now.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Early on, he realized the importance of getting to know the winemakers, and he has established close relationships with even the most reclusive of them, like Mr. Bonneau. As a result, Mr. Smith is able to buy in quantity wines that border on cult objects, like the 2000 vintage of Pegau’s Cuvée  Capo, a wine that the critic Robert M. Parker Jr., who Mr. Smith calls “my closest friend in life,” awarded 100 points. Mr. Smith has 135 magnums of the Capo, the equivalent of 22 cases, in addition to myriad regular bottles. It’s a good thing Mr. Smith is a generous soul with an enthusiasm for opening bottles. A visit to his cellar rarely ends without him opening at least a handful of rare treasures — the count reached 14 over the course of a long lunch for five people late in January. “Wine to me is an emotional thing — I’ve tried drinking alone but haven’t done too well,” he said. “A bottle of wine and a conversation with someone you like — wow!” He waved his hand over the glossy black dining table, littered with dozens of crystal glasses and the 14 bottles, including one Champagne; two 2003 Chave Hermitages, white and red;  and 11 Châteauneufs including Cuvée Capo ’03, ’00 and ’98; Bonneau Réserve des Célestins ’90 and ’89; Rayas ’90, ’89 and ’78; and Beaucastel ’66. “This is what I’m all about,” he said. Like even the smallest wine collector, Mr. Smith has had a problem outgrowing his storage space. By the time his fourth cellar was done, his first wife, Carol, who died  in 2002, asked him a question. “She said, ‘If you never buy another bottle of wine in your life, and you drink a bottle each night with dinner, how long would it take you to drink up all you have?’ ”  he recalled. “I said, ‘I don’t know, 25 or 30 years?’ She said, ‘Nope, 119 years!’ I said, ‘I got a problem.’ We decided to open a restaurant.” That restaurant, Veritas, opened in 1998 with an extravagant wine list largely based on the collections of Mr. Smith and another partner, Steve Verlin, whose holdings of Burgundy and Champagne dovetailed with Mr. Smith’s Châteauneufs, Bordeaux and California wines. But opening his collection to the Veritas clientele has by no means alleviated his storage challenge. “We’ve added three more cellars since Veritas, so it wasn’t quite the panacea we expected,” Mr. Smith said.
