There's a trailer truck with a flat on the Cross-Bronx Expressway, or the morning rush-hour commuters on the Long Island Expressway are backed up all the way to Douglaston. It happens all over America, and until now an application has never been necessary to participate. Merely be there, and you're in it. At hand, however, is an application for aggravation, an application for what looms as the only 16-day event at the Olympics in Los Angeles next summer: the traffic jam that is expected to snarl the freeways there. The application is disguised as an ''application for accreditation.'' Sent to members of the news media, it is a 32-page booklet of instructions, in English and French, plus 10 pages of answer sheets. It arrived in a yellow folder with the shaded stars of the Los Angeles Olympic symbol in the upper right-hand corner in gray and white, rather than the usual red, white and blue. The selection of gray by the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee was obviously a Freudian slip. Gray is the color of freeway pavement. Of course, it might be impossible during the Olympics to see the pavement, because of the traffic. But according to the ''greetings'' on the first page of the application, the traffic jam will at least be a family experience.

Perelman, assistant vice president for press operations, ''to welcome you, and all members of the media, as part of our Olympic Family. Your job is to report on the events of the Games of the XXIIIrd Olympiad to be held in Los Angeles July 28 to August 12, 1984. Our job is to assist you by providing all of the necessary facilities to complete your assignment.'' (Notice that the organizers have added a blob of California culture, putting ''rd'' after Roman numerals. That's like putting guacamole on pizza. In L.A., you can get guacamole on pizza.)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       But this Olympic Family will be different. On the application, the fourth question requests sex identification. Instead of two boxes marked ''male'' and ''female,'' they are marked ''a'' and ''b'' - whatever that may mean in California code. Perhaps ''amusing'' and ''beautiful.'' But in a traffic jam, perhaps ''angry'' and ''belligerent.'' The application makes no mention of the Olympic traffic jam, of course, despite the expected presence of 600,000 visitors over those 16 days, or about 275,000 on any given day. Friday, Aug. 3, and Saturday, Aug. 4, should be particularly interesting for anyone in an automobile on the freeways and streets near the main Olympic site on the University of Southern California campus. Athletics, alias track and field, will be on display in the Coliseum, boxing at the nearby Sports Arena and swimming at the adjacent, new U.S.C. Olympic Stadium. Both days, all three sports will be clustered in that area - 92,604 spectators at the Coliseum, 16,353 at the Sports Arena and 11,000 at the swimming stadium. For spectators there those two days, gold medals should be awarded for patience. Peter Uebberoth, the president of the Los Angeles organizers, has acknowledged that ''traffic is going to be a problem,'' but adds that ''it has been drastically overblown; people will get to the Olympics.'' Others, however, are not so optimistic. Comdr. William Rathburn of the Police Department warns, ''We can't rule out gridlock.'' Others envision ''America's largest parking lot'' and a ''demolition-derby'' atmosphere. In the application's ''transportation'' section, it's as if the freeways will be empty. ''The L.A.O.O.C.,'' it begins, ''will provide bus service to all sport venues during the competition period and to the Olympic Villages on the U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. campuses while they are open. We are confident that our media transport system will operate in a convenient and easy-to-use manner.''

After the chaos of the first few days had left many spectators stranded on the narrow roads in or near that Adirondack village, Gov. Hugh Carey had to supply additional buses. In Los Angeles, additional buses would only add to the problem, not alleviate it. Most of the traffic will be flowing to the track-and-field, swimming and boxing events in the U.S.C. area, to the gymnastics competition at Pauley Pavilion on the U.C.L.A. campus and to the basketball games at the Forum, not far from Los Angeles International Airport. Other Olympic sites will be scattered from Lake Casitas, near Santa Barbara about 100 miles north (rowing and canoeing), to San Diego, about 100 miles south (equestrian), to San Bernardino, about 40 miles east (shooting).

The application for the privilege of being stuck in this traffic jam must be accompanied by seven nights' prepayment for a variety of housing accommodations, from first-class hotel at $140 a room each night to student residences at $35 a room each night, double occupancy. For the duration of the 16-day traffic jam, no escape is possible for a media type - at least not without forfeiting payment for housing accommodations. ''There will be a required length of stay of 17 nights,'' the application decrees. ''Check-in is on July 27, check- out is August 13. If you wish to come earlier or stay later, this should be arranged in advance. There will be no refunds for stays less than that 17- night period.'' For media types willing to test their composure by driving autos, parking passes to the sites will be available at a price ranging from $195 for basketball down to $10 for modern pentathlon. ''The principal tool in accomplishing our purpose is information regarding your needs,'' the application reads. ''We have tried to anticipate all your needs and provide for them in this one document.'' But nowhere does the application mention helicopter rental.
