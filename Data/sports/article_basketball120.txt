And it’s not some exclusive private dining room or mahogany-lined boardroom. It’s Sitaras Fitness, which has quietly attracted the upper echelons of Wall Street as members, and in some cases as shareholders. The center is the brainchild of a bodybuilder, John Sitaras , 39, who along with measuring body fat and biceps has a way of sizing up egos, too. Sometimes, he even juggles the schedules of his 140-plus members to ensure that people who don’t get along in the corporate world are working out at different times. “He’s sort of a doctor of fitness,” says Jack Welch, the corporate legend who headed General Electric from 1981 to 2001. When Mr. Welch suffered a bacterial staph infection in 2009, he was holed up in the hospital for more than three months and had difficulty walking when he returned home to recover. He turned to Mr. Sitaras to help him get back on his feet.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, was never one to have time for — or interest in — gyms. But he was so impressed with the results that his son Alex, 26, got from Mr. Sitaras that he joined two years ago and now works out regularly. “My son benefited greatly — he lost a lot of weight,” Mr. Soros says. The senior Mr. Soros, now 81, goes to the gym twice a week. “It makes me feel better, more alert,” he says. Mr. Soros, in turn, referred Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, to the club. It’s Mr. Sitaras’s proprietary personal training program that separates his center from other high-end clubs. Under the program, clients must undergo six hours of mandatory tests, spread out over six visits, that measure the strength, flexibility and endurance of more than 35 major muscles and joints. The results are then entered into a software program that Mr. Sitaras designed. It uses more than 5,000 variables, he says, to draw up a personalized fitness program. All clients must commit to at least two personal training sessions a week. Each of their workouts is tracked and monitored, and the program is adjusted as fitness improves.

Credit Michael Falco for The New York Times    Mr. Sitaras also recently unveiled an advanced digital tracking room, which notes and evaluates each muscle’s capacity, improvement and weakness. “It’s very different from anything I’ve ever seen anywhere in the world,” says Fred Adler, the venture capitalist who scored home runs with Silicon Valley investments like Data General, Life Technologies and Daisy Systems. Mr. Adler, 86, is both a club member and a shareholder. Many Sitaras members are as competitive in the gym as they are in the business world. Bill Zabel, 75, a lawyer and founding partner of Schulte Roth & Zabel, long claimed the center’s record for holding the plank, an exercise that challenges the abdomen and back, and would sidle over to Mr. Sitaras whenever he was assessing a new client to see if his record had been broken, Mr. Sitaras recalls.

Mr. Robinson, 76, can leg-press 900 pounds, leaving fellow gym members in awe. “I wanted to do 1,000, but they wouldn’t let me,” he says. Mr. Sitaras recalls one member, whom he did not want to name, who used to snap his fingers, insisting that the background music be changed to classical when he arrived and demanding access to certain equipment immediately, even if someone else was using it. Members were shocked when Mr. Sitaras revoked his membership. “In their world, they’re at the center of their own universe, but when they come here, each one is not more important than the other, and everyone is on an even playing field,” he says. “It’s about managing personalities — big, big, strong personalities — and I want them to learn how to get along in the sandbox.” BORN in Chios, Greece, in 1972, Mr. Sitaras moved to the United States with his family when he was 3 months old; they eventually settled in Brooklyn. The son of the owner of a video store and restaurant, he grew up in a rough neighborhood, where, he recalled, gangs stole his bicycle out from under him, along with his money, at the age of 9. He remembers hearing gunshots outside his home at night as a teenager. Self-conscious about his 5-foot-11, 145-pound frame, he started bodybuilding at the age of 17. “I was really scrawny, and everyone used to make fun of me,” he recalls. “My brother used to call me Tiny Tim.” He was competing in bodybuilding within a year — and finished fourth in his first regional competition in 1992. Around the same time, he enrolled in Brooklyn College , where he took pre-med courses, including psychology and nutrition. But by 1993, he was short on cash and dropped out of school to focus on bodybuilding.

While he and his best friend, Boris Levitsky, were eating lunch outside a Brooklyn restaurant, the two were attacked by a local gang carrying bats, leaving Mr. Levitsky dead and Mr. Sitaras in a wheelchair for five months. “They hit the bat so many times that the bat broke,” he says. The attack threw Mr. Sitaras into a deep depression, worrying his friends and family. “That really messed him up for a long time,” recalls a longtime friend, Brian Spiegel, who used to wheel his friend outside, even in the rain, to get him out of the house.

(He appeared as an extra in a Jennifer Lopez music video.) But he soon returned to his first love.

He worked as an assistant for a physiotherapist, Dr. Norman Marcus in Manhattan, and then worked at local fitness clubs such as Sports Club/LA, Sparta, and Lift Fitness, where he built his clientele and reputation. Unhappy with what he called a cookie-cutter approach to fitness at many gyms, he developed his own system and, with only $17,000, embarked on a plan to open his own gym. “Within a short period of time, I had a really good following,” including some well-known Wall Street clients who spread the word among their friends, Mr. Sitaras says. He picked the brains of those financial clients for business advice — and received financing from them. Investors put in nearly $1.5 million, and the club opened in November 2007. “We were so impressed with John and his enthusiasm for having his own place that we worked with him,” says Mr. Robinson, one of Mr. Sitaras’s first shareholders. Mr. Robinson also invited some of his friends, including Mr. Welch, to become members. Another high-profile member is Jules B. Kroll , 69, the corporate security pioneer and bond rating chief. The center has also attracted heavy-hitters from the entertainment and sports worlds, like the music titan David Geffen and the Nascar champion Jimmie Johnson. Most members are highly driven and successful in their professional lives and enjoy working out with people who have similar traits, says Larry Neubauer, 45, a partner at the Quilvest private equity firm.

Credit Michael Falco for The New York Times    With so many alpha personalities and financial wizards in one space, it’s no surprise that wheeling and dealing goes on in the locker rooms and the gym’s outdoor lava rock garden. “You start talking, and someone will say let’s go outside for a chat, and this can lead to deals and things,” Mr. Adler says. Mr. Sitaras himself was the center of a major shareholder dispute in December 2008. Three of his nine board members, antsy about the economic downturn, wanted to make big changes at the club in order to increase membership and their returns. They started a proxy fight, trying to unseat Mr. Sitaras as C.E.O., dilute his 53 percent ownership stake and transform the gym into a more mainstream club. The three had brought in 17 of the club’s 79 members at that time, and threatened to take them away if their demands were not met, jeopardizing the club’s finances.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Other shareholders, including Mr. Adler, the venture capitalist, sided with Mr. Sitaras. Eventually the three dissidents were bought out. The center, which now has 144 members, skews male. Only 20 percent of its 140-plus members are women. Sandra Navidi, founder and chief executive of the financial consulting firm BeyondGlobal, joined in June 2011 after hearing about the club through Mr. Soros. Since joining, she says, “I go religiously — when I’m not traveling, I go every other day,” which is far different from her past experiences, when she’d enroll at a gym and then seldom go. The membership has a wide age range — 20s to 80s — though the highest proportion, about 40 percent, are in their 40s. Not everyone is accepted into the club. But fame and money aren’t the admission cards. Dedication to fitness is, says Mr. Sitaras, who performs all of the assessments personally. The club doesn’t charge big initiation and membership fees, the way many other upscale clubs do. The prestigious CORE club, for example, has a $30,000 initiation fee and a $10,000 annual membership, while the New York Athletic Club has an invitation-only $8,500 initiation fee and $3,030 annual fee. BUT many of those clubs offer far more than the fitness rooms, equipment and training that the Sitaras gym stresses. Benefits at other clubs may include pools, bowling alleys, golf simulators, basketball courts, aerobics classes, rock climbing, squash courts, massage rooms, yoga, Pilates, sauna, hair salons, lounges and restaurants, where members often spend more time socializing than they do working out. CORE even offers skin care and cultural events such as art exhibits. Sitaras charges no initiation fee; monthly fees are $150, and members must commit to at least two personal training sessions a week at $115 a pop, which means that total annual fees start at $13,760. Mr. Adler and Mr. Robinson see the potential for big long-term growth for the Sitaras club through several avenues. Those include the possible expansion of the center’s new digital tracking room into clubs in major cities across the country and the planned rollout of a software app that will let everyone — even nonmembers — gain access to the Sitaras program online, on mobile phones and on tablets for a monthly fee. “My goal is to make fitness accessible — not just for the rich and famous,” Mr. Sitaras says. “My goal is to help everyone.”   A version of this article appears in print on March 4, 2012, on Page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: Trying to Feel Like a Million Bucks, Too.
