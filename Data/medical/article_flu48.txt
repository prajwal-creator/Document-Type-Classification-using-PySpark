One has a nightclub with a chef who makes finger food. One has some movie star charisma and a case of the flu. O.K., let's go. Oh, wait. Shouldn't someone have the keys? It was around 10 p.m. on a pleasant evening in Manhattan, so the 15 or so guests who had gathered on East 83rd Street were not exactly surly. They were, however, pushing the bell and using their cellphones to call Josh Gaspero, a publishing entrepreneur who had been in a joint venture with Golden Books, who had invited them to his duplex, which seemed unoccupied. ''Shouldn't someone call Elaine's?'' one of the guests asked. ''Good idea,'' another answered. ''Are we sure this is the right address?'' a third wondered. Soon some young women approached bearing large foil pans. ''There's the food!'' a guest announced. At 10:10, a cab arrived and out stepped Steve Walter, wearing a purple shirt, a long crinkly pony tail and an earring. Together, he and the actor Chris Noth own the Cutting Room nightclub, where Phoebe Snow had just finished a sold-out show. The evening's party was in her honor. Mr. Noth, best known as Mr. Big on ''Sex and the City,'' had been at the show, but begged off the party because of a lingering flu bug. Mr. Walter, not too long ago a women's coat manufacturer (''There's no stores left to sell to, anyway'') and not the owner of the duplex, was the man with the keys. Still no sign of Mr. Gaspero, the evening's host.

Mr. Warner explained his theory of giving a party: finger foods. ''That way there are no plates to wash,'' he said. ''They just wash their hands.'' Essential, in fact, since there were no cocktail napkins either.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The menu comprised Provençal tomato tarts (i.e., small pizzas), seafood mosaic (um . . .?), chicken roulade with white truffle mousse and for dessert, two kinds of chocolate truffles: praline rolled in pistachios, and Cognac. All washed down with a lot of drink. ''If it weren't for my chef,'' Mr. Walter said, meaning Tom Bowes, who cooks at the Cutting Room and was busy arranging food on the platters, ''I'd be serving a seven-foot hero.'' Joe Passaro, another member of this guy pack, arrived fresh from playing percussion at the 6:30 performance of ''Beauty and the Beast.'' Ms. Snow walked in a bit later with some of her musicians and was greeted with warm applause. ''And we bought this town house for you,'' Beverly Camhe, a movie producer, said. At a party honoring a musician, musical tastes must be considered. In the well-decorated living room, guests were being treated to ''Riding With the King'' by B. B. King and Eric Clapton. In the kitchen, May Pang (the young woman Yoko Ono picked to be John Lennon's mistress when she was having doubts about their marriage) was discussing music with Roger Friedman, a gossip columnist for the Web news site Fox.com. ''Did you know that Bruce and Patty Springsteen sent the white flowers that were sitting on the piano tonight?'' he asked. (And asked and asked, all night long.) ''They're very normal people,'' he said.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Pennebaker sat on a sofa near his wife, Chris; the two had filmed Ms. Snow at the Cutting Room. ''When I was a kid we used to do this all the time,'' he said, ''go to a party not knowing the host, and never meeting the host.'' Just then, 11:30, Mr. Gaspero walked in with a friend, Susan Mitchell. ''First we had this First Communion in Queens,'' he said without apology. ''And then we had to go to have dinner at Nobu. Anyone want to see the house?'' A dozen or so remaining guests were shown up the stairs, lined with masks from Asia, Africa and South America. Mr. Gaspero -- the kind of man fortunate enough to say ''BARTH-e-lona,'' to talk about his ''thousand-year-old house in Italy,'' to show off something ''Ruthie gave me from Israel'' (Dr. Ruth, that is), to have a Pachinko machine in his bedroom -- was eager to discuss his impending 60th birthday. He has invited 200 people to that house in Italy in June to celebrate. ''I invited 50 couples down the Nile for my 50th birthday,'' he said. ''There were 98 happy people on that boat, and one unhappy one -- me. I just broke up.'' Mr. Gaspero, divorced before that trip, is still single. ''I'm a serial monogamist,'' he said.

Was it someone wondering if the party was still on? ''No,'' Mr. Gaspero told Ms. Mitchell. ''It's probably one of my ex-girlfriends.'' He rattled off a couple of possible names. Should anyone answer it? The question hung in the air, and then some grappa was poured.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
