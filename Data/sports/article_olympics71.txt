In other highlights, Jeremy Wariner, the reigning world and Olympic champion in the men’s 400 meters, defeated LaShawn Merritt in a dramatic stretch run, outleaning his rival to win by a hundredth of a second in 44.36. And Oscar Pistorius , the double amputee sprinter from South Africa, sliced more than a second from his time from last week in his attempt to meet the Olympic qualifying standard in the 400. Isinbayeva cleared the record height with ease on her second attempt, nearly three years after setting her previous record, 16-5 1/4, at the world championships in Helsinki, Finland.

And I think that’s the thing that got me the victory. I finally executed like I should have at trials.”  Photo        Oscar Pistorius, left, failed to meet the Olympic qualifying standard in the 400 on Friday.

Last week in Milan, in his first race against able-bodied athletes in nearly a year, Pistorius ran a 47.78. His best is 46.36. “I felt this race was awesome, but I can still improve,” he said Friday. “After last week’s race in Milan I was really worried, and I was very nervous going in tonight.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The court overturned a decision by the International Association of Athletics Federations that Pistorius’s carbon-fiber prosthetics gave him an unfair advantage. Pistorius may make perhaps his final attempt at qualifying Wednesday in Lucerne, Switzerland. Also Friday, Asafa Powell of Jamaica, the former world-record holder in the 100 meters, pulled up with a groin strain in his 100 heat.
