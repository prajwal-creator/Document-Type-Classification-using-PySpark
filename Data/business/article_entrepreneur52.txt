Credit Andrew Testa for The New York Times     PETER COCHRANE, a technology consultant, entrepreneur and blogger, usually unwinds on the train between his home in Ipswich, England, and London with coffee, cookies and a newspaper. But during a memorable trip in March 2006, neighboring passengers disturbed his relaxation rituals by behaving in a very un-British manner: They were loud. The English might sing at soccer stadiums, but they usually keep quiet on British Rail. Mr. Cochrane shot his noisy neighbors a cold stare. No luck. So he decided that if he couldn’t beat them, he would join them. He then began actively listening to the consultants across the aisle conduct a mobile business meeting. “Within a matter of minutes, I know who they are. I know who their client is. What kind of business they’re in. I know what the turnover is,” said Mr. Cochrane. “And I know what kind of difficulties they are having.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The consultant in charge then announced an imminent conference call with a client. “The number to dial in is this and the passcode is this,” said Mr. Cochrane, who “couldn’t resist” dialing into the conference call as well. He entered the overheard passcode and covertly monitored the conversation among his seatmates and a publicly held aerospace company. “If I had been a bad boy,” said Mr. Cochrane, “I could have undoubtedly made some profit.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Blabbing on a business trip can cause repercussions. In 2009, Robert B. Robbins, a partner in the Washington office of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, unwittingly broadcast his law firm’s intention to lay off several associates to fellow Amtrak passengers. In a cellphone call, the lawyer named co-workers facing unemployment. The indiscretion mortified a law student on the train, who alerted the blog Above the Law. News of the gaffe prompted Mr. Robbins’s law firm to publicly apologize “for the unfortunate manner in which our deliberations about reductions have become public.” Mr. Robbins kept his job but got a new nickname: Acela Bob. In an age of hyperconnectivity, when several airlines offer in-flight cellphone service and an increasing number of buses, trains and even taxis now provide Wi-Fi access, business travelers routinely expose proprietary information. “People are woefully lax” about information security practices, said Cynthia Cheng Correia, who teaches a course at Simmons College in Boston on competitive intelligence, which is the legal and ethical monitoring of business or professional rivals. Ms. Cheng Correia pointed out that you could give away the store without saying a word. On one flight, she sat next to a sales manager working on a database marked “clients.” Ms. Cheng Correia happened to be reviewing photos on her cellphone at the time and could have snapped a shot of her neighbor’s computer screen. “He would not have been the wiser,” she said. Shoulder surfing , or surreptitiously reading a stranger’s documents or laptop, is widespread. In a 2007 survey of 400 business people commissioned by 3M United Kingdom, 80 percent shoulder-surfed. Still, when they were the subjects of such unwanted attention, more than half of respondents said they had just ignored it. Ms. Cheng Correia suggested that the casual appearance of seatmates often lulls business travelers into a false sense of security. “We can’t say we’re safe just because we’re surrounded by crying babies,” she said, adding that first-class snoops often lurk in coach: “There are more eyeballs in coach than in first class or business class.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Richard Plansky, senior managing director for business intelligence and investigations at Kroll in New York City, advises travelers concerned with shoulder surfing to go on a “data diet” before a business trip. “Do you really need to bring a laptop, and an iPhone and a USB drive?” Mr. Plansky asked. He warns clients traveling to China or Russia that the answer should be no. Corporate security experts accuse state security operatives in both countries of trying to steal trade secrets from visiting business travelers. He counsels clients traveling to high-risk countries to carry laptops and cellphones devoid of valuable information. “You can’t lose what you don’t have,” said Mr. Plansky. Ken Rygler, a consultant in the microelectronics industry, worries more about the prying eyes of curious seatmates than Chinese intelligence agents. During flights, he avoids using PowerPoint “because the font is so big.” Mr. Rygler sometimes snoops on neighboring passengers, especially on flights linking high-tech hubs. He recalled digging up interesting information on a flight between Austin, Tex., and San Jose, Calif. Mr. Rygler learned that one of his client’s competitors had struggled with a problem at its factory. “It was not public,” said Mr. Rygler. “It was helpful.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Plansky of Kroll dismissed such methods as inefficient, though he said he considered conferences and trade shows “particularly risky” destinations for travelers with intellectual property to protect. Leonard Fuld of the firm Fuld & Company in Cambridge, Mass., stressed that competitive intelligence professionals had more in common with librarians than spies, but he acknowledged that an eavesdropping expedition near a conference center could prove valuable. “You draw concentric circles around the location of the trade show or conference. You know the restaurants and hotels around the conference will have people filled to the brim that are attending the show. That could be useful,” said Mr. Fuld. Some conference attendees are easy marks. They wear name tags outside conference centers and clothing emblazoned with corporate logos. And employees of large companies could find it tempting to talk shop at industry events because they might see only co-workers from other offices at conventions. Disclosures would not surprise Robert D. Brownstone, a lawyer at Fenwick & West in Mountain View, Calif., who frequently lectures about information security at conferences.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   He recalled that before a speech at an employment law conference in Florida, he used a computer reserved for registrants. A Microsoft Word file entitled “ Severance.do c” was on the desktop. “Just by hovering on the icon on the desktop, a yellow bubble came up with the name of the law firm,” said Mr. Brownstone. “I opened it up and saw a final or prior draft of a severance agreement. Here’s someone at a conference, learning to be a better employment lawyer and they obviously went into their work e-mail or their computer and dropped something onto the drive and left it sitting there.” On the road, Mr. Brownstone adheres to a strict protocol to protect confidential information. He uses a software program, Better File Rename, to make documents seem innocuous, and carries a portable scanner to digitize documents. “I just don’t want to have stuff that anybody could eyeball,” said Mr. Brownstone. He also avoids speaking on his cellphone with clients when traveling. “I’ve been a lawyer 25 years; I can only remember one phone call with a client.” If he speaks with colleagues outside the office, Mr. Brownstone practices what might be called verbal encryption. He recalled working in New York City in the 1980s and 1990s on prominent cases like the defense of Michael R. Milken, who was eventually convicted of securities fraud, and the civil case filed against Claus von Bulow by his stepchildren. “If we were going to court, the senior partner and I would be hopping in a cab to go to the federal courthouse,” said Mr. Brownstone. “We would use code names for the key players in the case. You don’t know who the cabdriver just drove or is about to drive.” Mr. Brownstone sheepishly admits that he fails to use a privacy filter on his laptop. “Shame on me,” he said. He is not alone. A 2010 survey by the software security company People Security of 800 attendees of an information technology conference found that only 13 percent used screen shields, which block the sideways view of curious onlookers without diminishing the user’s view. There may be physiological and psychological reasons airline passengers leak information. In the analysis of Robert Bor, an aviation psychologist and the editor of a book called “Passenger Behaviour,” (Ashgate, 2003) some travelers experience in-flight anxiety when away from familiar settings. “That anxiety can make us more susceptible to engaging with people,” said Mr. Bor. Airline passengers, he said, often suffer from fatigue, jet lag, low blood sugar from not having eaten or hypoxia, which is mild oxygen deprivation. “Being at 35,000 feet for more than two hours is going to make you mildly hypoxic,” said Mr. Bor, “and slightly less oxygen will make you euphoric or may give slightly poorer judgment.” Given the emotional and physical stresses, Mr. Bor judged commercial airlines as the perfect environment to turn a frequent flier into a chatterbox. Before breaking out the BlackBerry or yammering to a co-worker — whether in the skies or on the rails — consider the burden placed on the professional listener who may be minding your business from the next seat.
