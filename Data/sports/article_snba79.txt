TREASTER    Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story                 View page in TimesMachine        , Page 001001 The New York Times Archives    The fee was $150 and for that, the police said yesterday, two teen-agers -- one 16, the other 18 -- gunned down an accountant who had uncovered discrepancies of $80,000 to $100,000 in the books of a Bronx drug-treatment agency. "It was a contract killing," said Detective Kim Royster, a spokeswoman for the Police Department. Deputy Chief Edward Cappello, the chief of detectives in the Bronx, said the teen-agers had never met their victim, Lillian DeJesus, 52, a woman who friends said loved cooking and the opera and who was very religious. The police suspect that someone in the middle or upper reaches of the drug agency, Promesa, hired the teen-agers and pointed out -- or had someone else point out -- Ms. DeJesus as she left her office at Boston Road and 179th Street toward dusk three weeks ago with two colleagues. "The contract is coming from Promesa," Chief Cappello said in an interview yesterday. He said the teen-agers had received a total of $150, though they may have been promised they would get more later.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Rivera and Wayne Haywood, the 18-year-old, wore hooded ski jackets and sullen expressions as they were led out of the 48th Precinct station house in the Tremont section of the Bronx yesterday. They were picked up on Thursday afternoon, Chief Cappello said, as they were hanging out near 138th Street and St. Ann's Avenue in the South Bronx. The police had seized piles of records at Promesa, which stands for Puerto Rican Organization to Motivate, Enlighten and Serve Addicts, and questioned the staff. But the chief said they were led to the teen-agers "through people in the neighborhood" in the South Bronx where they often spent time. At a fourth-floor apartment at 537 East 139th Street in the Mott Haven section, which the police said was Mr. Rivera's address, the young man's grandmother, Mildred Arce, burst into tears when reporters told of the arrest. Ms. Arce, who said she had come to New York from Puerto Rico 23 years ago, showed a photograph of Mr. Rivera in cap and gown as he graduated from Intermediate School 139 last June and a sheaf of certificates for classroom excellence and athletics. Ms. Arce and a neighbor, Celia Ortiz, said they found it hard to believe the boy had been charged with murder. "It's a mistake, a very big mistake," said Ms. Ortiz. "It's probably somebody that looks like him," she said. "But not my little Jeffrey." The police said that Mr. Haywood lived at 1668 Davidson Avenue, also in the Bronx. But residents of the apartment building there said they did not know anyone by that name. Chief Cappello said the police were continuing to question suspects and that he expected more arrests. He said investigators believed that at least two others were involved, a go-between who hired the teen-agers and paid them -- $100 for one boy and $50 for the second -- and someone at Promesa who felt threatened by Ms. DeJesus's discoveries. No Comment From Agency   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Felix Velazquez, the executive director of Promesa, which provides drug rehabilitation for about 460 men and women, refused to talk with a reporter but referred questions, through a secretary, to George C. Shea, a partner in a Manhattan public relations firm. As to who might have ordered the killing, Mr. Shea said that Mr. Velazquez "has no information on that at all." Mr. Shea continued, "He is not commenting on the details of the case until it is sort of wrapped up."

Richard Chady, a spokesman for the State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services, which oversees all drug and alcohol treatment programs in New York, said that state auditors had challenged nearly $300,000 in operating expenses over two years at Promesa, which has an annual budget of $6 million, and had been negotiating a settlement through Ms. DeJesus. Mr. Chady said that, as far as the audits went, "I don't think any criminal wrongdoing was suspected." "There had been no referral to the authorities for any criminal prosecution," Mr. Chady said. Embezzlement Suspected Chief Cappello, however, said that the police had been concentrating on a sum of $80,000 to $100,000 that they believed had been embezzled through a process by which an employee wrote checks to another person. It was not immediately clear why the police had not yet arrested the suspected check writer, and Chief Cappello turned away further questions. Chief Cappello said Ms. DeJesus had been "in the process of preparing a report on this matter" of the $80,000 to $100,000 "when she was killed." Ms. DeJesus, a graduate of Bernard Baruch College in Manhattan, had taken the job as chief financial officer of Promesa in August, after nearly 20 years of accounting work.

A month before her death, the police said, someone fired a shot at Ms. DeJesus as she left work. Chief Cappello said investigators suspected that shooting was the work of the same plotters who finally succeeded. But he said they had yet to find evidence to prove that theory, nor was it clear whether the same gunmen were involved in both shootings. About two weeks after Ms. DeJesus's death, Mr. Chady said that the state drug and alcohol office learned in June that New York's Secretary of State had canceled Promesa's status as a charitable organization for failing to file an annual financial report for 1992. As a result, he said, the drug and alcohol office stopped providing increments of the $2.5 million that it had been giving as a little more than a third of Promesa's annual operating budget. Mr. Chady said he did not know why the financial report had not been submitted. But Mr. Shea, speaking for Promesa's executive director, said "the reason it has been canceled is a technical issue pending completion of some audits." "And," he added, "the issue is expected to be resolved in the near future."    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
