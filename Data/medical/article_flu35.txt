Questions may be e-mailed to askthetimes@nytimes.com . Most recent answer: click here . Mr. Chan is the  bureau chief of the blog, which began publication in June 2007 and is a forum for breaking news updates, feature articles and reader conversations.  Among the many topics that the blog has covered are the emergency landing of Flight 1549 in the Hudson River;  the recent M.T.A. fare increase and service cuts ; popular baby names ; bicycle racks ; the history of Jewish delis ; and the city's dog-scooping law . City Room was also part of The Times's coverage of the scandal that prompted Eliot Spitzer to resign as governor of New York, for which the newspaper was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news last week. Mr. Chan, whose career has included reporting for The Washington Post and assignments for The Times in City Hall and on the transportation beat, is a native of New York City. He coordinates City Room coverage with a team of editors and reporters, who will be assisting him with questions this week. Other Times staff members have answered questions in this column, including Executive Editor Bill Keller, Managing Editor Jill Abramson, Managing Editor John Geddes, Assistant Managing Editor Richard L. Berke, Assistant Managing Editor Glenn Kramon, Associate Managing Editor Charles Strum, Obituaries Editor Bill McDonald, Metropolitan Editor Joe Sexton, Living Editor Trish Hall, Investigations Editor Matthew Purdy, Foreign Editor Susan Chira, National Editor Suzanne Daley, Sports Editor Tom Jolly and Culture Editor Sam Sifton. Their responses and those of other Times editors are on the Talk to the Newsroom page .

How the Blog Relates to the Newspaper  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Q. What is the nature and scope of the relationship between City Room and The New York Times? A. City Room uses original reporting, writing and photography of New York Times journalists and is produced under the direction of the metropolitan desk's editors. There is a strong relationship between the blog and the rest of The Times, particularly the New York report . The blog is often a vehicle for fast-breaking news that is eventually incorporated into the print and online editions of the newspaper. For example, after the deadly house explosion in Floral Park, Queens, on Friday, we first published and continued to update a blog post with the essential details, as soon as we could confirm them. Later, we published a full account in the form of a more traditional news article for print and the Web. We also use City Room to highlight posts about New York City from the dozens of other blogs on NYTimes.com produced by other desks and departments. Sometimes, reader comments on City Room will inform reporting for the daily editions. For example, Sam Roberts 's article on Sunday about New Yorkers who are thinking of leaving the city because of the recession drew from the hundreds of comments in response to a City Room query that he posed to readers last week. The comments were also the subject of a follow-up blog post . Monday through Saturday, the New York report in the print edition carries a City Room column — we call it "the rail" — with excerpts from the blog, including condensed versions of blog posts, readers' comments, excerpts from our Taking Questions feature, and more. All members of the Metro staff are encouraged to contribute to the blog, and do. But some staff members are directly assigned to City Room, including myself; my editor, Patrick LaForge ; a Web producer, Emily S. Rueb ; and several other metropolitan reporters: David W. Dunlap , Corey Kilgannon , Jennifer 8. Lee and A. G. Sulzberger . Still others contribute regular features. Reporting assignments are subject to change based on the overall needs of the Metro desk. Ever Get Tired of the City? Q. There is no denying that New York City is diverse and complex, but every city has its own patterns and trends. Have you ever felt tired of reporting on certain subjects because they have been repeatedly covered? Can you name a couple of things that are both new and unique in our city? A. To paraphrase Samuel Johnson, when a man is tired of New York, he is tired of life. When we started City Room, we quoted E. B. White describing New York as "both changeless and changing."   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   To be sure, some stories seem to pop up again and again. The city's reliance on Wall Street ties its fortunes closely to the boom-and-bust cycles of global finance, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's finances seem to constantly gyrate between prosperity and insolvency, and  the Second Avenue subway (and for that matter, the idea of placing tolls on the East River bridges) has been on the drawing board for decades. Other news seems entirely unpredictable, with the benefit of hindsight. Who could have foreseen the toppling of a governor by a prostitution scandal or the election of a billionaire mayor — or, for that matter, four consecutive elections of non-Democratic mayors (and possibly a fifth, coming up in November) in this overwhelmingly Democratic city? To "cover" New York City is in some ways an impossible task, an insight pointed out in one of the best essays I've ever read about New York, Dan Barry 's "Who Can Claim to Know a City of 8 Million?" At its best, each day this blog gives readers a sense of the biggest news of the day, along with glimpses — sometimes fleeting and always, no doubt, imperfect — of life in one of the world's greatest cities. Taking It to the Street Q. I have noticed that coverage in recent months has been tilted overwhelmingly toward Wall Street  and the fallout. I realize this is important, but so are stories of how more modest people living in theother boroughs, e.g. immigrants in Queens, etc., are building their lives. There is a lot of assimilation going on, whereby people that were on the fringes of political power in the past, are now beginning to participate: via school boards, local councils, etc. Can we expect to see more coverage of this news? A. We leave the Wall Street coverage to the business desk, particularly the Dealbook site. While we do sometimes cover the New Yorkers who inhabit the world of finance ( especially when planes overhead stir panic ), our focus is on the people and neighborhoods of all five boroughs. When we cover economics, we like to take it to the street level. For example, City Room's new weekly feature, New York on Less , examines the impact of the recession in the city. But in the (print and Web) pages of The Times you will find many examples of articles on the topics you mention. On Sunday, David Gonzalez explored the plight of a Latino family in Queens led by an Ecuadorean couple who are undocumented immigrants. Julie Bosman , who covers social services in the New York region, has written about the recession's impact on foster care , homelessness and child support . Kirk Semple ,  who writes about immigration in New York, recently wrote about the heated race for the presidency of a Korean-American civic group , a race with implications for the incorporation of immigrants into the city's political life. Writing for Non-New Yorkers? Q. I grew up in the city so I tend to be interested in the blog and in city-related stories even though I haven’t lived in New York for many years.  That said, many people who read The Times do not live in New York.  Could you comment on how you structure both the blog and stories so that they appeal not only to the New York audience (or those of us who know New York well) but for people who are not in New York but read The New York Times online? A. Our focus is on the five boroughs of New York City, and we write from the point of view of New Yorkers who live in the city, but we've been delighted that City Room has attracted a broad following beyond the metropolitan region. We believe the city is a vital character, a well-known one, to people around the world, not only to transplanted New Yorkers but to its many visitors and those who aspire to be New Yorkers. We don't bend over backwards to explain local references to outsiders. We think many readers would find that to be condescending. The Web, of course, allows us to provide background links to the more obscure references. And if readers ask a question in the comments about, say, how a MetroCard works, we are always happy to answer. We like to think that New York holds great interest for anyone who cares about cities, immigration, architecture, urban planning, American history and other broad topics. Many Americans have immigrant ancestors who came through Ellis Island, have relatives who live here or aspire to live here. Then there are the former New Yorkers who have left the city but want to stay in touch.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   City Room has tried to represent the international flavor of the city, with posts on New York's sister province in China , a Georgian leader's years here , and the visits by Pope Benedict XVI , the king of Sweden and the president of Iran . Our blog also has a strong interest in local history. Blog posts on such varied subjects as Jewish delis , the 1977 blackout and the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree have elicited nostalgic responses from readers outside New York. Blogging the Newsroom? Q. Has The Times ever considered blogging about what’s actually taking place in the newsroom, which might include editors assigning stories to staff members, if the reporter or photographer are stuck in traffic trying to get to the crime scene, a summary of spirited debates that took place in the editors news meetings, and if the copy desk or reporter is struggling meeting a fast approaching deadline? Such a blog, might give readers a greater appreciation of the many hoops a daily newspaper typically goes through before a story is posted online or published in the morning newspaper. A. Interesting suggestions! You get to the heart of a key challenge in working on a breaking-news blog: Balancing speed with accuracy. I am grateful for your appreciation of the challenges, logistical and otherwise, that reporters face in gathering the news. The voice and tone of City Room are often more informal than those of traditional news articles. That allows us to note that we have sent a reporter to a scene and hope to have more details soon, or to mention that we are still waiting for someone to call back with more information, or to ask readers to send in information, photos and video. Here's an interesting example where we described an effort by a Times editor to coax a reluctant subway hero into an interview . It took another day, but that helped us to get the story. Increasingly, we are more transparent about the journalistic process of City Room. Take the use of social media, like Facebook and Twitter. An example from yesterday: My editor, Patrick LaForge, who has taken to Twitter with relish, used his own Twitter account, @palafo , and the City Room Twitter account on Monday morning to ask readers if they had seen or heard of the low-flying Air Force jet that rattled nerves in Lower Manhattan . That quickly helped to inform our coverage, as this article in the Nieman Journalism Lab points out. The dominant photo of the plane on the front page of the print edition this morning, as well as other pictures, were submitted by readers through City Room. With all that said, we haven't really written in detail about our internal news deliberations or our daily struggles to meet deadline.  Perhaps we're wrong, but we don't feel readers have a lot of patience for too much inside baseball or musings about how hard our jobs are! Differences Between Blogs and News Articles? Q. Does your approach to reporting differ depending on whether you are writing an article or a blog item? What do you see as the main differences between blog items and news articles? Do you preferwriting one over the other?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A. Our standards of accuracy, verification, fairness and completeness are the same for blog items and news articles. If you look at The Times's news blogs — which now number nearly 50 — you will see a tremendous variety of subject matter. I view the blog simply as a platform — a flexible, nimble, easy-to-use platform — for delivering information. That said, there are some differences between blog posts and news articles. Blog posts on City Room are often updated incrementally, as news develops. There may be a series of posts on a news event or topic that are later incorporated into a single, traditional news article. A breaking news event that sounds serious at first may fizzle out after more reporting. The tone of a blog post might often seem more conversational and less comprehensive than most traditional news articles, but we don't put anything on the blog that we would not be comfortable seeing in print. (Admittedly, we have experimented with first-person accounts, contests and even poetry.) We do avoid the opinion and mean-spirited snark associated with some blogs; snark isn't our thing. For an amusing example of how links can be used effectively (and humorously) on a blog in a way that would not be possible in a traditional news article, see the lead (the first paragraph) of this May 2008 blog post by my colleague Jennifer 8. Lee . About That Flyover by the Air Force One Backup Q. Why isn't Police Commissioner Kelly being taken to task for not informing the mayor of the Air Force One photo-op.  Instead the media and the mayor single out some mid-level manager?  Isn't the commissioner in constant contact with the mayor? A. As we reported on the blog and in our print and online editions , the White House notified an employee in Mayor Bloomberg's office about the flyover. That employee, Marc Mugnos, director of operations at the city’s event coordination and management office, has been reprimanded for failing to notify his superiors, according to the mayor's office. The Police Department has also said that it was notified about the flyover by the Federal Aviation Administration, but was directed not to issue a broad notification to the public.  Photo        Sewell Chan   Credit Earl Wilson/The New York Times    Is the Blog Editing Process Different? Q. How does the editing process differ between blogs and news stories for the print editions? Do copy editors read blog posts, as they do for print stories? Is there a slot-rim process, as there is in print? Does the need for speed trump careful editing, as it does in so many other ways on the Web? A. I asked my editor, Patrick LaForge, to handle this one. He writes: I can't speak for all the blogs at The Times. There are various editing arrangements based on how much traffic they get and how often they publish. On City Room, we have two copy editors, Mike Richard and Jim Hunt. The editing process is similar to how the newspaper handles fast-breaking news close to the print deadline.  The newspaper work flow was created to print everything at once in discrete editions for a press run. That limits our ability to go back into articles, so we have multiple editing layers. A reporter's assigning editor gives a first read to the copy for substance and newsworthiness, then sends it to a copy editor on the rim , who does a close line edit for grammar and style, adjusts for the layout, writes headlines and other big type. Then a supervising editor — the slot — gives a final read before the type is set for the press. Any number of other editors may be looking over their shoulders, depending on the importance of the story (page one and section front articles get more attention). This editing could take a couple of hours, or mere minutes, depending on when the news broke. Once the presses roll, our hands are tied until the next edition.  The Web is different. We can always go back in to make a fix, add a quote, drop in a link. And we do, often updating a blog post — and reading it over again — several times a day. Non-urgent City Room features get the same editing treatment as newspaper articles. With breaking news, blog writing tends to be more utilitarian, aimed at getting clear, useful information to readers as quickly as possible. We also aim to keep posts shorter than newspaper articles, with some exceptions for comprehensive link roundups. There are no physical space limits, as for print; the main constraints are reader time and patience. This is our greatest editing challenge, because there's truth to the old saw that it takes longer to write a short, complete article than a long one.  At least one person besides the writer reads every post before it goes up. We prefer to have two editors see it. But for some breaking news, we publish fast after a quick edit, then a copy editor jumps in quickly to clean things up. Our job descriptions get a little fuzzy on the blog, too. From time to time, to some degree, all of us have played the roles of writer, assigning editor, copy editor, slot, and Web producer. We keep track of the work through an instant-message group chat devoted to production. Every post eventually gets the same scrutiny as articles for the newspaper.  Are there some trade-offs for speed and breaking news? Yes, and we think readers understand that. Publishing news of an explosion would trump esoteric style questions and other issues that would hold up a print article — lack of a photo, or an interesting but nonessential detail. The basic rules of writing and journalism apply. We expect posts to be grammatical and make sense and observe standards of fairness and accuracy. When a fact is in doubt, we leave it out. We try to be straight with readers about unanswered questions, and what we do not know. Do we sometimes publish typos, factual errors or grammatical errors? Sure, and so does the newspaper. We aren't perfect. We welcome help from readers: If you see a problem, please send an e-mail message immediately to cityroom@nytimes.com . We'll correct it. And thank you. The End of the City Section Q. As a native New Yorker, like yourself, I have been reading the City section for many, many years.  I was so sad to hear that this section is being discontinued. The section had the most interesting stories about different neighborhoods and profiles of real New Yorkers? Why oh why  is this section being discontinued? I  love the articles about the history of the city as well as the human interest stories. Let us have less about Wall Street and more about the people of New York City. Within these stories you will find the "heart and soul' of the real New York." Keep up the good work. Your stories are awesome   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A. I posed your question to Jodi Rudoren , the deputy metropolitan editor who will be running our new Sunday metropolitan section: Many of us in the newsroom, too, are sad to see The City section go. The City, along with parallel weekly sections that circulate in New Jersey , Westchester , Long Island and Connecticut , had terrific ground-level neighborhood coverage, wonderful photography and interesting non-Times writers that brought different voices into our pages. That said, it always seemed a bit strange to some of us that local coverage was scattered in different places on Sundays — and that so much of it was only available in print to narrow slices of our audience.  The decision to close these sections was driven largely by costs, but we are seizing the opportunity to invent a splashy new Sunday section that we hope will retain the best of The City and the regional weeklies while experimenting with new storytelling forms. It is conceived as a magazine-style feature section, with deep narratives and columns, as well as highly visual graphics, interviews and neighborhood guides, and will be a writing showcase for some of our biggest talents. One in 8 Million , our hugely popular audio and photo series about individual New York characters, will be migrating from the Friday paper to the new Sunday section, where it will get a bigger display. We'll also be trying out some unconventional ideas, and stretching our own boundaries a bit every week. Some of these new features will also have related content online and on City Room.  While nobody is happy to lose The City, we are quite excited about what we're creating. We hope you will become a dedicated reader. And that you will let us know what you like, what you don't, and what you'd like to see instead. About David Dunlap Q. What's the deal with David Dunlap ? He seems to know everything about the history of New York. And he takes some cool photos, too. A. We're big fans of Mr. Dunlap, too. We asked him to respond: My mother wondered that until the day she died.  Some clues: I inherited my love of architecture from my father, William E. Dunlap , who was a student and colleague of Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology and a partner in the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill . He took me to see the Robie House at an age when my schoolmates were going to Riverview amusement park. I resented it deeply. Nonetheless, when it came time to pick a major at Yale, I was inspired by Professor Vincent Scully to chose art history, specializing in architecture. (That is, when I managed to stagger to class.) I was graduated in 1975, but it took me 16 years to complete my senior paper, on the development of religious architecture in New York City from the colonial to modern eras.  In 1978, Paul Goldberger , then the architecture critic of The Times, asked me if I would take the pictures for his guidebook, "The City Observed: New York." I was an amateur and came cheap. The photo contract arrived from Random House just before an 88-day newspaper strike that left me with nothing else to do for three summer months but explore Manhattan in its entirety, cameras in hand. That was the beginning of my New York education.  My first bylined front-page article for The Times was about the surprise demolition of the Biltmore Hotel, where generations of New Yorkers had met under the clock. That was in 1981, and I have more or less covered the construction, preservation and demolition of landmarks — official and unofficial — ever since. The Times has afforded me the opportunity for a graduate-level education in urban history that my college grade-point average would never have allowed.  I've supplemented that with two books, " On Broadway: A Journey Uptown Over Time " (Rizzoli International, 1990) and " From Abyssinian to Zion: A Guide to Manhattan's Houses of Worship " (Columbia University Press, 2004) — a greatly expanded version of my senior paper. I took all the photographs for those books, too, because my rates were so reasonable.  As the paper's architectural historian, I was asked to write what amounted to an obituary of the World Trade Center on the day after the twin towers were destroyed. In 2003, I began covering the redevelopment of ground zero on a regular basis and hope that I'll have a chance to chronicle the completion of a building or two down there before my anticipated retirement in 2017.  I am also helping the photographer James Estrin and other Times colleagues develop a new blog, called Lens, that will be a showcase for photojournalism. We hope to launch it May 18.  My recent forays into video can be traced to the fact that I was a teenage filmmaker, working in Super 8 Kodachrome under the pseudonym Arlo Dunkle. Among those in attendance at the 1972 world premiere of my chef-d'oeuvre, "Dunkle Satyricon," was Pauline Kael of The New Yorker. The event was marred by the irreparable failure of the synch-sound 8-millimeter projector about 10 minutes into the screening of the 90-minute movie.  During the awkward interval before the premiere was canceled outright, the woman who was then America's most influential film critic turned to me and asked, "Tell me, Mr. Dunkle, does it get any better after this?" "Miss Kael," I answered, "how could a film get any worse?"  Thank you for your kind words, Charlie. Keeping All the Balls in the Air Q. You post so frequently, with such a low correction rate, that I assume you’re an efficient multitasker. Any tips on how other people can juggle tasks efficiently? Any tech tips, or old-fashioned strategies? A. Thanks for the compliment! I'm flattered, but I'm afraid I'm probably no more efficient than any other journalist trying to navigate his or her way through an information-saturated society. I get hundreds of e-mail messages each day — among them announcements from city agencies, press releases from nonprofit organizations, alerts from other news outlets and updates from Times reporters in the newsroom and in the field — and I also try to monitor the local news stations on television. I use some of the filtering functions on Gmail to sort through the large volume of e-mail. I just started using TweetDeck to monitor the Twitter feeds and Facebook status updates of people I follow. I'm constantly using instant messaging, both AOL Instant Messenger and Gchat, to communicate with colleagues. I mostly use the phone when I need to conduct an interview or track down a source. I probably don't leave my chair and cubicle nearly as often as I should. Your question hints at a larger issue that has engaged my interest: blogger burnout.  Web journalism has a uniquely voracious and unceasing quality.  I wonder whether the relentless demand for news and information has added to the demands and workloads of journalists. The Times has long been known for covering the news in a smart, authoritative and analytical fashion. Increasingly, now, we also try — and are expected — to be first, or at least close to first, on breaking news. Balancing the demands of speed and accuracy, as I indicated in an  earlier response, is one of the greatest challenges we face at City Room. So far (I write with my fingers crossed) it's been manageable. The Flu and the City Q. What is the city's plan against swine influenza? Will the subways be operating? Q. Is it safe to go to New York? I am planning on flying out of California this weekend to meet a friend of mine who is also flying into town from Brazil. With the news we see about the swine flu online, we are concerned about the trip to New York. Would you say things are safe and we should just go and enjoy the city? A. New York City officials say they have been preparing for an influenza pandemic for at least five years, and the city's Health Department has set up a swine flu Web site with links to local resources and information. The city has one of the most extensive epidemiological surveillance systems in the United States. So far, federal, state and local health authorities say it is safe to travel to and within New York City. There are no plans to alter subway service in response to the flu outbreak. That said, flu is definitely on everyone's minds. Today, my colleague Anne Barnard is using City Room to ask readers who live in New York for their thoughts about how swine flu has changed their daily habits , particularly on the subway.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Is It O.K. to Tweet The Times? Q. I live in Atlanta but have a subscription to The New York Times.  I'm a huge fan! I sometimes tweet Times stories on Twitter. Am I in danger of copyright infringement? A. Thanks for asking. We absolutely encourage readers to Twitter  articles, slide shows and other content on The Times's Web site. In addition, each article on the site has a button allowing readers to share the article on the social-media sites Digg, Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Mixx and YahooBuzz. And we also encourage readers to use TimesPeople , a new way to discover what other readers find interesting on NYTimes.com. We don't consider disseminating links to Times content to be a violation of copyright law or fair use. The only copyright problems arise when people take large portions of our content and publish them elsewhere. What About Staten Island? Q. Why is there so little coverage of  Staten Island, the city's fastest-growing borough and the fastest-growing county in New York State? Why does The Times repeatedly go with stories that affirm its own perception of Staten Island as a borough of blue-collar, racist know-nothings, when in fact the story is more complicated — indicating that the borough is fast becoming more like the other boroughs in terms of diversity and urban vs. suburban identity/perspective? A. I agree we should try to cover Staten Island more on the City Room blog — as is the case with many other New York City neighborhoods and communities —  but I strongly disagree with your premise. In recent memory The Times has published a variety of stories on topics affecting Staten Islanders, from housing foreclosures to wind power to deer sightings . As for the borough's increasing diversity, my colleague Nina Bernstein , who writes about immigration, last  year described the plight of a Sri Lankan-born man on  Staten Island who was struggling to get a tourist visa for his sister to come visit him after his Taiwanese-born wife died, leaving behind their newborn son. One of the most memorable articles on Staten Island I've ever read was " Walking on the City's Wild Side ," written in 2006  by my colleague Andy Newman , who circumnavigated the borough on foot. (Don't miss the accompanying video and slide show .)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Staying Connected Q. As local bloggers and journalists in such a huge, diverse city, how do you attempt to stay connected to so many different populations, neighborhoods, and "scenes"? How do you reach beyond your own networks and interests to find stories that truly represent the diversity of the city? A. It's a great question. Part of the answer is that City Room is fortunate to be part of a flourishing online community of writers, bloggers, photographers and other creative types interested in New York. The blogroll on the front page of City Room has links to more than 250 blogs and Web sites that focus on New York City. That said, the online world does not fully represent social reality. The overwhelming majority of New York City blogs that we've encountered focus on Brooklyn and Manhattan. Parts of "brownstone Brooklyn" — which includes neighborhoods like Park Slope and Prospect Heights — are particularly well-represented on the blogosphere. But many communities across all five boroughs are under-blogged, you could say. Along with reading other blogs and subscribing to their RSS feeds, we are on lots of e-mail lists. We constantly receive messages from elected officials, community boards, nonprofit groups, neighborhood associations and advocates for various constituencies and interests. We are interested in the city's diverse ethnic press, which is a rich source of information about New York's immigrant communities. The Independent Press Association , which represents local ethnic media, provides translations of selected articles from foreign-language publications. Finally, I'd like to mention The Local, a new community blog experiment by The Times. My colleague Andy Newman, whom I mentioned above, works on The Local for the Fort Greene and Clinton Hill neighborhoods in Brooklyn, while Tina Kelley coordinates The Local devoted to the New Jersey towns of Maplewood, Millburn and South Orange . As the name  suggests, both blogs operate at a more granular, community-oriented level than City Room can, incorporating citizen journalism into their sites. Deciding What Goes in the Blog Q. You have noted that the standards for stories on the blog are similar to those for stories in the paper, and that the blog is often at the center of coverage on important breaking stories. How do you think about what stories or topics need to be in the blog — versus what you want to put there? And how does that compare to what editors feel must be covered in the Metro section in the print edition? And has your thinking about what belongs on the blog changed in the two years you have presided over it? A. Karen, it's great to hear from you!  I think the mix of topics on City Room has been fairly consistent since the blog began in June 2007. We aim for a healthy mix of subject matter each day. At certain times, like the weeks  before the Super Tuesday primaries in 2008, the blog has focused on political news, and leading up to the city elections this November, we expect to continue to have many more campaign-themed items. Our coverage is organized into six broad areas: government and politics, crime and public safety, housing and the economy, transportation, schools, and people and neighborhoods. Individual blog posts are also given categories and tags to help readers find them through online word searches.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A look at some of the most-visited blog posts in City Room's first two years suggests a wide range of subject matter: the death of the actor Heath Ledger ; the emergency landing of Flight 1549 in the Hudson River; the detention of a Boston-based performance artist ; the most recent M.T.A. fare increase and service cuts ; a controversial New York Post cartoon that was criticized as racist;  Representative Charles B. Rangel's defense of his use of four rent-stabilized apartments; the arrest of 22 protesters who had occupied a New School building; and the scaling of the New York Times building by the French stuntman Alain Robert. In some ways, City Room is like a weekday, daylong broadcast of news and information. We aim for good variety — a mix. That includes  posts about animal shelters and dog runs , subjects we know will be popular among readers, but also posts on subjects that often get too little attention, homeless shelters for gay and lesbian youth and economic inequality . Although there are stylistic differences between blog posts and traditional news articles, as discussed above, we don't see a dramatic distinction in types of subjects covered by the blog and by the print edition.  City Room is simply an attempt to use the flexible medium of blogging to provide what The Times aspires to provide: thorough, accurate, fair and incisive reporting; graceful and stylish writing; and creative use of photos, video, graphics and multimedia, which are all increasingly important forms of story-telling. Starting a Blog Q. As an aspiring public servant and native New Yorker, I try to keep myself constantly informed about goings on in our great city, usually by reading City Room throughout the day. As much as I love reading your coverage, I'm also interested in blogging about my own interests in the city. Do you have any suggestions for New Yorkers who want to start their own City Room? Or Neighborhood Room? Maybe even suggestions as to how young New Yorkers can break into the field of local journalism? Basically, how can I become your sidekick? A. We're flattered by your offer. Blog publishing platforms like Wordpress (the software we use), MovableType and Typepad have made it easy for millions of people across the world to create blogs and have their voices heard. Some of the most interesting blogs we've discovered (including those on our blogroll) began as one-person operations. Yours could be next. The Tone of Blogs Q.
