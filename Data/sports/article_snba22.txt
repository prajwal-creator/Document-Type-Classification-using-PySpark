The National College Players Association organized All Players United. The association, founded by the former U.C.L.A. player Ramogi Huma, is pushing for better health care of college athletes, more scholarship money, and the lifting of N.C.A.A. restrictions on legitimate employment and the players’ ability to directly benefit from commercial opportunities.

Marshall and host Virginia Tech matched a lack of scoring for two. The game entered overtime tied at 21-21. In the first extra period, the backup kicker Ethan Keyserling missed a 50-yard field-goal attempt for Virginia Tech. Marshall also failed to score as the Hokies blocked Justin Haig’s 39-yard attempt. In the second overtime, Marshall lost a fumble, and Keyserling missed a 32-yard field-goal attempt. Logan Thomas finally gave the Hokies a 29-21 lead in the third overtime, running for a 2-yard touchdown and then for a 2-point conversion (teams must go for 2 after the second overtime). The Virginia Tech defense then held off Marshall for the victory. BACK, THEN OUT AGAIN David Ash, back as the Texas quarterback after missing a game with concussionlike symptoms, passed for 166 yards and a touchdown in the first half against Kansas State. He missed the second half with a new head injury as the host Longhorns, coming off disappointing losses to Brigham Young and Mississippi, won by 31-21. Ash, who had been cleared to play Friday night, showed no effects of the previous head injury early. But he took several big hits, both on runs and when standing in the pocket, before throwing a touchdown pass to Kendall Sanders. Case McCoy took over at quarterback in the second half and led two touchdown drives.
