The players union will soon be back in business, ensuring a timely completion of a new labor deal and a Christmas Day opening. Meanwhile, the players’ faces are slowly returning to N.B.A. Web sites . On Thursday night, the league began restoring the players’ names, faces, statistics and video to NBA.com and the Web sites of all 30 teams. The transition was expected to be complete by Friday morning. NBA TV will likewise cease its frequent replays of “Teen Wolf” and “The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh” in favor of more current and vital programming. Starting at 1 a.m. Eastern on Friday, the channel was to begin carrying condensed, one-hour replays of each game of the 2011 N.B.A. finals. Those highlights will be repeated until 7 p.m. Friday, when “N.B.A. Game Time” will return. The full schedule for the 66-game season will be announced Tuesday at 7 p.m., on NBATV. All references to the players were expunged from the N.B.A.’s digital platforms on July 1, when the league imposed a lockout. The parties reached a tentative settlement last Saturday.

More than 300 had been submitted to the American Arbitration Association as of 6 p.m. Thursday.

The parties subsequently resumed negotiations.

It has been functioning for the last two weeks as a professional association, rather than a union, but with all of the same employees and contractual relationships. Once the N.B.P.A. is officially recognized as a union again, the parties will return to the table and negotiate a number of so-called B-list items for the new labor deal. Ratification by the owners and players is expected late next week. The league is planning to open training camps and free agency next Friday, with opening day set for Dec. 25. Although there were fewer than 440 players on N.B.A. rosters at the end of last season, the N.B.P.A. also sent signature cards to 60 rookies and to players who signed 10-day contracts.
