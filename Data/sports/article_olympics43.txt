The golden plaque, attached to the Voyager spacecraft, was etched with a medley of Earth sounds, from a baby’s cry to musical selections ranging from a Bach fugue to Chuck Berry’s upbeat “ Johnny B. Goode .” Not long after the probe was launched, a psychic played by Steve Martin on “Saturday Night Live” revealed that aliens had promptly delivered this urgent four-word response: “Send more Chuck Berry.” The news last week that a concerted scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence by the SETI Institute in California has resumed raises fundamental questions: If we made contact, what would we say? And what answers would we anticipate? The first words of a conversation initiated by aliens were immortalized in a 1953 New Yorker cartoon by Alex Graham: “Kindly take us to your President!” Our own greetings have already been inadvertently transmitted, if not delivered, in random radio broadcasts that are just now reaching roughly 100 light-years away. Among the first images that escaped the earth’s atmosphere was a 1936 telecast of the Nazi-produced Olympics. If intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe, two giant hurdles would have to be overcome to have a conversation. Dialogue would probably be intergenerational — a response to a message sent by us would likely be delivered to a distant descendant. “You should think of METI messages” — referring to messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence rather than searching — “as being like time capsules, rather than like telephone calls,” said Michael W. Busch of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at the University of California, Los Angeles.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Moreover, could we find a common language? Maybe science, because, said Jacob D. Haqq-Misra, a research scientist at the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, “physical principles, such as the structure of a hydrogen atom or the action of gravity, likely apply everywhere in the galaxy.” (No matter how many rehearsals for the magic moment, even a canned cosmic quote can be flubbed in nerve-racking real time. Remember Neil Armstrong’s “ one small step for a man .”)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Still, in an era when bureaucrats produce contingency plans for every eventuality, it strains credulity to imagine that no protocol exists to carry on a conversation that may already have begun. “There is, in fact, a protocol developed by the International Academy of Astronautics and the International Institute of Space Law,” said Jill Tarter, director of the Center for SETI Research. “It boils down to, if you get what looks like a signal from another civilization, then let the whole world know, but don’t reply until there’s been international consultation. The real challenge is to get that international consultation going before we know if anyone’s out there.” The Voyager’s record carried greetings in 55 languages, including a folksy one in Amoy, a Chinese dialect, which was translated as: “Friends of space, how are you all? Have you eaten yet? Come visit us if you have time.” But some scientists warn that an invitation, or even contact, would make us vulnerable to evil aliens. “The biggest thing I’d want to get out of the conversation is information about the ET’s values,” said Seth Baum , a doctoral student at Penn State and executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute. “Do they want to help us, harm us or do something else? This is crucial because in all likelihood the ET civilization will be more advanced than ours and thus able to get what it wants.” Other scientists suggest that given the number of radio and television broadcasts that have leaked into the universe, aliens may already know we’re here. The SETI Institute has begun an online outreach program called Earth Speaks to solicit messages. Dimitra Atri , a physics professor at the University of Kansas, and several colleagues recently created another Web site, DearET . Of the message suggestions received by Earth Speaks, many are variations on a theme, which may say more about earthlings than about extraterrestrials. “Instead of listing our achievements and goals, or attempting to sensibly encode our biological structure, or providing instructions on navigating our solar system,” said Douglas A. Vakoch , director of interstellar message composition for the SETI Institute, “the loudest message is people asking for help.” (Among them: “Seen about seven weird red lights in the sky around 8:12 p.m. on Hwy H between Higbee, Mo., and Fayette, Mo., last night. Was curious if anyone knows what they were.”) Perhaps help is on the way. If space aliens are benign, maybe their goal is to foster a cooperative conversation here on Earth. “There is only an infinitesimal chance that the plaque will ever be seen by a single extraterrestrial, but it will certainly be seen by billions of terrestrials,” B. M. Oliver, vice president for research at Hewlett-Packard, said after the Voyager, which is still hurtling into space at nearly 100,000 miles an hour, was launched. “Its real function ... is to appeal to and expand the human spirit and to make contact with extraterrestrial intelligence a welcome expectation of mankind.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In other words, where’s Chuck Berry now that we need him?   Correction: February 19, 2012   A news analysis article last Sunday about new efforts to communicate with extraterrestrials misquoted the caption on a 1953 cartoon in The New Yorker that has been described as a source for the science-fiction catchphrase “Take me to your leader.” The cartoon, by Alex Graham, depicted two aliens telling a four-legged animal — perhaps a donkey, perhaps a horse — “Kindly take us to your President!”      Sam Roberts is the urban affairs correspondent of The New York Times.  A version of this news analysis appears in print on February 12, 2012, on Page SR4 of the New York edition with the headline: What Do You Say to an Alien?.
