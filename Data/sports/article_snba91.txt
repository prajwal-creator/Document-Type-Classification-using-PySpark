But the shelf of Jim Abbott's locker was stuffed with more than 100 letters. ''One week's fan mail?'' somebody asked. ''That's just today's,'' Jim Abbott said. ''Phenom,'' short for ''phenomenon,'' is an overused baseball word for a touted rookie. But of all the players in spring training this year, 21-year-old James Anthony Abbott is the real phenom: he was born without a right hand. And, graciously, in his long profile in the Angels' media guide, there is no mention of his being a one-handed pitcher. ''It was in there originally, but we decided to take it out,'' said Tim Mead, the Angels' public-relations director. ''There's no need for it.'' Not after Jim Abbott pitched the United States to the Olympic baseball gold medal in Seoul, South Korea. Not after he was the Angels' first-round draft choice. Not after he received the 1988 Sullivan Award as the nation's outstanding amateur athlete. Not after he had a 26-8 won-lost record in three years at the University of Michigan with a 3.03 earned run average and 183 strikeouts in 234 innings. Not after his fastball has been clocked at 93 m.p.h.

He's got the arm, the makeup, all the intangibles. I wouldn't put any restraints on where he might pitch this year. To categorize him would be unfair. He's a unique human being.''  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       In five innings, two against the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday after three against the San Diego Padres in a ''B'' game last Friday, Abbott has allowed one run, three hits and two walks while striking out five. With two on and two out Tuesday, he fanned Jose Canseco on a hard slider inside. But the next inning, on a grounder hit back to him, he missed the opportunity for a double play when he had trouble getting the ball out of his glove. ''You look at other guys with exceptional arms and they're not particularly good fielders,'' Rader said. ''I'd rather look at what he can do. The only thing you expect from him is something good.'' Lance Parrish, the Angels' new catcher, compared Abbott's fastball with that of Ron Guidry at the Yankee left-hander's best. Joe Coleman, the Angels' bullpen coach, compared his smooth windup and delivery with that of Steve Carlton, another lanky left-hander. Marcel Lachemann, the Angels' pitching coach, talked about his ''good stuff, good delivery, his balance, and how he stays behind the ball,'' but acknowledged that he's ''not the best'' fielding pitcher.

On sharp grounders, his problem is getting the ball out of his glove, which he switches to his left hand. But when he finishes his follow-through, his glove is in front of him. Too many pitchers leave their gloved hand behind their back. And when the 6-foot-3-inch, 200-pound left-hander with a boyish face that Norman Rockwell would have cherished was asked how he'd react to a streaking liner, he laughed. ''I'll do what everybody else does,'' he said. ''I'll duck.'' Originally, the Angels planned to let Abbott open the season with their Midland, Tex., farm team in the Class AA Texas League. But now they're thinking that he's good enough to pitch at Edmonton, Alberta, in the AAA Pacific Coast League. If he does well there, he could be pitching for the Angels sometime later this season. ''We'd need a problem with one of our five starters,'' Rader said. ''Jim's a starter. We're not thinking of him as a relief pitcher.''

Preston Gomez, once the Houston Astros' manager and now in the Angels front office, played with Gray at Toledo of the American Association after the war. ''Pete Gray lost his arm in a childhood accident; he thought everybody was against him,'' Gomez said. ''Jim Abbott was born this way. He's accepted it. He's a great kid.'' Gomez, who occasionally visits his native Cuba, remembered Abbott pitching a United States team to an 8-3 victory in Havana in 1987, the first American pitcher to defeat a Cuban team in Cuba in a quarter of a century. ''The next day Castro came to the ball park to meet him,'' Gomez said. ''And in spring training here this year, it's the same way. Whenever he goes from one diamond to another at our complex, people follow him.'' In the months to come, people will follow Jim Abbott all the way to the big leagues.
