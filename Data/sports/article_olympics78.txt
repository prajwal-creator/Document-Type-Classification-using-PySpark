Players Association will not appeal Albert Haynesworth’s five-game suspension for stomping on the head of Dallas center Andre Gurode last Sunday, leaving seven cuts requiring 30 stitches. Haynesworth, the Tennessee Titans defensive tackle, announced through his agent Tuesday that he would not appeal the ban. The Players Association executive director, Gene Upshaw, discussed the ban with Haynesworth and N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell. “We represent both players here, and it is best for all concerned that we let the suspension stand,” Upshaw said yesterday. “While Roger has expressed a willingness to meet with Haynesworth, and I expect that meeting to take place, there will be no formal hearing where the suspension will be challenged.” (AP) RAVENS’ SAMS CHARGED WITH D.U.I. Baltimore Ravens kickoff returner B. J. Sams, whose 30.9-yard-a-return average ranks second in the N.F.L., was charged with driving under the influence, his second D.U.I. arrest in 14 months. Sams was stopped shortly before 2 a.m. Tuesday on the Baltimore Beltway, the police said. A second violation of the league’s substance-abuse policy could result in a four-game suspension. (AP) OWENS AND MCNABB BACK TO BUSINESS Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, meeting with reporters in anticipation of the game with the Dallas Cowboys and Terrell Owens in Philadelphia on Sunday, said he reached out to Owens last week.

Robinson pleaded guilty last year to drunken driving and was given a five-year sentence that was suspended on the condition he not drink or have any other law violations. He was charged with drunken driving again after he was stopped for speeding in August in Minnesota near the Vikings’ training camp, leading to yesterday’s hearing. He was released by the Vikings after that incident. (AP) Basketball WIZARDS EXTEND GRUNFELD’S CONTRACT Washington’s president of basketball operations, Ernie Grunfeld, signed a multiyear contract extension yesterday, a reward for rebuilding the team into a playoff contender. Financial terms of the deal were not announced. Grunfeld, hired in June 2003, signed the star point guard Gilbert Arenas as a free agent and traded for forwards Antawn Jamison and Caron Butler. They formed the three highest-scoring teammates in the N.B.A. last season, when the Wizards made a second consecutive trip to the postseason.
