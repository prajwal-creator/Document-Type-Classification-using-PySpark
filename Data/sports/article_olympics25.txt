It was that relationship, and the select few people who enjoy access to it, that won freedom for Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the former oil billionaire suddenly granted clemency by President Vladimir V. Putin and flown to Berlin. Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Russian speaker who has a matter-of-fact, occasionally frosty relationship with Mr. Putin, and her Social Democratic predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, who maintains warm ties to the Russian leader, both raised Mr. Khodorkovsky’s case with Mr. Putin over the decade of his imprisonment. But it was a highly experienced former foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who at the age of 86 achieved an agreement with Mr. Putin. That involved two meetings between Mr. Genscher and Mr. Putin — one at Tegel airport in Berlin at the end of Mr. Putin’s first visit to Germany after he was re-elected in 2012, the other in Moscow, according to the German news media and statements from Mr. Genscher himself. Ms. Merkel was kept informed of the secret talks, as was the top echelon of the German Embassy in Moscow, which expedited a visa for Mr. Khodorkovsky late last week once it became clear from Mr. Putin’s surprising talk of clemency on Thursday that it would be granted.

First, he heard Mr. Putin, during his annual news conference, all but rule out a third case against him. Then he saw Mr. Putin, speaking to reporters after the news conference, suddenly raise the prospect of clemency.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Khodorkovsky’s first thought was to gather up his valuable papers and prepare to leave, he said over the weekend. Fellow inmates who spoke with him, he told The New Times, a weekly Russian newspaper, shook his hand in congratulations. The inmates, like Mr. Khodorkovsky, understood that once Mr. Putin had mentioned clemency, his most famous prisoner would be leaving soon. Mr. Khodorkovsky said he went to bed as usual, and had no trouble sleeping. Shortly after 2 a.m. Friday, he was awoken and told to leave. He was flown eventually to St. Petersburg, and on to Germany, where he was greeted by Mr. Genscher and Alexander Rahr, a German academic with close ties to the Kremlin.

It was characteristic on Friday that he gave a brief statement to German television, saying that he did not see Mr. Putin’s act as staged. He declined to elaborate on his own part. “What is important is the result,” Mr. Genscher said. Ms. Merkel, commenting on Friday on Mr. Khodorkovsky’s release, said it was the result of “a window of possibilities.” She did not explain, but the phrasing suggested she was not only aware of the top-secret negotiations, but informed about their pace. It was not clear if her reference to a “window” was an allusion to the Winter Olympics in Sochi, which Mr. Putin sees as the prestige project of his presidency. Mr. Khodorkovsky said on Sunday that he thought his release was due in part to Sochi and Mr. Putin’s desire to burnish Russia’s image. Mr. Genscher is one of a cluster of older, experienced figures who enjoy great respect in Germany and remain well connected. Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who turned 95 on Monday, is another such figure. On a self-described farewell tour of various countries, he was in Moscow recently to see retired officials he knows from the Soviet era, and was then invited to meet Mr. Putin. The two discussed Russian-German ties, and how whether they are enemies, as in World War II, or on the same side, as in rejoicing in Napoleon’s defeat in Russia in 1812, they will always be dealing with each other, Mr. Schmidt said.
