They are taking no chances this time, re-signing the veteran left-hander Dámaso Marte to a three-year, $12 million contract on Wednesday. Marte, who turns 34 in February, joined the Yankees last July in a six-player trade with Pittsburgh that also brought outfielder Xavier Nady. The Yankees declined Marte’s $6 million option for 2009, but with the new contract they could have him through 2012 if they exercise a fourth-year option. Marte had a 5.40 earned run average in 25 games for the Yankees, but he struck out 24 batters in 18 1/3 innings. Over all, he averaged more than a strikeout per inning pitched, as he has done in seven of his last eight seasons. He has held left-handers to a .200 average in his career. Among left-handers, he trails only J. C. Romero in appearances over the last five seasons. The Yankees view Marte as more than a specialist, but they used him for less than an inning in 13 of his 25 appearances. Marte has held Boston’s David Ortiz to a .200 average (2 for 10), and Tampa Bay’s Carlos Peña has a .235 mark against him (4 for 17).

Coke showed an improved fastball and slider when he left a starting role for relief work in the minors, and he allowed just one earned run in 14 2/3 innings for the Yankees.

The Rockies received the right-handed reliever Huston Street, the left-handed starter Greg Smith and the promising outfielder Carlos González. The clubs reached a tentative agreement Monday, but had to wait for the results of physicals and other details to be worked out.

Any time you make a change, there’s a bit of an unknown.” Holliday, a  runner-up for the 2007 National League Most Valuable Player award, is to make $13.5 million next season, then will be eligible to be a free agent. (AP) UPTON HAS SHOULDER SURGERY Tampa Bay center fielder B. J. Upton had surgery on his left shoulder this week, and the Rays expect him to be ready by opening day. Dr. James Andrews performed the surgery Tuesday, Rays executive vice president for baseball operations Andrew Friedman said. Upton, 24, played much of the season with a sore shoulder — he throws right-handed — that affected his offensive production. He batted .288 with 7 homers and 16 runs batted in for the Rays in the postseason. Upton hit .273 with nine home runs in 531 at-bats in the regular season.
