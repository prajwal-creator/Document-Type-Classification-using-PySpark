Italy would not be Italy if there were not the scent of controversy and discontent in the air, but after an entire season in which Juventus has remained unbeaten in domestic games, who can claim this time that the title is undeserved? On Monday morning, Adriano Galliani, who runs A.C. Milan on behalf of Silvio Berlusconi, graciously called Andrea Agnelli, the relatively new, young president of Juventus. “Compliments,” Galliani said. “The title passes from us to you, without regret or remorse.” Bravo, Galliani. There are, inevitably, points of contention, disputed penalty calls, strangely disallowed goals that the Milan chief executive might have played up. But he said, and presumably Berlusconi will at some stage endorse, that finishing first in the league last year and second this season is not so bad. But like Juventus, his club now looks ahead to strengthening the side for the Champions League next season. Looking forward, rather than back, is a great idea. The fact is that Italian club soccer has a lot of ground to make up on Spain, England and Germany. Juventus triumphed this season largely through a driven effort by its coach, the former player Antonio Conte, and its extraordinarily hard-working, though not exotic, group of players.

But next season will bring the added dimension and the completely higher demands of competing in Europe.

The rhythms are different, and the players’ intensity gets disrupted. The Italian clubs struggle to switch priorities between midweek in Europe and weekends at home. The current Juventus squad would certainly be too slim, too stretched, against the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid or the two European finalists this year, Bayern Munich and Chelsea. So Conte, having come home to the Old Lady he served as a relentlessly intense midfielder, will have to go into the market for more quality. Agnelli, now in charge of La Juve in succession from his father, his uncle and his grandfather, has to find more money to complete, if he can, the transformation of the once-fallen club he inherited. “We have come from paradise to hell, and back to paradise,” the 36-year-old Agnelli said Monday. As he surveys the new stadium that Juventus ambitiously built while allowing Conte to rebuild the team almost completely, the president probably knows that the renovation is not yet complete. Conte will, of course, keep his job, and be one of the few Juve coaches to do so over the last turbulent decade. Andrea Pirlo, the 32-year-old playmaker who proved for Juventus that he was far from the spent force that his previous club, Milan, thought him to be, speaks of playing on for years and years to come.

Alessandro Del Piero, arguably the club’s most symbolic player of this transitional period, almost certainly will not be back. Now in his 37th year — 20 of them with Juventus — Del Piero still has artistry in his feet, but understandably less energy in his lungs.

On my part, there is a willingness to smile, there will be a time to discuss other things after.” He means, though he cannot bring himself to say it, life after Juventus.

Juventus, steeped in history and, despite everything, still Italy’s most followed club, has to reach a new level. No one can deny that the Old Lady has known more beautiful times. Her past boasts the wonders of Michel Platini, Zinédine Zidane and Roberto Baggio, and even further back in the ’50s, the side of Omar Sivori, “Big” John Charles and Giampiero Boniperti that was built under the patronage of Gianni Agnelli. Similarly, the Milan clubs, A.C. and Inter, were once more imperious than they are now. It is the cycle of life. Italy still lives and breathes soccer, or “calcio,” as any Italian would call it. But there is a recession on. The stadiums are not palaces anymore, aside from Juve’s enterprising move to build one. The industrial and political barons may have the same ambitions for their sport of sports, but even Gianni Agnelli once admitted to this writer: “I have been spoiled with great players, fine players, and maybe I have indulged too much.” Now his nephew indulges, against the still ambitious, though politically defeated, Berlusconi. Andrea Agnelli, however, feels unable to count the blessing of his first Serie A title and let go of the recent past. He talked Monday of continuing the legal fight to reclaim two titles that were stripped from Juventus six years ago. The president, players and officials of Juve still maintain that the 2005 and 2006 championships were won on the field and belong to them. Italy’s sports governors decreed otherwise. They found that Juventus and others, including A.C. Milan, were guilty to differing degrees of interfering with the appointment of referees in what became known as “Calciopoli,” the corruption trial of 2006.

Now that she is back on her feet, now that the Old Lady has new sons and players who are not under suspicion, it would seem this is the time to let go of the past. The team is winning. The house is likely to be the most profitable stadium in Italy, while others, owned by hard-pressed municipalities, are crumbling. The young Angelli might best follow the tone of Milan’s Galliani: no remorse, no regret, onwards we go.
