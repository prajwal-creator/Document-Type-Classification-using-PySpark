But from that modest beginning came an unusual series of investigations. Ultimately, those inquiries involved three different sets of prosecutors and several federal law enforcement agencies, and considered issues ranging from campaign financing laws to bribery statutes to Senate ethics rules. Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat, was not even a peripheral figure in the initial case. He soon moved to the center of the prosecutors' attention, though, becoming the target of one of the most intensive investigations in years of a sitting United States senator. Even then, federal prosecutors decided they would be hard pressed to prove the case they tried to build from the allegations of a wealthy political donor who said he had given Mr. Torricelli thousands of dollars in cash and gifts in return for help with international business deals.

Forrester -- finally took enough of a toll that he decided yesterday to abandon his embattled campaign.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       ''I can't be heard,'' he said. ''If I cannot be heard, then someone else must be heard.'' Although Mr. Torricelli has insisted he was unfairly made a target by overzealous prosecutors, the investigation in which he became ensnared started with little consideration of politics. It began even before Mr. Torricelli won election to the Senate in November 1996, as federal agents and prosecutors in Newark began to untangle a business fraud that a lawyer who was the Republican Party chairman in Bergen County, Berek P. Don, ultimately admitted in federal court. The investigators examining Mr. Don's records came upon a financial trail that stopped them cold, federal officials said. He had taken a check for $11,000 from an international businessman named David Chang, who had been one of his law clients. Mr. Don, despite his Republican politics, had funneled the money through several others to Mr. Torricelli's Senate campaign. The focus of the case began to shift soon thereafter. According to several federal officials, the desire of some lower-level prosecutors to examine whether Mr. Torricelli might have had any role in the illegal contribution set off a debate within the office of the United States attorney in Newark, Faith S. Hochberg. Those tensions became moot, however, when Mr. Torricelli championed Ms. Hochberg's nomination as a federal judge. She withdrew from the case, and it was handed over to a task force of the Justice Department that had been set up to investigate campaign-financing abuses that emerged from the 1996 election. At a time when Washington was churning with stories about dubious campaign contributions from wealthy Asian businessmen, the investigators paid particular attention to Mr. Chang. In 1995, Mr. Chang, a Korean-American entrepreneur, had sought the help of Mr. Torricelli, then a United States representative, in trying to recoup tens of millions of dollars he was owed for grain shipments to North Korea. He quickly become one of the lawmaker's most generous supporters.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The prosecutors tried to pressure Mr. Chang to cooperate. But even after his arrest on Dec. 10, 1999, his lawyer at the time, Michael Critchley, insisted in court that his client knew nothing of any wrongdoing by Mr. Torricelli or other politicians. (In a letter made public last week by a federal appeals court over the objections of Mr. Torricelli's lawyers, federal prosecutors stated that Mr. Chang originally hired Mr. Critchley on the senator's recommendation -- a claim that both men had previously denied.)

The inquiry then turned to members of the senator's campaign staff, who Mr. Chang claimed had helped him arrange some of his illegal donations. In the final days of the Clinton administration, federal officials said, senior Justice Department officials approved criminal indictments against three of Mr. Torricelli's closest campaign aides. According to a copy of the draft indictment, prosecutors planned to charge the aides with conspiring to violate federal election laws by disguising illegal campaign donations from Mr. Chang and others, and with filing false reports with election authorities. Lawyers for all three of the former aides denied that their clients had done anything improper or illegal. The proposed indictments were never voted on by the grand jury that was hearing evidence in the matter. Instead, they were shelved after the Bush administration decided to start dismantling the campaign task force and transferred the Torricelli case in early 2001 to the office of Mary Jo White, at the time the United States attorney in Manhattan. There, prosecutors focused directly on the evidence of possible wrongdoing by Mr. Torricelli himself. In their letter, which evaluated Mr. Chang's cooperation for the federal judge who gave him a reduced sentence of 18 months' imprisonment, the prosecutors said they were able to develop ''substantial corroborating evidence'' for his claims about lavish gifts and favors returned. Nonetheless, the prosecutors said they had only Mr. Chang's word to support most of his claims of having given cash to the senator. And they concluded that he had established such a record of deceit in his business dealings and other matters that his credibility problems ''would have completely undermined'' his testimony in any prosecution of Mr. Torricelli. When Ms. White decided against trying to bring criminal charges against Mr. Torricelli, she referred the case to the Senate Ethics Committee. After reviewing the evidence developed by federal investigators and hearing testimony from Mr. Torricelli, the panel ''severely admonished'' him on July 30 for accepting several gifts from Mr. Chang in violation of Senate rules.

''The bar has always been extremely high for the indictment and successful prosecution of a sitting member of Congress, and for good reason,'' said William B. Canfield, a former Republican counsel to the Senate ethics panel. ''But the people, in electing or defeating a candidate, don't have the same problem the Justice Department does,'' he said. ''They can look that person in the eye and if they don't like what they see, that's enough.''  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
