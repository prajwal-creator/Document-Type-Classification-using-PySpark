It was as close to a victory lap on the economy that Mr. Obama has taken. “It’s worth us every once in a while reflecting on the fact that the American economy is making real progress,” the president said, after ticking off a series of monthly and annual statistics for job growth that the American economy has not experienced since the 1990s. Among the criticisms leveled at the White House, by former administration officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill, is that Mr. Obama has not taken enough credit for the good things that have occurred on his watch. Nowhere has that reluctance been more evident than in his cautious reaction to a string of strong jobs reports. Despite the fact that the economy has added jobs for 57 straight months — the longest streak on record, Mr. Obama said on Friday — he has until now steadfastly avoided a triumphant tone. That is because the job growth has not been matched by wage growth, which has meant that many Americans are not feeling the benefits of the recovery.

In addition to a better-than-expected growth in the number of jobs, those workers’ average hourly wages rose 0.4 percent, twice what economists expected. While only a monthly number, it could suggest that wages are finally rebounding, too, which would put more cash in the pockets of working people.

And, as always, he conceded a lot of work remained. But he noted that the United States was now outperforming much of the world economically — a theme he emphasized at the Group of 20 summit meeting last month in Australia. “We’ve put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all other industrialized advanced countries combined,” the president said, “and we’re going to keep at it until every single American who is willing and able to work can find not just any job but a job that pays a decent wage and allows them to support their families.” The recovery has gained enough traction, White House officials say, that Mr. Obama can afford to shake off some of his ambivalence and make a robust case for how the accelerating job growth is likely to translate into higher wages.

Watch in Times Video »         embed            In a speech at Northwestern University before the midterm elections as well as at a White House news conference just after the vote and in remarks to corporate executives this week, Mr. Obama has laid out a more forceful case for a broad-gauge recovery, drawing parallels to the record-setting job creation of Bill Clinton’s presidency. Few leaders knew how to seize credit for good news like Mr. Clinton, fellow Democrats say nostalgically. In a speech at the White House in 1998, he hailed his first balanced budget as a “landmark achievement,” reaping enormous credit for fiscal responsibility. Having taken office during a prolonged recession, Mr. Obama has only recently been able to point to a half-decent economy. But critics say the White House has not made enough of another more promising development: the nation’s evolving energy independence — a product of the boom in domestic production of oil and natural gas.

The steep fall in gasoline prices, economists say, is tamping down inflation, which will make people’s paychecks go further. “There’s no question that the disconnect between the macroeconomy and middle-class lives is significant, and that gap hasn’t narrowed nearly as much as it should have,” said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was formerly chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   “But the acceleration in employment growth is real, significant and important,” he said, “and I have to believe people are feeling it, if not in their paychecks than in their job security.” For Mr. Obama, administration officials said, striking the right tone on the economy has been a constant balancing act. In remarks to corporate executives at the Business Roundtable on Wednesday, the president noted that corporate profits were fat. But in speeches to broader audiences, Mr. Obama notes that ordinary Americans continue to struggle. “Does the president being optimistic lead to further confidence in the economy and a sense of opportunity? Or does the president being optimistic sound discordant and cause people to lose faith that they’re going to get out of this?” Jennifer Palmieri, the White House communications director, asked. “That’s the balance we have to strike.” On Friday, as his nominee for defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, stood by him, Mr. Obama sounded as if he believed the balance had fallen clearly on the side of optimism. “If we can continue on this trajectory, if we can continue to grow robustly,” he said, “we can get a virtuous cycle that’s really going to make a difference and be a critical component of strengthening our national security, because national security starts with a strong economy here at home.”   A version of this article appears in print on December 6, 2014, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: After Jobs Report,Obama Takes a Little Credit.
