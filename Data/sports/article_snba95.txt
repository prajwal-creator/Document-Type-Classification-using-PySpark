Several sources familiar with it have said that the report's recommendations are meant to streamline the U.S.O.C.'s administration, improve its marketing capability and create a stronger financial support system for athletes in training. One recommendation, the sources said, would be that the U.S.O.C. headquarters in Colorado Springs be decentralized, with the administrative offices, including marketing and public relations, relocating to New York. The report might also recommend that the U.S.O.C. establish a higher profile in Washington to deal with Congress and the White House, the sources said. Foundation a Question One source said he expected the report to recommend the dissolution of the Olympic Foundation, which was created with the surplus from the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. The foundation maintains an investment portfolio worth approximately $160 million that is separate from the U.S.O.C.'s. Some of the money is invested in companies that operate in South Africa, a fact that has caused friction. But Col. F. Don Miller, the president of the foundation, said he did not expect anything in the committee report to affect the foundation.

''But I expect this will be a comprehensive report, and I fully expect that we will act on the recommendations.'' Yearlong Study  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The report is a result of a yearlong study undertaken by a committee headed by Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees, and its presentation Sunday is expected to be the highlight of the three-day session. Its contents have been kept secret by the eight committee members. ''I can't give any details now,'' Steinbrenner said in a recent telephone conversation. ''But it will be hard-hitting.'' Also on the agenda are the election of officers, a vote by the executive board to approve the four-year budget for 1989 to 1992, and ratification of a proposed drug-testing agreement between the U.S.O.C. and its counterpart in the Soviet Union. Steinbrenner, who for years has been a public-sector member of the executive board, has been nominated to become a vice president.

But this year, in addition to the committee's three nominees for vice president - Steinbrenner, Mike Lenard, a member of the Athletes Advisory Council; and William Tutt, a current vice president -Willye B. White, a long jumper in five Olympics, has been nominated through petition by six organizations represented on the executive board. Evie Dennis, a current vice president, who like White, is black, might also be nominated from the floor. Neither is expected to generate enough support to win, however. In that case, the U.S.O.C.'s six highest officials would be male and five of them white. The exception is LeRoy Walker, the former president of The Athletics Congress, whose nomination as U.S.O.C. treasurer is unopposed. He is black. The proposed budget reflects an increase in revenues of nearly $100 million over the last four years, due in large part expanded corporate sponsorships and television rights fees from the International Olympic Committee. Benefits for Programs The projected revenue through 1992 is $248.8 million. Among the programs that stand to benefit significantly from the proposed increase is money for athletes preparing for the Olympics. A new program would be created with $16.1 million over the four years that would enable up to 1,000 athletes per year to apply for as much as $2,500 apiece each year.

That increase would include a 48 percent increase, to $6 million, for drug testing over the four years. An agreement with the Soviet Union that would create the means by which medical experts in each country could test athletes in the other country at any time was to have been completed by this weekend. But Soviet officials canceled a trip to the United States during which the final details were to have been resolved. One foreign official who will attend the meetings is Juan Antonio Samaranch, the I.O.C. president, whose trip to the United States included stops in Atlanta, the American city bidding for the 1996 Summer Games, and Washington, where he met yesterday with President Bush.
