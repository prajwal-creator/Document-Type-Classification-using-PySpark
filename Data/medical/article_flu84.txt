My Kenya. By Elspeth Huxley. Illustrated. 262 pages. Viking. $18.95. EXPATRIATE women writing on Kenya - for some reason, the result has been exemplary literature: most notably Isak Dinesen's ''Out of Africa'' and ''Shadows on the Grass'' and Beryl Markham's ''West With the Night.'' Though Elspeth Huxley, a fiction writer and journalist who grew up in Kenya as the daughter of English pioneer farmers, does not possess Dinesen's fierce visionary style or even Markham's funny-wise way with a story, she, too, has written eloquently about her experiences in Kenya, and her charming memoirs (''The Flame Trees of Thika'' and ''The Mottled Lizard'') have provided readers with a closely observed picture of life in that former British colony. ''Out in the Midday Sun,'' which more or less takes up where those earlier volumes left off, begins by giving us a portrait of Kenya in the years between the wars, then moves on to outline the growing black-white tensions that would lead to the Mau Mau violence of the early 1950's and eventually to the country's independence in 1963. But while politics obviously enters the picture - there is even an extended section here on Jomo Kenyatta's emergence and evolution as a leader - the tone and impetus of the book is nostalgic, not judgmental. Mrs. Huxley simply wants to memorialize a time and place, and in weaving together strains of her own reminiscence with historical asides and even bits of folklore, she creates a shimmering picture of a now vanished world. What is so startling to realize is just how swiftly change and modernity came to Kenya, indeed to that entire continent. As Mrs. Huxley points out, traditional Kikuyu culture, which had remained unchanged for centuries, came into collision with white mores relatively late: fears of poisoned arrows kept trading expeditions and explorers on the margins of Kikuyuland until the early years of this century; and in the late 30's, Mrs. Huxley was able to interview village elders who ''could remember at first hand, not from hearsay, what tribal life was like before white men came along to disturb and then disrupt it.'' Less than a century ago, she adds, a visitor could have seen slaves loaded aboard a ship ''to be packed in layers, one atop the other so there would have been no room to move.'' And within the space of a lifetime, frontier conditions - rivaling anything found in our own wild, wild West - would give way to the comforts and moral dilemmas of our technological age. Certainly as recounted by Mrs. Huxley, the hardships endured by the settlers of her parents' generation were daunting ones: locusts, killing cold waves, bouts with smallpox, flu and the plague and occasional encounters with tribal warriors with ''spear-blooding murders'' on their minds. Men and women trekked miles over mountains to reach their destinations, and children were frequently born in ox carts and isolated huts.

There is Gilbert Colvile, an old Etonian, who became a cattle rancher and a sort of honorary Masai. An expert hunter, he reportedly killed more than 250 lions and traveled about ''with a Maasai herdsman clutching a spear in the front seat of his car.'' A British officer named John Llewellyn also insisted on traveling in the bush in style - ''clean plates for each course, polished glasses, coffee cups''; and his successor, Maj. H. B. Sharpe, is seen floating downstream ''under an awning doing a crossword puzzle while the paddlers kept up a monotonous chant.''

''Indifference to what others think is, of course, the badge of the aristocrat. Never mind the Joneses, I make my own rules. Also there was reaction against convention, and adoption of a set of priorities in which respectability and tidiness came low on the list. What Karen Blixen (no lover of the British) called 'the fearful living death of English middle-class mediocrity' was, to such people, more to be dreaded than physical death on the horns of buffalo or in the jaws of a lion.''

Rather, it makes us appreciate the peculiar mixture of courage, rashness, perseverance, idealism and opportunism that brought such a varied group of people to this beautiful, dangerous land. Kenya, after all, was a frontier, and like all frontiers, it became a magnet for all manner of adventurers, missionaries, con men and visionaries who dreamed of starting a new life here under the hot equatorial sun. Some, like Clarence Buxton, had imperialist notions of turning the Masai and other tribes into new world Europeans. Some, like Elizabeth Cross, who'd arrived in Mombasa fresh from nursing service in World War I, sought an opportunity to exercise their newly discovered skills of self-reliance and courage. And some, like Mrs. Huxley's parents, simply cherished a dream of starting and maintaining a farm. Whether or not they were able to achieve their dreams, most of these people stayed on (at least through independence); and whatever their initial reasons for coming, they stayed on - as Mrs. Huxley persuasively demonstrates - because they fell in love with the land.
