A referendum seeking financing for a new arena will be held Monday.   Credit Christopher Pasatieri/Getty Images     Uniondale, N.Y. How much is a hockey team worth? Is it worth $58 a household in a county that may cut bus service ? How much is nostalgia worth in a county that just voted to cut 128 jobs ? Questions about priorities are always worth asking before the public agrees to build new facilities for team owners. The questions seem particularly vital as Nassau County holds a bond referendum on Monday that seems jiggered to produce a new arena for the Islanders . Hard-core fans with long memories and hard-hat construction workers with short hopes for work may find their way to vote Monday. Polls suggest a broader swath of the population does not want to subsidize a new arena but may not make it to the booths for a craftily timed Monday vote on the first day of steamy August. If echoes could vote, the bond issue would be a shoo-in. The Islanders won four Stanley Cups from the spring of 1980 to the spring of 1983 and were just about the best team I ever covered .

But the Islanders’ day was nearly three decades ago.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story        Since then, they have had a series of inept and underfinanced owners, leading to the current owner, Charles Wang , a builder who has not yet shown any talent for running a sports franchise. Yet Nassau County’s current administration is supporting a bond plan to build a $350 million arena as well as a $50 million minor league ballpark. The evidence is that Nassau County is no place for young athletes. The New York Nets, who won championships at Nassau Coliseum when it was less obsolete, unloaded Julius Erving from nearby Roosevelt, and are still wandering the earth for penance. Hofstra, my alma mater, had several eras of excellent football but was hemorrhaging money and gave up the sport before last season. In a better time, the Islanders gave a semblance of identity to this part of Long Island, best known for Charles A. Lindbergh’s takeoff for Paris on a damp morning in May 1927. When the Islanders won four straight Cups, celebrations were held in parking lots and mundane Hempstead Turnpike, but nobody honks for them anymore.

People work two jobs, sit in traffic, suffer the Long Island Railroad, and brood about taxes and budget cuts in their school districts. Skilled workers who fix things at our house muse about moving out of state, and good luck to that. Overpriced homes sit on the market; young people rent or settle for less; the county’s finances are currently under the review of a state oversight board. Does this sound like a county that should be skittering deeper onto the thin ice of hockey finances ? The Islanders molder, like a suburban house whose owners cannot afford the upkeep. Wang tried to link the residual affection for a vanished team with a grandiose $3.8 billion Lighthouse project for an arena and urban center with housing and transportation. Now he just wants Nassau to pass a bond to build a new arena, and he promises to pay the cost over-runs. Wise heads are telling him to post a performance bond. Normally, I am on the side of public projects. I’m all for high-speed railroads and repairing the infrastructure, but not so sure about an arena for a hockey team. This proposal reminds me of how New York City lobbied to host the 2012 Summer Olympics based on building an all-purpose stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. The Olympic powers rejected it, rightfully so. All the evidence tells me that big-box arenas and stadiums are often a mom-and-pop proposition for jobs and create dead spaces, just like Nassau Coliseum.

Their figures and logic seem suspect, based on an average attendance of 14,650. Last season’s attendance was 11,059, the worst in the N.H.L. There are alternatives. The voters could turn down the bond, and Wang could move the franchise. Or he could sell it to potential owners in Hamilton or Saskatoon or Quebec. (The highlight of last season was a visit by more than 1,000 Nordiques fans who took their enthusiasm across the border.) Or the league could find a buyer who could induce confidence for a new era on Long Island.  Plus, there is already plenty of hockey in the New York area, with the price-gouging Rangers in Midtown Manhattan and the Devils in downtown Newark, both accessible by train from Long Island — which the Islanders are not. The paradox is that the preoccupation with the federal budget crisis and the usual summer lassitude could keep most county residents from voting. Yet many residents wonder if this bond is practical for a team that has surely seen better days — and a county administration and team ownership that never have.
