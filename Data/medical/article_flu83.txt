International flu watchers detected it in China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong. The experts named it A/Taiwan for the place where the standard sample, or reference strain, was captured. There was no way of knowing just how dangerous it would be. By the end of spring the virus had spread across the Pacific, appearing widely in the islands of Micronesia and possibly in Australia and New Zealand as well. Like typical flu viruses, it seemed to travel erratically and with amazing speed. As it moved, its course was tracked by the international surveillance network sponsored by the World Health Organization. Isolated cases occurred in Hawaii in June, in Syracuse, N.Y., by mid-September and in Houston in October. The first real flu outbreak in this country came in late October, hitting about 50 Naval personnel in Key West, Fla. But, almost as soon as the new virus appeared in the continental United States, vaccine against it was being dispatched to doctors throughout the country. For while the virus flowed silently, invisibly across half the world, manufacturers in this country had been racing to make a vaccine to cope with it.

It used to take as long as six months to produce, test and distribute an influenza vaccine, but new tests and many other improved techniques have cut this to about 90 days, experts say.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       ''The reason this strain was identified as being important for a vaccine was that it was a lot different from last year's,'' said Dr. Gerald Quinnan, head of the virology division of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drugs and Biologics, the Federal agency that approves vaccines and the processes for manufacturing them. The fact that the virus was different implied that many people would lack immunity to A/Taiwan and that it might cause much illness, the typical spectrum of flu including cough, fever, sore muscles, headache, weariness, sometimes leading to pneumonia, prostration and even death. The new virus was expected to attack most commonly children and adults under the age of 35. There are two main types of flu virus, A and B, and these have many subtypes. Viruses of type A are notoriously changeable. They have caused major epidemics and sometimes worldwide outbreaks, or pandemics, when their chemistry shifts suddenly so that most humans lack immunity to the new form. The main vaccine against flu for 1986 contains killed virus of three different types and is therefore called trivalent. Before summer it had already been produced by three manufacturers in this country, Wyeth Laboratories, Connaught Laboratories and Parke-Davis, a unit of the Warner-Lambert Company. The vaccine was made from a B virus, isolated early this year in Michigan and named B/Ann Arbor, and two A viruses: A/Chile, found in 1983, and A/ Mississippi, a 1985 virus. It took a special effort, but all three manufacturers produced a monovalent vaccine against A/Taiwan in time for the flu season, which usually begins in late fall. The vaccine is becoming available in time to help protect high-risk groups and others who want to use it against this winter's flu, Dr. Quinnan said. Groups at High Risk According to a spokesman for Wyeth, quick distribution poses no major problems. The manufacturers know in advance the doctors, health groups and agencies that will want vaccine and alert them that the product is available. For Americans in general, Dr. Quinnan said, use of the trivalent vaccine should have the higher priority, but young people in two high-risk groups should take the Taiwan vaccine as well. These groups are people under 35 years of age who have chronic heart or lung disease and people in the same age group who are institutionalized for any major medical condition.

It is among them that flu most often leads to death. For younger, healthy people the flu viruses encountered over the last several decades have seldom been fatal. But, even among previously healthy people, flu can be incapacitating for days or even a few weeks. Dr. Quinnan said there were about 80 million Americans altogether in high-risk groups for whom the vaccines are most urgently recommended. In recent years, about 20 million Americans have taken flu vaccine each season, he said. Vaccine Effective for the Season According to Dr. Thomas Torok of the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, there are estimated to be 15 million Americans in the two groups for whom the A/Taiwan vaccine is most highly recommended. The centers, which have one of the W.H.O. main reference laboratories for study and identification of flu viruses, coordinate flu surveillance efforts throughout the United States.

But natural infection with a flu virus may confer some protection for years against future attack by a similar virus. Indeed, the fact that A/Taiwan seems to attack the young most readily suggests that older Americans encountered something like it more than three decades ago and have kept some residual immunity. The varieties of influenza A viruses are determined by the identities of two proteins on their surfaces. One is a hemagglutinin, a substance thought to be important in helping the virus invade human cells. The other, a neuraminidase, seems to have several important functions, including helping newly formed viruses break out of the human cells in which they were produced. While all influenza A viruses have the two proteins on their surfaces, the chemistry of each of the two varies among different viruses. There are three known hemagglutinins in human A type viruses, H1, H2 and H3. There are two neuraminidases, N1 and N2. These same proteins determine a person's immunity to the virus. It is against them that the body's immune defense system produces protective antibodies. A vaccine against an H3N2 virus will not protect against H1N1. But there can also be minor variations so that this year's H1N1 virus may require a vaccine different from last year's. When Epidemics Are Likely Although many types of flu virus can infect humans, animals and birds, Dr. Quinnan said the disease toll from influenza A for the last 100 years had been mainly the work of just three fundamental varieties: H1N1, H3N2 and H2N2. They are given place names and years indicating where and when their reference strains were found. Thus, the new virus is called A/Taiwan/86, while one of the viruses in the trivalent vaccine is A/Chili/83. When one major variety of influenza A virus overtakes and replaces another as the main flu virus in circulation in the world, public health experts have learned to expect major epidemics or, sometimes, even a pandemic. Such a major change in the identity of the virus is called an antigenic shift. The most recent occurred in 1977, when the Russian flu, an H1N1 virus, appeared after almost a decade in which H3N2 had been the main flu problem. However, H3N2 also stayed in circulation, and several varieties of both, as well as influenza B, have continued to assault humans ever since.

It is this more subtle change that has produced A/Taiwan. It is still an H1N1 virus, but enough different from others so that the experts decided a new vaccine against H1N1 virus was needed to supplement that made against the H1N1 version found in Chile in 1983. The decision was made July 25 by Federal public health experts after a meeting with expert advisers at the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drugs and Biologics in Bethesda, Md. Manufacturers Had Samples Almost a month before that, Dr. Don Metzgar, vice president for operations of Connaught, said, special couriers from the F.D.A. had sent the manufacturers small glass ampules containing samples of the A/Taiwan virus. He said specialists at his company had immediately started growing small lots of the virus in eggs in which chick embryos had been growing for 11 days. All three manufacturers needed to move as fast as possible in case a new vaccine was recommended. The manufacturers were notified of the decision the day it was made. Connaught's timetable from then on illustrates how urgent the task was for all three manufacturers. ''We ordered eggs that day,'' Dr. Metzgar said. Vaccine makers at his company normally use 100,000 to 120,000 eggs a day, seven days a week, until they have produced enough vaccine to fill their estimated needs, he said. The manufacturers consider total production to be trade secrets. On Aug. 4, Connaught submitted to the F.D.A. the ''seed virus'' from which the company hoped to produce vaccine. Dr. Quinnan's unit approved it Aug. 7. On the Way by Oct. 27 The company produced its first vaccine by Aug. 10 and submitted it immediately to the F.D.A. The first batch was approved Oct. 22, Dr. Metzgar said, and was on its way to customers by Oct. 27. Because the emergence of A/Taiwan is considered to be a result of antigenic drift, not an antigenic shift, most experts do not predict extraordinary trouble from the virus this year. Nevertheless, flu is notoriouly unpredictable. ''I don't think we will really know what the risk is until we see what happens this winter,'' said Dr. Quinnan.
