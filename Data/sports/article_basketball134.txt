The Mac Irvin Fire, the eponymous Amateur Athletic Union program consisting of players from middle school to high school, were doing lay-up drills on four basketball hoops. Coaches and players’ parents crammed the sidelines. Some were once Irvin’s players. It has been almost two decades since Irvin helped usher summer-club basketball into Chicago. In 1992, he organized a team that toured the area’s top high school talent at the time — led by the twin towers of Tommy Hamilton, 7 feet 2 inches tall, and Rashard Griffith, 7 feet tall — around the country. Hamilton went on to a journeyman career in the N.B.A., while Griffith starred at the University of Wisconsin and plays professionally in Europe. Irvin is widely considered the high priest of Chicago A.A.U. ball, the gatekeeper to millions of dollars worth of player potential, and a mentor in the nebulous — at times shady — world of elite youth sport. Others have come and gone, and club basketball has seen many transitions since Irvin, a former regional affirmative-action director at Xerox, started this hardwood side project, but the Irvin name has carried on — an impressive feat of longevity in a particularly cutthroat business.

While the program has always been a major player, it hasn’t always been the most dominant force. For the last decade, even as Irvin sent players to Division I basketball in most years, an A.A.U. team named the Illinois Warriors had the best track record for sending its players to the N.B.A. Other local teams, like the Illinois Wolves, Mean Streets and the Derrick Rose All-Stars have made significant inroads into the marketplace. But as corporate sponsorship of traveling basketball programs has dwindled in recent years, the Mac Irvin Fire, two years into a contract with Nike, seeks to corner the emerging bull market of talent in Chicago, led by a strong class of 2011 players. “He gave birth to what is summer basketball in the city of Chicago,” said Sonny Vaccaro, a chief originator of the summer youth circuit. Vaccaro, who made his name representing Nike and Adidas in grass-roots basketball, linked up with Irvin in the 1980s when Vaccaro began his summer camps designed to showcase the elite high school players on a single stage.

Four years ago, he and his son Mike began what many see as an imprudent push into ever-younger age ranks. In an effort to meet the desire of college basketball coaches to identify elite talent at an increasingly young age, the Irvins started making the rounds at middle-school games.

The Irvins happened upon then-eighth graders Michael Shaw, now a 6-foot-8 star at De La Salle High School, and Wayne Blackshear, a 6-foot-5 guard who plays at Morgan Park High School, where Nick Irvin is the coach. They are among the top 20 nationally in the 2011 class. “We sat down and said this class can be better than 1979,” said Mike Irvin, referring to the group of Chicago players who included three McDonald’s All-Americans, led by Isaiah Thomas. “What Michael and Mac have been able to do is get young ones so they won’t lose them to poachers,” Vaccaro said. “In old days, you always worried about a superstar going from Team A to Team B. If you have him since sixth grade, you build camaraderie. They were five years ahead.” In addition to its highly-valued group of 17-year-olds, the Fire also boasts two of the top high school freshmen players in the country: Jabari Parker and Thomas Hamilton Jr., both of whose fathers played for Irvin. Not everyone thinks highly of the Irvins. Chief among the program’s detractors is Larry Butler, former coach of the Illinois Warriors, who left the Chicago A.A.U. basketball scene last year after a falling-out with Nike. Butler’s departure corresponded with the Fire’s linking with Nike. In the mid-1990s, Butler joined with Irvin under the umbrella of the Warriors. “I had the players and Mac Irvin had the contract,” he said, referring to the clothing deal Irvin then had with Adidas. Butler said that after he unsuccessfully lobbied Adidas to sponsor his own squad, independently of Irvin’s, he bolted for Nike in 1996 and took the Illinois Warriors with him. “The Irvins have never dominated,” Butler said. “I dominated the state in terms of players for over 10 years.” Mac Irvin is unruffled by the criticisms of Butler and others. “That’s Chicago,” he said, “and maybe a few other places where people hate people who are doing well. I’ve been in this for too many years, and it’s always something. You are going to get attacked — that’s when you are doing well. When you are doing nothing? You don’t have to worry about a thing.”   A version of this article appears in print on May 7, 2010, on Page A19B of the National edition with the headline: A Basketball Program Rises by Dipping Lower.
