With six relatives depending on his meager income, Mr. Lopez, 22, says it was getting harder and harder to keep everyone's stomach full. ''I didn't want to leave home, but if I stayed, my family would go hungry,'' he said. So it came as a pleasant surprise when, a day after his arrival in the city, Mr. Lopez was offered $250 a week to work at a grocery in the East Village, Wa Fruit and Vegetable Market on 14th Street near Avenue A. The job -- bundling flowers, shucking corn and arranging piles of apples -- requires minimal English and no special skills. ''When I found this job, I thought, 'I am a lucky man,' '' he said in Spanish. But it did not take long before Mr. Lopez's enthusiasm for his new job waned. While his salary is far more than he could ever make back home, it is earned by his working 13-hour days, six days a week. Last winter, when he came down with the flu, he said, he had to show up for work anyway because his boss does not pay employees when they are out sick. ''If I ever took off a few days, I would come back to find someone else in my job,'' he said with a laugh as he emptied sweet peas from their pods. Labor organizers say working conditions at the city's Korean-owned markets, like the one that employs Mr. Lopez, are among the worst in New York. According to Local 169 of Unite, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, the Mexican men who stock shelves and keep the fruit meticulously displayed work an average of 72 hours a week and earn less than $3.50 an hour, well below the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. None enjoy benefits like health insurance or paid vacation.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The shop owners, however, say they cannot afford to pay their employees more. ''If they want to work eight hours a day, they can,'' said the manager of Wa Fruit and Vegetable Market, who declined to give his name. ''But of course, they will make less.'' It is illegal for employers to pay their workers less than $5.15 an hour, and violators can be fined up to 200 percent of the unpaid wages. But because state labor officials do not keep detailed statistics it is impossible to know the extent of the problem among greengrocers. Long overlooked by organized labor, those who work at the city's greengrocers are finally drawing union attention. Last May, Local 169 began a unionization drive with help from the Lower East Side Community Labor Coalition and the Mexican-American Workers Project. So far, Jerry Dominguez, the project's full-time organizer, has spoken to hundreds of workers throughout the city.

Although none of the grocers have yet to recognize the union, organizers are turning up the heat. On Sept. 16, they held a boisterous march that wound through the East Village, stopping at a half-dozen produce stores along the way. The crowd of 100 people, led by a rousing mariachi band, shouted ''No justice, no peas,'' and ''fresh fruit, rotten wages'' as they scolded shop owners or store managers, many of whom appeared not to understand what was being said. Many, like Hae Nim Chun, the owner of Super Value, at 229 Avenue B, simply smiled and thanked a protester who lectured him.  If the effort to negotiate higher wages and shorter hours fails, Noah Zatz of the Community Labor Coalition said boycotts are not out of the question. ''These stores depend on neighborhood support to survive,'' he said. ''I think we have quite a bit of leverage here.'' The group, which also offers free English classes to the workers, is trying to make the Lower East Side an area where every business complies with the law. But Jay Shon, assistant director of the Korean Produce Association of New York, which represents 2,000 shop owners, warned that unionization would destroy an industry that he says is already foundering. Government cutbacks to food stamp recipients, rising commercial rents and increasing competition from supermarkets and others have hurt the business, he said. ''These are small stores, with two or three workers, and still there are places closing all the time,'' he said. ''The owners work hard too, and they don't have health insurance either.'' Union officials, however, say that stiff competition or declining profits is no excuse for exploitive labor practices. ''We don't want to drive anyone out of business,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''We just want them to obey the law.'' He said that most customers would be willing to pay more if they knew that workers were receiving minimum wage. ''That's the way American society works,'' he said, adding that the union's goal was to organize all the stores in a given neighborhood at the same time so no one shop gains an advantage over the others. Still, the unionizing effort has been hamstrung by widespread fear among the workers, most of whom arrived illegally. Some say they have been threatened with firing if they join; others worry that employers might report them to immigration authorities. ''The Italian and Jewish garment workers who organized earlier this century at least had the benefit of citizenship,'' said Immanuel Ness, a professor of political science at Brooklyn College who is writing a book on low-wage immigrant labor. He said many employers prefer to hire Mexican immigrants, because they consider them hardworking and willing to accept low wages. One store owner said he liked Mexicans because ''they don't make trouble.'' As the weather turns cold, Miguel Lopez is bracing himself for the misery of working outdoors at the Wa market. ''The trick is to keep moving,'' he said. Although he chats amiably when Mr. Dominguez stops by to talk up the union, he worries that joining it may bring him more harm than good by putting his job in jeopardy. ''At least here I don't get yelled at by my boss,'' he said, glancing warily over his shoulder. He did, however, agree that his life would be better if he worked less and made more money. One of his co-workers, a Mexican who has been at the store for nearly five years, makes $400 a week. ''If I could make that much, I would be very happy,'' he said.
