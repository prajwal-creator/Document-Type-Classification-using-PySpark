Specialty shops along Fulton evoke Latin America.   Credit Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times     IN August, Debra Kayman bought her first home, a two-family on Ashford Street in Cypress Hills, in the East New York section of Brooklyn . She came to the United States from Trinidad and Tobago in 1985, living in East Flatbush with family until her move to Cypress Hills in 1988. There she rented a succession of apartments, including one on Arlington Avenue near the stately Arlington branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, built a century ago by the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. Ms. Kayman’s house, which consists of a four-bedroom owner unit and a two-bedroom rental, cost $424,831; she lives there with her fiancé and her 13-year-old daughter, and works in Fort Greene as an education assistant for the New York City Board of Education. She has never considered leaving Cypress Hills, despite East New York’s reputation for crime —  a reputation reinforced last month when the Police Department identified the precinct that includes East New York as one of three with the biggest increase in robberies. Ms. Kayman says she has never felt unsafe. On the contrary, she enjoys browsing the specialty shops along Fulton Street, with their foods and merchandise evoking the richness of distant countries whose immigrants make up much of the community: Ecuador, El Salvador, Guyana.

But the specter of that past still lingers, especially among longtime residents and activists, who are only now beginning to see a return on their investment.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       “When we go back two decades ago,” said Assemblyman Darryl C. Towns, a lifelong resident whose district includes Cypress Hills, “there were issues in regard to public safety, the infrastructure was crumbling. But we have solidly turned that around, and there is a vibrant new feeling out here in this area. It’s no longer a community of last resort. It’s a community of choice.” Among the agents of change is the Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation , founded in 1983. It is responsible for more than 300 units of affordable housing, and has 200 more units now in progress, said Michelle Neugebauer, the corporation’s  executive director. Ms. Kayman is one who has benefited. Her home would have cost an additional $140,000 without subsidies from the city and the local group. It also works with merchants to improve the retail corridor along Fulton Street, and collaborated with the city Department of Education to create a new school, Public School 89 Cypress Hills , which opened in September and serves students through Grade 8. “It’s always been a first-homeownership kind of place,” said Bishop David Benke, an activist who since 1974 has been the pastor of St. Peter’s Lutheran Church on Highland Place. “A lot of people come here wanting to push their kids through school, people who want the best for their families. They’re first- or second-generation immigrants, and the young-adult crowd that follows is usually very dedicated to family.” His more than 30 years in Cypress Hills have provided glimpses of this ethic from a previous era — German and Irish immigrants who once, he says, operated an abundance of ice cream shops in the neighborhood — as well as among the currently dominant Latinos. Lance Wenceslao, 65, who was born and raised in the area in a Catholic family, said the Cypress Hills of his youth, “quiet and bare,” had become “a far more vibrant Hispanic neighborhood.” Mr. Wenceslao retired to Georgia in 2002, but only recently put his house on the market; his grown children lived in it after he moved. The colonial, on Barbey Street, is listed at $400,000.

Although neighborhood contours are often a subject of contention, its boundaries are described by the Encyclopedia of New York City and the Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation as the Queens border to the north, Atlantic Avenue to the south, Pennsylvania Avenue to the west and Eldert Lane to the east. From the vantage point of Jamaica Avenue, the expanse of cemeteries to the north, with Queens on its far side, offers views of mausoleums, headstones and markers, along with huge brick arches and abandoned buildings. As Bishop Benke put it, “Our neighbors to the north are very quiet.” Fulton Street is a mix of barber and beauty shops, bodegas and storefront churches beneath the rusted yellow elevated tracks of the J and Z trains. Latino restaurants proliferate as one moves eastward: takeout joints; sprawling seafood places advertising Saturday-night karaoke; Salvadoran pupuserías, where men gather over a lunchtime Presidente beer to the soundtrack of unwatched Univision soap operas. Eventually, the tracks diverge from Fulton Street and begin a northward curve, giving riders a close-up of the cornices of otherwise anonymous buildings. “We’re starting to see a lot of redevelopment of our commercial strips, making it more exciting and viable for the next generation of homeowners,” said Assemblyman Towns, noting that Cypress Hills was not yet a “Starbucks community.” (While residents elsewhere might wish for fewer Starbucks outlets, Mr. Towns implied that if one arrived, it would be a key marker of progress; he noted with pride that the local Dunkin’ Donuts offers WiFi.) The development corporation occupies several storefronts along Fulton Street, and has helped bring in businesses like a day care center and a sporting goods store.

Solis opened a new franchise of Los Taxes, a tax preparation company with a mostly Hispanic clientele, in one of the development corporation’s Fulton Street buildings. Mr. Solis, who lives in Queens and has worked in Cypress Hills for about 15 years, recalled more dangerous days. “I had the cellphone number for a D.A. in the narcotics division,” he said, adding that in the 1990s he would alert the official to suspicious activity. To speak to residents and business owners is to hear stories of progress made, work yet to be done and protectiveness of the community’s image. “We had to work to better the neighborhood,” said Wilson Piña,  who owns a travel agency, the Atlas Travel Group, as well as the Highland Driving School. He cited the variety of restaurants, affordable shopping and convenient transportation as reasons people are increasingly willing to stay. “This is not a bad neighborhood,” he said. “This is a good neighborhood.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   WHAT YOU’LL PAY “It’s such a diverse area, in terms of housing types,” said Raymond Parasmo, a broker with Fillmore Real Estate. In the southern portion, blocks are lined with attached houses; as one travels north, the land inclines and detached houses become more common, including large ones near Highland Park, bordered by metal fences or brick walls. Single-family houses are priced from $275,000 to $350,000, brokers say, and two-families start around $400,000. Houses tend to linger  four to six months, as they did last year, said Cirilo Rodriguez, a broker with Charles Rutenberg Realty. Recent buyers have been from the Dominican Republic and Ecuador. Rentals are scarce, said Lassaad Messai of Best Way Home Realty. Some can be found in multifamily homes, one-bedroom units for about $1,000 and two-bedrooms for about $1,250. Mark Kerr, an agent with Fillmore Real Estate, said prices in Cypress Hills and surrounding areas were down 15 to 20 percent over the last year or so. THE COMMUTE The J and Z trains serve Cypress Hills; commuting to Midtown Manhattan takes about 50 minutes. Area buses include the 56, along Jamaica Avenue, and the 24, along Atlantic Avenue. WHAT TO DO The Arlington branch of the Brooklyn Public Library went up in 1907, one of the original libraries built by Carnegie. The split-level building has various wooden staircases leading to reading rooms, one of which has a nonfunctioning brick fireplace. The 141-acre Highland Park has tennis courts and a synthetic turf field for football and soccer that opened in 2009. THE SCHOOLS Elementary schools in the general area include Public School 108 Sal Abbracciamento , through Grade 5. Last year 39.1 percent of fourth graders met standards in English and 66.4 percent in math, versus 45.6 and 58.4 citywide.

Nineteen percent of eighth graders met standards in English, 18.5 percent in math, versus 37.5 and 46.3 citywide. Franklin K. Lane High School , on Jamaica Avenue in Woodhaven, Queens, serves Grades 9 through 12. SAT averages last year were 353 in reading, 379 in math and 341 in writing, versus 439, 462 and 434 citywide. THE HISTORY About 380,000 people are interred in Cypress Hills Cemetery , according to “Cypress Hills Cemetery,” by Stephen C. Duer and Allan B. Smith, published in September. Among them are Mae West and Jackie Robinson.
