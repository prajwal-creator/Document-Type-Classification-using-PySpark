They will also learn about career opportunities, music, drugs and the need to stay in school and the problems of teen-age pregnancy. ''We want to provide a high work ethic and cultivate the inherent skills that light the way to success,'' aid Karl Walden, a Bridgeport resident who helped develop the camp last year with John Bagley, a seven-year veteran of the National Basketball association. Mr. Bagley -- who grew up in Bridgeport, played guard at Boston College and was drafted by the Cleveland Cavalilers before being traded to the New Jersey Nets -- and Mr. Walden, a childhood friend, say the camp tries to provide the youths with lessons on how to get the most out of life. The program combines athletics, music and academics in a seting where the youths can interact with positive role models, Mr. Walden said. It is one of the only camps in Connecticut run by a professional basketball player that seek to offer more than an athletic playground.  Only Two in the State   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   He said the only other summer basketball camp in Connecticut that is run by a professional player is at Quinnipiac College in Hamden. That camp is operated by Calvin Murphy, a former guard with the Houston Rockets and a native of Norwalk. Several colleges in the state hold basketball camps, and Warren G. Harding High School in Bridgeport conducts one, but none offer as broad a curriculum as the Bagley-Walden camp, Mr. Walden said.

Mr. Walden, who is a personnel manager at the Private Industry Council in Bridgeport, a Federally supported job training and referral agency, said several non-sports professionals would visit the camp and offer advice on career opportunities to the youths. ''Kids need to see a little bit more,'' Mr. Bagley said. The camp, which runs until Friday, is open to boys and girls from 8 to 15 years old and costs $75 a person. Scholarships for need are offered. The foundation, which Mr. Bagley and Mr. Walden incorporated this year, is seeking additonal financing to extend the camp this year and establish a year-round program for city youths.

That clinic is open to youths up to age 18.  A Nutritionist and a Counselor ''We'll have recreation for them; there will be a nutritionist there and an education counselor,'' Mr. Walden said. ''Everything will be organized at the university and one of the lecture halls.''    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
