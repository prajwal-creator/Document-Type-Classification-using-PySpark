Making only his fourth international start for the senior national team, Altidore connected in the 13th, 71st and 89th minutes, all three times off passes from Landon Donovan. Altidore, a 19-year-old forward and an increasingly important part of the United States roster, also scored as a substitute in the 77th minute last Saturday to start the American team’s comeback from a two-goal deficit in a 2-2 tie at El Salvador. He has six goals in nine international appearances. “It’s pretty cool,” Altidore said. “Most important is we came out, and the guys rebounded from the El Salvador game, and we made a statement.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Altidore eclipsed the mark for youngest hat trick set in 2004 by 20-year-old Eddie Johnson as a substitute in a 6-0 win over Panama in the semifinals of qualifying.

Costa Rica (2-1) is next with six after a 1-0 victory over visiting El  Salvador. Mexico (1-2) continued to struggle away from home, losing at Honduras, 3-1. United States Coach Bob Bradley made four changes to his starting lineup and used an offensive formation. He dropped DaMarcus Beasley from midfield to left back in place of Heath Pearce, started Brian Ching and Altidore up front, and left Donovan (left) and Clint Dempsey (right) in advanced midfield roles. With Beasley roaming up, it resembled a 4-3-3 at times.

Before becoming the coach, Maradona  backed Bolivia’s campaign against a FIFA ban on matches at high altitude. The ban was later overturned. Argentina has 19 points after 12 games, two fewer than  Brazil, which defeated  Peru, 3-0, with two first-half goals from Luis Fabiano. Paraguay leads the group with 24 points.

Spain has a maximum 18 points from six games in Group 5, 6 more than Bosnia-Herzegovina. England leads Group 6 with 15 points, 5 more than Croatia, which won, 2-0, in Andorra. Belarus beat Kazakhstan, 5-1, in the other group match. Italy leads Group 8 with 14 points from six games, 2 more points than Ireland.

North Korea claimed three players had food poisoning. The revelation came after South Korea won, 1-0. South Korea leads Asian Group B with 11 points, 1 ahead of North Korea and Saudi Arabia and with a game in hand.
