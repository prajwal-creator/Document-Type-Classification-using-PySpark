The teams, which were cut this fall to help close a $750 million budget gap,  should be back on the fields and in the gyms to begin practice as early as next  week. They will be financed in part by corporate grants, including $100,000 from Nike Inc., the sports equipment and shoe manufacturer. Other corporate contributions and $350,000 from the Board of Education were enough to restart the program. Restoring junior varsity athletics was one of Dr. Crew's first priorities when he became head of the city's schools last month. "As the new Chancellor," Dr. Crew said at a news conference yesterday, "I've  had probably no less than 50, 60 phone calls from people whose interest is in children, and who really see the viability of an athletic, competitive arena within which youngsters can experience success, learn discipline and attention to the detail that it takes to field and to be a participant in a group game."

Lehman High School in the Bronx, the principal, Robert Leder, said that his school began tryouts two weeks ago, relying on Dr. Crew's promise  to find financing. He said he hoped to have junior varsity basketball teams on the court by next week. "I'm as happy as a lark," Mr. Leder said. "I think it's a very, very important piece that was pulled out from under the kids." The principal at Prospect Heights High School in Brooklyn, Jerry Cioffi, also praised the announcement. "These are freshman and sophomore students -- the students who are most likely to drop out of school," Mr. Cioffi said. "I think the Chancellor made the right decision."

"I guarantee you that this is a high priority for us," Dr. Crew said. But he  added, "Long-term guarantees, whether it be for athletics or, for my purposes, art, music and so forth, would be premature." The Chancellor, members of the Board of Education and Representative Charles  B. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, who joined in the announcement, used the news  conference to exhort other companies to pledge money for the junior varsity program. "This could have a snowball effect," Carol A. Gresser, the school board president, said. "When people do contribute to collaborations and become our partners, more and more people want to do just that very same thing." Other contributing corporations include the Travelers Group Foundation, which gave $50,000 on behalf of Smith Barney, and the Wingate Foundation-PSAL, which pledged $25,000. Nike also gathered an additional $25,000 in individual contributions from the John McEnroe Foundation, the film maker Spike Lee and Derek Harper of the New York Knicks. Responding to concerns that students would, in essence, become billboards for Nike's products, Keith Peters, the company's director of public relations, offered assurances that students would not sport Nike's logo and that the program was not part of a marketing campaign.

He added that Nike had helped Chicago retain its school sports programs in 1992 with a one-time grant of $100,000.    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
