J. Upton’s power display overshadowed a tremendous pitching performance by his teammate James Shields. Upton hit three home runs, Shields threw a two-hitter and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Texas Rangers , 6-0, on Sunday. “You kind of dream about doing things like that, and they don’t happen very often,” Upton said. “And to do that against a Ranger ball club that pitches pretty well is a great feeling.” Upton hit solo homers in the first, fourth and sixth innings. He struck out in the second and received a standing ovation before hitting a broken-bat grounder to third in the eighth.

Tampa Bay took two of three in the weekend series against the Rangers, who lead the American League West. The first two games went to extra innings. The Rays trail the Yankees by two games. Shields (14-8) permitted just three base runners. Elvis Andrus reached on a first-inning error, Nelson Cruz had an infield single in the second and David Murphy singled in the eighth. “James Shields was on,” Texas Manager Ron Washington said. “He was really good. If you look at the game, you’ve got to give credit to James Shields. When a guy like that is pitching like that, it makes you look like you’re lethargic.” ROYALS 2, WHITE SOX 1 Mike Moustakas stroked a go-ahead single in the 10th inning to lift Kansas City at Chicago. The Royals plated both their runs with two outs in the 10th off Brett Myers (2-3). TWINS 8, INDIANS 7 Justin Morneau hit his second home run of the game in the bottom of the ninth inning to lift host Minnesota. With one out in the ninth, Morneau hit the first pitch from Indians reliever Vinnie Pestano (3-2) just inside the right-field foul pole for his 19th homer of the season. ATHLETICS 4, MARINERS 2 Jonny Gomes hit a three-run homer, Tommy Milone worked six strong innings and Oakland finished a three-game sweep at Seattle. The victory moved the A’s to three and a half games behind Texas in the A.L. West.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
