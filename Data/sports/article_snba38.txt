Youkilis’s two-out single against Jon Leicester (0-1) drove in Jason Varitek, breaking a 4-4 tie. Álex Cora, pinch-hitting for Dustin Pedroia, drove in two runs with a single in a three-run seventh as Boston took an 8-4 lead. Youkilis, 13 for his last 26, singled in another run as Boston scored five runs in the eighth. Julio Lugo had four of Boston’s 15 hits, including a run-scoring single in the eighth. A day after a 6-3 loss to the Orioles, Boston improved its record against Baltimore to 18-4 since the start of last season. They overcame a lackluster performance by Curt Schilling , who allowed four runs and nine hits in five and a third innings, his shortest outing since opening day. Javier López (1-0) relieved Schilling and allowed a tying groundout but retired all three batters he faced. Hideki Okajima pitched one and two-thirds scoreless innings and has not allowed a run in his past 16 appearances.

Detroit scored two runs in the first against Sidney Ponson (2-5), who missed the strike zone with seven of his first nine pitches and lasted only four innings. Justin Morneau, Minnesota’s first baseman, left the game in the eighth after a relay throw bounced on the  turf and broke his nose. Morneau, who won the league’s Most Valuable Player award last season, said that he expected to play today. BLUE JAYS 5, DEVIL RAYS 4 Vernon Wells scored the winning run from first base on Lyle Overbay’s two-out single in the seventh inning for host Toronto. With Wells running on a 3-2 pitch, Overbay lined a single into left-center against Brian Stokes (1-5). Playing the outfield for the first time this season, center fielder B. J. Upton made a weak throw to the cutoff man, Brendan Harris, whose relay to the plate was too late to catch Wells. Frank Thomas hit his 492nd career home run and Adam Lind homered for the Blue Jays. Tampa Bay lost its sixth in a row and is 6-13 on the road. WHITE SOX 5, ROYALS 4 Jermaine Dye’s run-scoring single won the game in the 10th for host Chicago.
