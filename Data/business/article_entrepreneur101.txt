That is the message that a leading donor delivered a few years ago in a letter to the Museum of Modern Art's board. The cost of the Modern's ambitious new home was rising into the stratosphere, and while many trustees had made multimillion-dollar contributions, a hard-core inner circle was doing a lot more. "These people were committing a much higher percentage of their net worths," the donor, who was part of that inner circle, recounted recently. The others, he argued, needed to follow suit. There are very few art museums where a trustee might feel guilty for giving only a few million dollars. But the Modern is hardly your average museum: when it reopens on Nov. 20 after a four-year renovation and expansion, it will have completed one of the most expensive projects ever undertaken by a cultural institution. The expanded building, a cool granite and glass fortress designed by the Japanese architect Yoshio Taniguchi, ultimately cost $858 million -- a sum that was raised largely during a period in which the city suffered a terrorist attack and an economic recession, while other big New York museums were laying people off and reducing hours.

It also has to do with the financial muscle of the museum's board, where a little gentle bullying has yielded seven- and eight-figure contributions. Above all, it has to do with the museum's determination not only to preside over the world's pre-eminent collection of 20th-century art, but to have the best building to display it in, to draw the biggest crowds and to keep growing -- in art holdings, square feet and financial assets -- well into the future.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Longtime museum directors express awe at the scope of the Modern's vision. "This is probably the biggest project of our lifetime," said David Ross, the president of the Artist Pension Trust and a former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, "and Glenn Lowry has pulled it off with aplomb." The museum is basking in its accomplishment, waging a big publicity drive to promote its glamorous new home. But on one subject, the Modern is mute: it refuses to discuss how it raised the money. Mr. Lowry declined to be interviewed for this article or to answer written questions about the expansion and its financing. A number of people close to the project, including about a dozen trustees, declined to be interviewed, did not return repeated calls or referred questions to the museum. "It is a longstanding museum policy never to talk about fund-raising," said a spokeswoman for the Modern, Ruth Kaplan. In a subsequent statement, the museum said it would not disclose the financing because it wanted to "honor the privacy of its supporters." Still, several trustees did speak about their experience, as did other people close to the museum; from their words and information in the public record, it is possible to piece together the story of the capital campaign and what it signals for the Modern's mission and identity. A picture emerges of the institution's evolution -- from a home for masterworks that was gleaming but cramped, and dependent on the particular vision of individual curators, into a well-oiled enterprise, organized around a single expansive vision and dependent on attention to revenue streams and bond ratings. The museum has acknowledged in a news release that more than $500 million - over two-thirds of the funds raised-- came directly from board pledges. Currently, the board includes 42 trustees and 15 life trustees. Even including the board's 14 "honorary" trustees, who do not have voting rights and do not play as direct a role in the museum, this amounts to an average individual contribution of more than $7 million. Earlier this year, Mr. Lowry told The New York Times that 50 trustees had each given $5 million or more. The museum also received $65 million from the city, the largest completed capital grant to a private institution in the city's history. (Unlike museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Modern does not ordinarily receive public financing.) In December 2001, with the help of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, the museum was able to float a $235 million bond for the expansion and a $24 million bond to finance previous debt; both offerings were tax-exempt. Underwritten by Goldman Sachs and issued by the Trust for Cultural Resources of the City of New York, the bond offerings essentially provided the museum with cash for construction while it awaited pledges and future gifts. They brought the museum's total debt to $398 million, which exceeded the museum's expendable assets at the time, $366 million. Even so, the bonds were given an A1 rating -- the fifth highest -- by Moody's Investor Service, the bond rating agency, on the strength of the museum's recent financial performance and its apparent ability to raise money. Approved just months after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the bond issue helped the Modern avoid the squeeze felt by other institutions. In 2002, the Guggenheim Museum canceled its own plans for a new $680 million building designed by Frank Gehry for the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and in 2003 the Brooklyn Museum of Art closed for two weeks to save money.

"It's a huge leap." THE project looked very different when it was first announced in the late 1990's. The economy was booming, and museums were thinking big. When Mr. Taniguchi's design was chosen in 1997, the target for the fund-raising campaign was $300 million to $400 million, several people close to the museum said. But when the Modern formally announced its capital campaign in 1998, the figure quickly rose to $650 million. Everything about the proposed building, from its huge glass curtain walls facing the garden to its slender, solid-steel mullions to the white oak flooring in some of the galleries, was expensive. Barbara Jakobson, a trustee and member of the museum's architect-selection committee, suggests that Mr. Taniguchi had sold the board on the costly design because it allowed the museum to increase greatly in size without seeming ponderous. She cited the architect's oft-quoted remark to Terence Riley, the Modern's chief curator of architecture and design: "He said, 'If you give me enough money, I'll design you a beautiful building. If you give me more, I'll make it disappear."' Thus, when construction began, the figure was suddenly $806 million, and ultimately, $858 million. "I think it shocked people how much it was going to be," said one person who took part in the discussions at the time and who, because of his relationship with the museum, asked not to be named. Another person who took part in the discussions said of the project, "It ran away with the budget." The cost of construction alone, $425 million, exceeded that of all but a few top museums. (By comparison, Mr. Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain cost $160 million.) The museum also spent close to $100 million on additional real estate in Midtown Manhattan and in Long Island City, where it established MoMA Queens, a temporary museum and long-term storage facility. More than $100 million went toward fund-raising costs, the temporary relocation and other expenses related to the expansion and capital campaign. In addition, tens of millions of dollars were needed for the endowment to cover the new operating costs -- which at $120 million a year are almost 50 percent higher than they had been in the old building. Virtually since his arrival as director in 1995, Mr. Lowry, who had previously guided the Art Gallery of Ontario through its own cash-strapped expansion, had been quietly preparing the Modern for the financial pressures of the construction. Traditionally the Modern had a hands-off management structure, with the top curators of each department given significant leeway in planning exhibitions and setting budgets, a practice which, several former staff members said, led to occasional deficits. Mr. Lowry established a new layer of management above the senior curators, appointing several deputy directors who answered directly to him and took over responsibilities, like the gallery design and budgeting of an exhibition, that were previously in the hands of curators. John Elderfield, for example, the museum's chief curator at large, was named deputy director of curatorial affairs. At the same time, Mr. Lowry introduced firm budgets for each department and reduced the number of expensive shows. "It's about running it as a business," said Lewis B. Cullman, a trustee involved with the capital campaign. It worked: in 1998, for example, the museum drew 1.6 million visitors and generated a net surplus without scheduling a single large-scale exhibition. In its analysis of the bond issue, Moody's wrote that "MoMA's financial management team has a demonstrated capability to achieve balanced current operations" and praised the museum for cutting back on big, financially unpredictable exhibitions.

It helped that the board is led by David Rockefeller Sr., its chairman emeritus, and Ronald S. Lauder, its chairman, who together bring enviable connections to the overlapping worlds of art, business and New York society. It also helped that the Modern's board had a reputation as one of the more elite clubs in the museum world and could expect more of its members. Current trustees include, among others, the real estate magnate Jerry I. Speyer, the software entrepreneur Peter Norton, the Hollywood executive Michael S. Ovitz, and the Greek shipping heir and socialite Philip S. Niarchos.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In previous decades, the Modern board has been a haven for wealthy connoisseurs of modern art; many of those, like Philip Johnson and, until her death in 2001, Elaine Dannheisser, were distinguished collectors in their own right. Several people close to the Modern describe the traditional dynamic of the board as based on "inherited understandings" of the museum's mission and on longtime close relationships with the curatorial staff. WHILE this continues to some extent, the financial pressures of the expansion have placed a powerful new emphasis on net worth. Longtime members of the board's inner circle, like Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Lauder and the president emeritus, Agnes Gund, helped to galvanize other trustees to make significant contributions to the project as it progressed -- both by example and by what one trustee called "peer pressure." Mr. Rockefeller and his wife, Peggy; Mr. Lauder and his wife, Jo Carole; and a vice chairman, Donald Marron, and his wife, Catie, made particularly large contributions, for which they received the right to have parts of the museum named after them. Mr. Cullman and his wife, Dorothy, have endowed a still-to-be completed education center, which will contain spaces named after the trustee Celeste Bartos and the broadcasting and candy industrialist John Edward Noble. But pledges were not enough. To maintain its bond rating, the museum had to ensure that the cash arrived in a timely way, not always an easy task. At a board meeting in June it emerged that the museum had a $20 million cash shortfall. Mr. Cullman offered $5 million if other members could assemble the remaining $15 million. Meanwhile, according to its annual financial statements, the museum was recruiting exceptionally wealthy patrons across the country. Since the capital campaign began, new additions to the board include, among others, Thomas H. Lee, a leveraged buyout specialist; Donald L. Bryant Jr., an insurance executive and winemaker; Gary Winnick, a former telecommunications executive; and Eli Broad, a Los Angeles developer. "They have more than a handful of billionaires, and that helps," Mr. Ross, , the former director of the Whitney and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, said. But they also now have more than a handful of people who may not know as much as previous members did about the museum and its vanguard role in the history of modern art. And speaking on the condition of anonymity, some observers close to the museum expressed concern that the selection of some new members seems to have had as much to do with business as with modern art. Mr. Winnick, then a recently minted billionaire, was introduced to Mr. Rockefeller in 2000 by a private banking executive at Chase, where Mr. Rockefeller was a former chairman. At the time, Chase was actively pursuing contracts with Mr. Winnick's company, Global Crossing. (The company later filed for bankruptcy, though Mr. Winnick's personal fortune survived largely intact.) Mr. Winnick pledged $5 million when he joined the board in 2000. Mr. Broad, who was elected to the board during the past year, said he was one of the group who had given "$5 million or more" to the museum. "I was not asked to contribute when I became a trustee," he said. "On our own volition, my wife and I decided to give to the campaign."   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Board members and their business connections have also served the project in other ways. In 1996, Mr. Speyer, a longtime trustee and a vice chairman, used his stature in the real estate industry as well as his negotiating skills to help the museum acquire the adjacent Dorset Hotel and two other neighboring properties. The museum paid only $50 million, although the sellers had originally asked for a much higher figure. (Daniel Neidich, a real estate investment banker for Goldman Sachs, who assisted Mr. Speyer with the purchase, has also since joined the Modern's board.) Robert B. Menschel, the current president of the Modern board, is a senior director of Goldman Sachs. The business community remains, for the moment, confident in the enlarged museum's finances. Fund-raising for the endowment has represented only a small part of the capital campaign, accounting for $70 million of the $717 million raised to date. But the museum's operations have broken even each of the past 10 years, including during the expansion, and the Modern has improved its assets-to-debt ratio slightly since the 2001 bond issue. Successful future budgeting will partly depend on the museum's ability to generate higher ticket revenue. The museum has projected that it will be able to attract as many as 2.5 million visitors a year, an increase of about one million over previous attendance, even though it has raised its ticket price to $20. The museum has also recently acquired two more properties on the site to give it extra room to grow. "The outlook is stable," Naomi Richman, a Moody's analyst who rated the 2001 bond issue, said recently. Ms. Richman said that the bond rating would stay at A1 and was not likely to be raised in the next few months. In 2001, Moody's had indicated that the rating might improve once the museum completed the project. Several people who have long been involved with the museum worry about its new financial orientation. They suggest that the museum's curators may be losing ground to upper-level administrators. "This is now an administered museum run by a director who is essentially all-powerful, working for a board that is used to corporations that are run in somewhat the same way," said one former high-ranking staff member who worked under Mr. Lowry and his predecessor, Richard Oldenburg. Board members point out that Mr. Lowry has included senior curators in the planning and execution of the project. "He let the curators speak their thoughts," Ms. Jakobson said. "This required making a lot of choices, and I know the senior staff were brought in." But Laurent Lapierre, a professor of arts management at the Canadian business school HEC Montreal, who recently completed a case study on the Modern that was published in the International Journal of Arts Management, said that while Mr. Lowry makes decisions in consultation his staff members, he does not work by consensus. "He is running the show, and he is confident in his decisions," Mr. Lapierre said. The museum's tax filings from the past few years suggest a shift among the highest paid employees from curatorial staff to management. From 1998 to 2001, for example, only one curator, Mr. Elderfield, was among the five employees with the highest compensation, and in 2002, the most recent year for which records were available, there were none. During the same period, Mr. Lowry's compensation has more than doubled, to $619,663; and that of James Gara, the museum's chief operating officer, has risen by 50 percent, to $300,000. Mr. Ross said that it was natural for an institution to change its identity somewhat after such a large expansion. "The question is whether the economics of managing a facility of this scale will make it more risk-averse," he said. One concern, for example, is whether the pressure to keep visitor numbers high will discourage the museum from pursuing critically important exhibitions that do not have a demonstrable popular appeal.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Still, Robert Storr, a professor at the Institute of Fine Art at New York University and a former curator of painting and sculpture at the Modern, suggested that the museum's staff would be more critical than the Modern's size in determining whether the museum moved in a safer, more conservative direction. "It's not an inevitable consequence of bigness -- it's a question of will," he said. "It's not institutions that run people, but people who run institutions, and their priorities." Of course, the real test will be in the art that goes into the building -- now and in the future. The museum insists that a provocative new display of the permanent collection, and expansive new spaces for contemporary art, will help the institution keep its edge. The Modern's exceptional financial resources may help in this regard: this year several trustees endowed a $1 million fund to purchase artwork created in the last five years. Whatever the result, in rebuilding itself the Modern has indisputably done a lot more than change its clothes. It has become a vastly bigger institution, with all the decorum and responsibilities that come with that status. "It's going to be the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art," Mr. Ross said.
