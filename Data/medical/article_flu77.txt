But last week, more than grim-faced farmers attended the association meeting, called to discuss what for the $111 million state poultry industry is its gravest threat today, a virus that is working its way through flocks along the East Coast. Avian influenza, as the virus is known, struck two years ago in Pennsylvania, and more than 17 million birds were dead before it had run its course, costing farmers there $51 million in lost revenues and clean-up costs. This time, however, the epidemic is striking closer to home. It has been confirmed in flocks on Long Island and in Massachusetts, and although it has not struck any of this state's 221 commercial poultry operations, birds carrying the disease have been found at two Bridgeport packing plants.

State agriculture officials, meanwhile, have issued a surveillance program in an effort to trace any contacts between infected flocks and farms here. ''Any particular place might have seven or eight contacts in a single day,'' including grain trucks, egg trucks, salesmen, delivery people, and other poultrymen, who might have been at other farms earlier, said Dr. Louis van der Heide, a poultry expert with the University of Connecticut Cooperative Extension Service. ''We have no proof, as of today, that any farm in Connecticut has been infected,'' Dr. van der Heide said on Tuesday. ''But the investigaton is continuing.'' Though the disease had not been confirmed in Connecticut flocks in the last two weeks, 13 state farms have come under ''intense surveillance,'' because of suspected contacts with infected flocks, said Agriculture Commissioner Kenneth B. Andersen. ''We're living with our fingers crossed,'' Mr. Andersen said. Mr. Andersen said his inspectors stopped at least four poultry transport trucks from coming into the state, and turned them back because they did not meet local cleanliness standards. Also, he said, he is seeking authority to put his inspectors in state police vehicles to conduct spot checks of chicken truckers, and Governor O'Neill has asked President Reagan to guarantee aid for Connecticut farmers if the disease strikes here.

''I'd rather test more flocks than I have to, send out more people than I have to, than to miss one case of avian influenza.'' Avian influenza was originally a mild virus infecting chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese. But in November of 1983, research has shown, it mutated into a form that kills as much as 10 percent a day of infected flocks.

In the first outbreak, only farms in Pennsylvania and neighboring states were affected, and by the summer of 1984 it appeared to have been eradicated. Last month, however, it came back. This time, the disease has appeared in flocks in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. About 300,000 birds have been destroyed so far. Acting on information that infected birds from New York were being brought into this state, Mr. Andersen quarantined three Bridgeport packing plants and found contaminated birds at two of the plants. So far, Mr. Andersen said, his department has confirmed contact between those two plants and 13 state farms, and he has asked those farms to go under voluntary quarantine. Mr. Andersen said he was encouraged that initial tests of the flocks showed no infection, but he said the tests were continuing. ''Everybody is nervous,'' said Sam Impoco, who put his flock of 30,000 birds in Brooklyn and Willington under a voluntary quarantine at Mr. Andersen's request. The quarantine was lifted when the tests were negative.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''I never knew the Federal Government had so many poeple on the payroll,'' he said. ''All of sudden I'm seeing agents and doctors and inspectors.'' Though his birds have been certified clean, Mr. Gilman continues to stop every delivery truck coming onto his property, spraying trucks and drivers with Environ-D, a disinfectant known to kill the virus. ''The virus is very easy to kill,'' Mr. Gilman said. ''You can do it with a strong soap. Lysol will do it. But once it's in the birds, there's nothing you can do.'' Mr. Gilman said he would continue the spraying routine even this summer, despite the fact that research indicates the virus dies in warm weather. ''So it costs me $1,500 or $1,600 a month,'' Mr. Gilman said. ''That's nothing compared to what we could lose. We're not going to stop spraying.''
