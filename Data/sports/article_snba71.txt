But after a hazing ritual left the 19-year-old pledge too drunk to breathe, a nurse who had helped save his life broke hospital rules and called his mother. Four days later, a Georgia Supreme Court ruling opened the university's secret student court to public scrutiny. And within weeks, what would have been a closed-door disciplinary hearing about the near-fatal incident was thrown into the public spotlight. The case remains a rare window on a secret within a secret: the protected place that fraternities occupy at the heart of a campus justice system that operates at most of the nation's 3,600 colleges and universities. Behind those closed doors, thousands of criminal offenses virtually disappear each academic year. At the student court hearing in Georgia, it emerged that Mr. Higdon, a tall,  thin young man, had been made to drink a fifth of Heaven's Hill whisky in 45 minutes. An off-duty security guard intervened to get the sophomore to the hospital before he could die of alcohol poisoning, and doctors had to put him on a respirator to resuscitate him. So no one else would know, a fraternity brother put the hospital charges on his personal credit card, expecting to be discreetly reimbursed by Sigma Phi Epsilon.

Sigma Phi Epsilon had been on some form of probation or social suspension at the University of Georgia for six of the previous seven years. Its violations had been handled through the campus justice system and its history of hazing -- which is illegal in Georgia and 36 other states -- had never been mentioned in the glossy brochures the university sent incoming freshmen to promote fraternity membership.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       To be sure, fraternities are not the only groups with special status in the closed world of campus justice that emerges from an examination of confidential  case files, police records, civil litigation and more than 200 interviews at colleges around the country. But the treatment of fraternities most clearly reveals the fault lines of a system where panels of students, teachers and administrators judge serious offenses without public accountability. With 400,000 members at 800 campuses nationwide -- more than double the number at the low point in 1971 -- fraternities now spend a third of their budgets, or some $30 million a year, to pay liability costs, national fraternity executives say. The vast majority of claims are settled out of court and never become public, and there is no record of the number paid each year. But an insurance analysis of more than 900 claims against fraternities in a six-year period reveals that one out of four resulted from a death, paralysis or other serious injury. That analysis, produced by Harris & Harris of Kentucky Inc., an insurance brokerage, as a tool to teach fraternities risk management, found that alcohol had been an important factor in more than 80 percent of most types of claims, including claims for sexual assaults, fights and falls from the roofs of fraternity houses. Research by Harvard and Columbia Universities shows that 95 percent of all violent crime on campuses around the country are alcohol-related, and it documents the destructive secondhand effects of alcohol abuse on other students, especially at colleges with a high prevalence of binge drinking. Studies also confirm what many college administrators know: fraternity members are the students most likely to engage in binge drinking. Yet many of the same institutions now waging educational campaigns against alcohol abuse and student violence continue to handle fraternity crimes with all the leniency and discretion a closed-door system of justice can afford. Where fraternities are strong, they are often disciplined in courts of their  own or in student-organization courts, responsible to the same university administrators who promote Greek life. Fraternity codes of silence, demands for  group loyalty and opportunities for group retaliation often frustrate investigators and intimidate witnesses, critics say. And when student courts do  mete out significant penalties, a fraternity appeal to the administration -- bolstered by fraternity alumni -- often results in the sanction being reduced or overturned. "They'd be crazy not to appeal," said Claudia Schamp, who directs the Office  of Greek Life at the University of Georgia. "We run around here like Rambo trying to figure out the facts -- you almost become like a pseudo-police officer and lawyer to get at the truth -- and then we get the rug pulled out from underneath us. It's very, very frustrating."   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   All elements of a campus justice system, including the campus police, ultimately answer to top college administrators. Seventy percent of campus police departments have full arrest power, giving them great discretion to send  cases straight to district attorneys or to keep them in-house for proceedings that range from elaborate trials before student justices to mediation by a single administrator. Most offenses handled by such systems involve infractions like drinking by underage students. But increasingly at colleges across the country, administrators say, they make use of student conduct codes to judge student crimes as serious as assault and arson. William R. Bracewell, who presides over one of the most elaborate student judiciaries in the country as director of judicial programs here at the University of Georgia, denies that fraternities are favored. In fact, he said, fraternities on campus "perceive us as very anti-Greek." But he proudly proclaims his own fraternity ties, acquired as a late initiate because he could  not afford to join when he was a student. He said he had served on his fraternity's national board and in the national conference that represents 62 American fraternities with 5,500 college chapters. Like other supporters of fraternities, Mr. Bracewell said the problems of a few were too often used to discredit a system that offers lifelong friendships and personal growth to the vast majority of its members. Mr. Bracewell makes no secret of his loathing for the Georgia Supreme Court decision in The Red and Black v. Board of Regents, which opened the door to the  coverage of student court hearings here -- in theory. In practice, complains the newspaper publisher, Harry Montevideo, the university has done everything to frustrate coverage, from scheduling fraternity cases late at night to charging up to $50 a case in copying fees. "I am an educator," Mr. Bracewell declared, looking very much at home on a campus where the Corinthian columns are three stories high and incoming male freshmen are asked their grandfather's fraternity. "I am not part of the criminal justice system. I am not a prosecutor. I've been pushed into a role that I am most uncomfortable with." On Fraternity Row Patterns of Crime Called 'Frightening' The center of gravity of fraternity life at the University of Georgia is a few blocks off campus on South Milledge Avenue, where antebellum-style homes sport Greek letters above white-columned verandas. The campus police have no jurisdiction here, and the local police tread gently. In the last academic year, when two unrelated rapes were reported at one fraternity on this tree-shaded street, the Athens-Clarke County police refused for weeks to reveal the name of the fraternity, Beta Theta Pi. No charges were ever filed. The university's official crime statistics brochure, "Safe & Secure," lists no rapes in 1994. But just down the avenue in a plain brick office building, the nonprofit advocacy organization Safe Campuses Now has a different set of numbers. In an unpublished survey of 918 sorority women and 240 fraternity men conducted at their houses one night this year, 79 of the women, or 8.6 percent,  said they had been the victims of acquaintance or date rapes, and 5 percent of the men -- 12 of them -- said that they had committed such rapes.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The survey, conducted by Michael Parker, a graduate student in psychology, showed even higher percentages when the question was more oblique: nearly 11 percent of the men, who were surveyed anonymously, agreed with the statement "I  have continued sexual activity even after my partner said no," and 18.8 percent  said they had engaged in sex with someone they felt was reluctant. "It's scary how many sexual-assault cases come from fraternity parties that people will never know about," said Ruth Anne Smrekar, who served simultaneously as an advocate in the student judiciary and as a counselor at the local rape crisis center, where she saw many student victims. "It's frightening, and you can't say anything. You know certain ones are bad, and you can't go to the sorority and say, 'You really shouldn't have socials with them.' " For nine fraternities on South Milledge alone, police computer records show 43 incident reports between October 1994 and the end of 1995, including reports  of a rape, a battery and five burglaries. None was counted in the official university crime statistics, published to comply with the 1990 Federal Right to  Know and Campus Security Act. The law requires colleges to report crimes that occur at recognized student organizations off campus as well as on campus, but that provision is widely ignored. And off-campus fraternities exist in the middle of the blind spot. The Response Colleges Buffeted By Many Pressures Fraternities are a conundrum of university life, explained E. T. Joe Buchanan, a veteran dean and a lawyer, who recently told a plenary session of the 1,000-member Association for Student Judicial Affairs that the secret to long service in a large public land-grant institution was "never messing with athletics or fraternities."

Alumni who belonged to fraternities or sororities are up to three times as likely to donate to their colleges, a University of Indiana study found. In an era of uncertain job prospects for college graduates, fraternities  seem to offer added value: useful connections in the real world, more attractive or affordable housing than in the dormitories and the aura of fun demanded of colleges that promote themselves like cruise lines. But social intolerance is increasing for what Mr. Buchanan, a past national board member of Lambda Chi, described in an interview as "the big three" -- hazing, alcohol abuse and sexual assault -- and bad publicity and legal liability are making colleges skittish about the trade-offs. Some institutions,  like the University of Maryland, have responded to fraternity scandals with ambitious programs to set and enforce standards. Others, like the University of Virginia and the University of Colorado at Boulder, have chosen an arm's length relationship, leaving the fraternity problem to local prosecutors. Technically, that does not protect fraternities, said Mr. Buchanan, now the dean of Tidewater Community College in Virginia Beach and a past president of the American College Personnel Association. "But as a practical matter," Mr. Buchanan said, "whoever is the prosecutor in that county probably graduated from that institution, and probably was on the student judiciary and a member of one of the three or four most prestigious fraternities on the campus. And he can say, 'We have serious crime in this county -- why should we prosecute students?' " Both institutional approaches often lead to campus lessons in cynicism. At Miami University of Ohio, for example, when a scandal related to hazing and alcohol rocked the Sigma Chi fraternity two years ago, students saw the fraternity's three-year disciplinary suspension abruptly reduced -- without any  formal appeal proceedings -- to the equivalent of two semesters.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   "It's all about alumni status and their ability to mobilize funds," said Emily Hebert, now an editor at The Miami Student newspaper, who was a freshman at the time. "For two days, there was an influx of Mercedes-Benzes, lawyers and  doctors with Sigma Chi bumper stickers on their cars." While students were kept in ignorance of the details of the case, the accounts that circulated served as a powerful deterrent against future whistle-blowing. "One of the pledges turned them in, so they beat him up, hosed  him down and made him eat hallucinogenic mushrooms," said Michael Sommers, who sits on the student court of appeals and also writes for the student newspaper.  "He left the campus and it was never made public." Brian Breittholz, the head of the Office of Greek Life at Miami University of Ohio, was dismissive of such stories but will still provide no specifics. He did say, "The rumor that there were the big Mercedeses and payoffs, that did not happen." The fraternity's national board "cleaned house" at the local chapter, he said, expelling most members from the fraternity and choosing about 10 to rebuild it. Criminal prosecution was considered, he added, but in Ohio, where hazing is a fourth-degree misdemeanor, "the support you're going to find from the local law  enforcement is pretty minimal." In an interview, John Holcomb, the longtime local prosecutor, was quick to acknowledge his own fraternity ties with the cry, "I'm an A.T.O., the great big hairy-chested men." At the University of Colorado at Boulder, where the student activities center is named for the Coors Brewing Company, administrators maintain that they have no control over off-campus Greek organizations even though they provide them with a campus center and a staff of adviser-advocates. An 18-year-old pledge once stumbled out of the off-campus Delta Tau Delta fraternity into the arms of an administrator from the University of Colorado police department, located next door. While fraternity members shouted from the  front porch not to say anything, the pledge passed out and had to be rushed to the hospital with alcohol poisoning. He had been forced to drink shots of vodka  every time he made a mistake in a game of fraternity trivia. The campus police declined to bring charges. In 1994, it was a 19-year-old Pi Kappa Alpha pledge who had to go to the hospital when the University of Colorado police found him vomiting and barely conscious in a dormitory room after a "Big Brother Week" ritual. In the same semester, an 18-year-old freshman, Amanda MacDonald, died after a drunken fraternity man lost control of a car on which she and others were "roof surfing" after a fraternity drinking party. Tighter drinking policies were announced. But the following fall, an intoxicated 19-year-old woman at a Delta Sigma Chi party was physically forced into a bedroom and raped repeatedly by a fraternity  member and his guest.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   "We'd see that every year," Mary Keenan, an assistant prosecutor with the Boulder County District Attorney's Office, said of gang rapes at the fraternities' fall drinking parties. "One girl becomes so intoxicated she's not  ambulatory. They put her in a room, turn out the lights, and she's being raped in the dark and she has no idea who's doing it. "Oh, and the brotherhood is amazing," she added. "I tried to interview witnesses in connection with this case, guys who had seen the victim curled up in a ball, crying in the hall. It was like this code of secrecy. Their allegiance to their fraternity was much stronger than their allegiance to the truth." What made the case unusual were the guilty pleas Ms. Keenan got. One man, Justin Lips, was sentenced to five years in prison last year, while the other, Daniel Clark, got 90 days in the Boulder County jail and a three-year deferred prison sentence. The case helped prompt a campaign by the police and the Boulder community called "Enough Is Enough," which made fraternities a target last year  in a crackdown on drinking by underage students. Some 2,500 summonses were issued in the police raids, leading to some $21,000 in fines per fraternity party. The fraternities formally capitulated after three months, declaring that  alcohol would no longer be served at any fraternity house. For the first time in memory, Ms. Keenan said, no fraternity party rapes were reported last fall. The measures taken by the Boulder police included warning the parents of incoming freshmen as well as insurance carriers about the fraternities in violation of alcohol laws, which highlights what is not being done elsewhere by  campus police and college judicial programs. A Spotlight Student Records At Heart of Struggle In John Higdon's case at the University of Georgia, the student organizations court found Sigma Phi Epsilon guilty on six counts of hazing, alcohol misuse and disorderly conduct and sentenced the fraternity to five years' full suspension. The fraternity, shocked at being disbanded, fully expected Charles B. Knapp,  the university president, to reduce the sanction on appeal, as he had done in many other cases. But this time, he let the punishment stand. In Red and Black v. Board of Regents, the Georgia Supreme Court wrote: "We are mindful that openness in sensitive proceedings is sometimes unpleasant, difficult and occasionally harmful. Nevertheless, the policy of this state is that the public's business must be open, not only to protect against potential abuse but also to maintain the public's confidence in its officials." The ruling declared that nonacademic disciplinary records were not educational in the meaning of the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act. But last year, after intense lobbying by college officials around the country, the Department of Education came down on the other side: disciplinary records are educational, the department ruled, unless Congress says otherwise. There has been neither a criminal prosecution nor a civil suit in Mr. Higdon's case. As is typical in hazing cases, he blamed himself at first and still hoped to join the fraternity. He asked for his mother's silence. Now they  both believe that the public attention made the sanction stick.

"I explained to John that I did not want that to ever happen to another mother's or father's child."  Continue reading the main story        Weâre interested in your feedback on this page.
