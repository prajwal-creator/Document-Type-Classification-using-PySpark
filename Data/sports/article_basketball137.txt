On weekend nights, when the atmosphere is more nightclub than clubhouse, a dress code forbids sneakers and baseball caps. Tommy Rebello, the manager, described the look as “urban chic.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       PLAYLIST During basketball games, a D.J. pipes in crossover hits from Kanye West, Will Smith and Rihanna during commercials. Later, expect popular (if not populist) hip-hop and R&B. DRINKS The cocktail list emphasizes sugary concoctions with names fit for romantic comedies starring Vivica A. Fox.
