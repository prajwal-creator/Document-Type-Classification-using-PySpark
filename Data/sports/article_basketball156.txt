That, and an excellent uneven bars routine, added up to a gold medal for Caquatto in the all-around competition at the Pan American Games on Wednesday. “The beam routine went pretty smoothly for me,” said Caquatto, 17, who became the seventh straight American to win the event at the Pan Am Games. “I just had one major wobble.” Caquatto, from Naperville, Ill., scored 14.725 points on the uneven bars, the only competitor to break 14. That put her in the lead heading into her final event, the balance beam. Despite the miscue during that routine, she stuck her dismount and held on to first place.

The Olympic gold medalist Shannon Miller won the title in 1995, as did her fellow world champions Chellsie Memmel (2003) and Shawn Johnson (2007). Caquatto also helped the United States win the team gold. HAMMER RECORD FALLS Kibwe Johnson won the first gold for the United States in track and field at this year’s Games, tossing the hammer 261 feet 3 inches for a Pan Am Games record. The previous record of 261-2 ¼ was set by another American, Lance Deal, in Winnipeg in 1999.  Photo        Bridgette Caquatto became the seventh American in a row to win the Pan Am all-around.

When I realized that I was throwing pretty hard, I knew I had a chance.” U.S. BASKETBALL SURVIVES The United States held on to defeat the Dominican Republic, 77-76, in men’s basketball in the opening Group B match for both teams. The Americans led, 77-74, before the Dominicans cut the lead to a point on a basket by Manuel Guzman with 4.6 seconds to go. They could have tied the score by sinking a free throw on a 3-point play, but Guzman missed.

They tried to force the ball inside, but the shot was blocked at the buzzer. “It was a close one,” said Lance Thomas, who had 15 points and 16 rebounds for the United States. “In the second half we had to fight because we gave up an 8-point lead and knew we had to pressure the ball and make big plays.” The Canadian team added to the country’s run of success at the Games, rallying to beat Argentina, 83-79, in overtime.

Canada has never won a medal in men’s basketball at the Pan American Games. Canada came back to beat the United States and claim gold in baseball on Tuesday, the men’s volleyball team beat the Americans in a five-set marathon group match and the women’s soccer team reached the final by defeating Colombia, 2-1. CANADA WINS CANOE RACE The first medal Wednesday went to the Canadian team when it won the women’s K4 500-meter race in canoeing. ... Argentina claimed the first gold in Basque pelota when Facundo Andreasen and Sergio Villegas won the men’s rubber paleta event.
