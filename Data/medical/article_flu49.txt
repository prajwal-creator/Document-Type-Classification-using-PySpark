By Caroline Moorehead. Illustrated. 373 pp. Boston: David R. Godine. $35. A TRULY international existence offers rich, terrifying possibilities. It mitigates xenophobia, invites diverse experience and induces an inevitable lack of ease. Caroline Moorehead's fascinating biography of Iris Origo charts such a glamorous, loaded, unsettled life. An Anglo-American heiress who lived in Italy, married an Italian, had English lovers and wrote eloquently about subjects ranging from Byron's daughter to everyday events in the Italian countryside under Mussolini's Fascism, Origo was a true cosmopolite of vast energy and stunning intelligence. Moorehead, whose previous books include a biography of Bertrand Russell and a history of the Red Cross, describes the colorful childhood of the rich little girl who became the Marchesa of Val d'Orcia and gives detailed information on her writing and her complex private life. She also reveals Origo's splendid and anonymous philanthropy; Origo was the rare person of privilege who used her position for the real betterment of the world. In 1909, when the father of the 7-year-old Iris Cutting was on his deathbed, he wrote his wife, ''All this national feeling makes people so unhappy.'' About their only child, he instructed: ''Bring her up somewhere where she does not belong, then she can't have it. . . . She should really be cosmopolitan, from deep down. . . . When she grows up she really will be free to love or marry anyone she likes, of any country, without it being difficult.'' His daughter would, indeed, transcend boundaries. Iris Margaret Cutting -- the ''Margaret'' appeared after relatives insisted that ''Iris Cutting'' was ''too botanical'' -- was raised in Fiesole, overlooking Florence, in a villa that had been built for Cosimo de' Medici. Vasari called it ''a magnificent palace,'' and Lorenzo the Magnificent discussed poetry there. The clothing worn centuries later by Iris and Sybil, her widowed mother, embodied the airy elegance of Iris's childhood. As a little girl, she wore ''long white muslin dresses and floppy muslin hats'' while picking wild strawberries in the Apennines; Sybil was typically clad in ''scarlet silk cloaks, heavy pleated silk Fortuny gowns, gossamer chiffon dresses and cashmere shawls.'' Bernard Berenson had the villa next door and distinguished visitors streamed into the sumptuous villa (Moorehead provides a fine account of the deeply established English community in Florence). But Iris suffered a lot. The hypochondriac Sybil was often bed-ridden, yet managed to remarry twice, making Iris feel like a complete outsider. Iris was one of those women who flourished in maturity after agonizing in adolescence; as a debutante, she felt as awkward among Italian nobility as with her wealthy relatives back in the United States. Her existence, Origo herself noted, alternated ''between caviar and bread and milk'' -- contrasts Iris chose later in life.

With cool objectivity, she outlines the rise of Fascism in Italy and provides thumbnail sketches of various people, among them Mussolini. We learn that when Iris met Antonio Origo -- the illegitimate son of a marchese who was both a cavalry officer and artist, and of the Russian wife of an Italian duke, with whom she had two sons -- and Antonio subsequently proposed marriage, Iris's mother so disapproved of this man (who was 10 years Iris's elder, Roman Catholic and too handsome) that she persuaded the couple not to communicate for six months to test their devotion. The day the time period lapsed, Origo repeated his proposal, and the match was permitted, although Sybil never emerged from her bed to attend the large and festive wedding.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The couple opted for hard work and rugged country life. They acquired La Foce, a rural estate Iris called ''a lunar landscape, pale and inhuman.'' Iris and Antonio learned to reap by hand, plow with oxen, build dikes and make roads. They worked longer days than the 25 families they employed. At the age of 22, Iris initially had a hard time -- she broke the syringe the first time she tried to give an injection to an elderly woman suffering from asthma -- but she soon started a school for the 50 or so children on the estate, taught these members of illiterate families to read and provided for every aspect of their well-being. It was a lovely, unusual existence. Back at the villa in Fiesole, Iris nursed her newborn son while listening to the fountains outside, and Antonio read to her from D'Annunzio. When she came down with flu in Davos, the doctor had her sleep late, ice skate for an hour, linger on the hotel balcony and play solitaire. At La Foce, Iris commandeered the planting and irrigating of those arid grounds to create a splendid landscape, devoting herself to gardening because she liked ''its continuity, and its cruelty, and its hopefulness.'' And during World War II the Origos were among the few aristocrats who helped everyone escaping Fascism, Moorehead writes, whether they were ''prisoners, partisans or deserters.'' Quietly, sometimes secretly (and certainly without a tax deduction) Iris paid for the higher education of needy children, covered mortgage payments, provided funds for medical care, financed training programs and gave moral support. What is startling is that Antonio wore black shirts in support of Fascism, and Iris called Mussolini ''a very great man.'' But then, as Moorehead sagely explains, praise was also accorded Mussolini by, among others, Winston Churchill, Neville Chamberlain and Otto Kahn.

She discovered a cache of love letters between Byron and the Countess Teresa Guiccioli and wrote ''The Last Attachment,'' a colorful book about their relationship. After gaining access to an obscure archive of medieval documents, she wrote ''The Merchant of Prato,'' about everyday 14th-century life. Moorehead provides copious and interesting details on the publishing, editing and reviewing of these and Origo's other books. But unfortunately she fails to bring them to life, either through good excerpts or trenchant commentary. The same dryness applies to Moorehead's depiction of people and workmanlike detailing of love affairs. The facts are interesting, but the reader cannot adequately feel or see the charm of the characters. Yet the text is salvaged by judicious quotations. Consider Antonio after he has taken off from the villa to avoid the exiled Queen of Greece when she came to tea: ''They are unbearable, these unemployed queens.'' And there is Kenneth Clark hearing Berenson declare, on the day Hitler came to power, ''This will turn into something that will make Mussolini look like a fairy tale.'' In her afterword, Moorehead recalls the one occasion when she met Iris Origo, in 1980, eight years before her subject's death. Having gone to La Foce to write a profile for The Times of London, she found the Marchese ''elegant and beautifully dressed, her features more delicate now in old age. Because slightly ill at ease, she was also rather formidable.'' The description is surely accurate, but lacks the dash or sharpness of Origo's own writing. For that we must turn to R. W. B. Lewis's 1975 biography of Edith Wharton. Wharton was a friend of Origo's father. In three brief paragraphs, we thrill to the flare of Iris Origo as we never do in Moorehead's 373 pages. Lewis describes Origo as a woman ''with a deep quiet intelligence and a love both of literature and of the men and women who made it,'' and as someone who wrote ''with delicate acuteness.'' He demonstrates that superb concurrence of traits by quoting Origo on Edith Wharton's visit to the Cutting family estate on Long Island. ''I caught a glimpse of the other Edith, elegant, formidable, as hard and dry as porcelain. Then, as she looked down on her old friends, the face softened, even the erectness of her spine relaxed a little. She was no longer the trim, hard European hostess, but a nice old American lady. Edith had come home.'' In that stunning account, we encounter Iris Origo as a sublime wordsmith and an astute and passionate observer of human behavior. We also see the clarity with which Origo recognized contrasting cultures vying for supremacy over Edith Wharton's life as they did over her own. Caroline Moorehead supplies, diligently, the details of the life of this enchanting person. With Iris Origo's verve and insight and humor also evident, we glimpse a spectacular human being.
