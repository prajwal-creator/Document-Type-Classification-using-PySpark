To the Editor: The tendency to assign blame when mistakes occur is inimical to an environment in which we hope learning and improvement will take place. But there is some need to hold people accountable for egregious errors. Where’s the balance? Here’s an example. Several years ago a patient woke up from orthopedic surgery at my former hospital and asked her surgeon, “Why is the bandage on my left ankle instead of my right ankle?” It was at that moment that her doctor realized he had operated on the wrong leg. He immediately reported the error to the proper people in the hospital. A thorough apology was also offered to the patient. We realized that there were systemic problems in our preoperative procedures that went beyond this case. Our clinical leaders spent several weeks strengthening our care delivery system to minimize the chance of a similar error in the future. Upon hearing of this case, one of our trustees asked me what I, as chief executive of the hospital, intended to do to punish the doctor. I replied: “Nothing. He already feels terrible about this mistake. Further punishment does not act as a deterrent in these kind of inadvertent errors.” A senior physician added that if we want to establish an environment that promotes disclosure of errors and near misses, the fastest way to drive reporting underground is to punish someone who has made a mistake.

But in my field, we would certainly punish anyone who violated rules or procedures in this manner, even if by accident.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       His field? Investment banking. I laughed, thinking of how rarely people in that field seem to get punished when they break the rules. People in the medical field are well intentioned and feel great distress when they harm patients. Let’s reserve punishment for clear cases of negligence. Other errors should be used to reinforce a learning environment in which we are hard on the problems rather than hard on the people. PAUL LEVY Newton, Mass., Oct. 14, 2013 The writer is the former chief executive of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the author of “Goal Play! Leadership Lessons From the Soccer Field.”  Readers React The adage about learning from one’s mistakes rings especially true where patients’ lives are at stake. Rates of medical error are staggering. Approximately 225,000 deaths per year (some estimates are much higher) are caused directly by medical “care” itself, such as unnecessary surgery and medication errors. This makes medical errors the third leading cause of death in the United States, after heart disease and cancer. Nonetheless, it is hardly surprising that doctors fail to come clean given our society’s climate of malpractice. The fear of litigation, more so than the fear of reprimand, stops action to prevent future errors and also damages the doctor-patient relationship. Poor communication often prompts patients to files lawsuits in the first place. “I’m sorry” laws, which hold expressions of apology, fault or sympathy to be inadmissible as evidence of an admission of liability, are an important step in the right direction toward achieving the balance for which Mr. Levy calls. Such laws, which have already been adopted in 36 states, encourage transparency between physicians and patients and pave the way for better care over all. KATRINA HUI Hamilton, Ontario, Oct. 17, 2013 The writer, who has a master’s degree in bioethics, is a medical student.

He asks that well-intentioned doctors not be “punished” and suggests that “a thorough apology” offered to the patient is enough. But medical negligence is almost always committed by the well intentioned. With rare exceptions, it is “punished” through the insurance and civil justice systems, by an award of damages to the victim. Mr. Levy speaks of a surgeon who operated on the wrong leg of a patient and pleads for understanding of the doctors who may be sued or disciplined for similar acts. Where is his concern for the patient who suffered an unnecessary operation, with its attendant pain, anxiety and discomfort — and who must undergo a second operation to do what should have been done the first time? Shouldn’t a negligent physician be liable for the patient’s avoidable harm and suffering? RICHARD B. JACOBSON Madison, Wis., Oct. 16, 2013 The writer is a lawyer who has represented victims of malpractice.  The senior physician’s remark that doctors should not be punished for mistakes because it will drive reporting underground, and Mr. Levy’s apparent support of his words, are outrageous. As described, operating on the wrong ankle was a clear case of negligence and malpractice. I hope the patient sued. CARL N. STEEG New York, Oct. 16, 2013 The writer is a pediatric cardiologist.  I was fortunate to attend a conference on patient safety for which Mr. Levy was a faculty leader. I agree that we need to change the culture regarding the disclosure of medical errors. We cannot learn from what we do not know, and what we do not know can seriously harm our patients. One strategy that has been implemented at my home institution is the celebration of “good catches.” Every Monday, all hospital employees receive an e-mail that features the “good catch” of the week, in which an error was detected and reported before it had the potential to cause harm. Any hospital employee can report these good catches. They range from a nurse’s realizing she received the wrong dose of medication from the pharmacy to a medical student’s stopping her patient from getting a procedure that the physician thought he had canceled in the new electronic ordering system. Obviously, the institution is also working on discovering how that error occurred to prevent similar ones. It is no easy task to change a culture, but this seems to be a good start. STEPHANIE WAPPEL Washington, Oct. 16, 2013   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The writer is a resident physician at Georgetown University Hospital.  As an ophthalmologist, I was surprised and touched by such an empathic opinion toward doctors, which is rare to see nowadays. I agree that egregious, life-changing errors should be compensated through malpractice suits, but I want to reassure patients that the medical community takes errors like these very seriously, and we now have many fail-safe mechanisms in place at most if not all hospitals. For example, a patient coming in for eye surgery gets asked by at least two people what eye is to be operated on. The doctor checks the consent form and then puts his or her initials above the eye to be operated on, and this is separately confirmed by a nurse. Once in the operating room, there is a “time out” during which all relevant information about what is being done to which side is read aloud and agreed upon. It takes a bit more time and marks up the patient’s face, but it’s well worth everyone’s peace of mind. LAURA COZZARELLI New York, Oct. 16, 2013  Mr. Levy’s plea not to punish doctors’ innocent mistakes would have more resonance if he had included a description of how the patient had been treated in the aftermath. At the very least, the hospital and doctor should have performed the correct operation at no cost to the patient. Beyond that, the patient should have been compensated for her additional recovery time, pain, discomfort and inconvenience caused by the doctor’s mistake.

But if the patient received anything short of what I have described, I should think that Mr. Levy would be on shaky ground in asking for absolution. NEIL M. SINGER Washington, Oct. 16, 2013  Mr. Levy contends that disciplining doctors for their mistakes will not make health care safer, and safety science agrees with him. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that while punitive action may reduce deliberate reckless behavior, it is not effective in reducing the occurrence of most types of human error. We also know this from our day-to-day lives, where inadvertent errors are common. For example, even though the consequences of locking one’s keys in the car are potentially severe, many people have made this error, some more than once. (Modern vehicle design has made it virtually impossible to lock one’s keys in the car.) If health care is to achieve safety successes seen in other high-risk industries such as aviation, we must learn to balance safety and accountability. For caregivers who knowingly and recklessly violate safe practice, discipline is the right course. But most errors that lead to patient harm occur because of bad systems or processes, not bad people. The current health care focus on personal blame has been tried for decades and is not making us safer. Instead, we need to turn our approach upside-down and recognize that bright, well-educated, skilled and well-intentioned providers will make errors. To become safer, we need to allow discussion of these errors — to understand them, learn from them and redesign our systems to reduce their likelihood and mitigate their consequences. We can’t do this unless doctors and nurses feel safe enough to be transparent about error. In the end we need to make a decision. Will we continue with the same ineffective approach to health care safety we’ve used so far? Or do we follow the lead of other safety-critical industries?

As a practicing family physician for 36 years, I have come to believe in the seven essential R’s of an apology: it should be Rapid (as in right away when the error is discovered), show true Remorse, Recognize explicitly the error, accept Responsibility, acknowledge the Repercussions for the patient, offer Restitution or repair, and close with a Repetition of the opening words: I’m sorry. I have never been sorry that I said I was sorry. PETER ELIAS Lewiston, Me., Oct. 16, 2013  Physicians have a powerful incentive to apologize when they make mistakes: doing so may decrease the likelihood that they’ll be sued. A study at the University of Michigan Health System that was published in the peer-reviewed journal Annals of Internal Medicine in 2010 showed that the average monthly rate of malpractice lawsuits fell by more than half after physicians routinely apologized for their errors and offered fair compensation to patients and their families. This is yet another vivid example of how taking the high road isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s the smart thing to do, too. BRUCE WEINSTEIN New York, Oct. 16, 2013 The writer is the author of the book “Ethical Intelligence.”  Doctors are human, and involved in that most human of sciences: medicine. The trouble with medical errors is that too much energy is focused on punishing those who make errors, and not enough in using those errors as opportunities to improve the delivery of care for everyone. Health care, as an industry, has often failed to police itself, letting surgeons who shouldn’t operate on a Honda open up people’s hearts. This issue will not be solved by lawyers, or by regulators. It will be resolved practitioner by practitioner, patient by patient, and system by system, through a dedication to admitting errors when they occur, forgiving the error, removing the incompetent from the mix, and all working together toward better reporting, better outcomes and accountability across the board.

CASEY QUINLAN Richmond, Va., Oct. 16, 2013  The Writer Responds This type of medical error evokes strong opinions, as it raises issue of fairness, competence, responsibility and accountability. Mr. Jacobson transforms my point about how to encourage reporting into an assertion about a lack of compassion. Not at all so. Any patient who is harmed deserves full disclosure, a sincere apology, appropriate compensation and an explanation of how the event will be studied to improve care in the hospital. I did not suggest that the medical malpractice legal process should be short-circuited. My point is that further punishment from the hospital is often counterproductive, if our goal is to reduce the likelihood of similar events in the future. Dr. Wappel raises the value of catching near misses. Having a way to catalog and mine these “almost” cases for information is an important part of a learning culture. As a general matter, if you can characterize an error or near miss by saying, “It could have happened to anybody,” that is a pretty good indication that it reflects a systemic, rather than a personal, problem.
