In both America and Britain, where Losey spent much of the balance of his career after being blacklisted in Hollywood, he specialized in stern, chilly, often enigmatic dramas that combined the political and the psychological. His favorite theme, most famously developed in a series of collaborations with the playwright Harold Pinter (“The Servant,” 1963; “Accident,” 1967), was that of the stranger taken into a seemingly stable household, where he or she begins to exert a cruel power over the other residents, with their mysterious acquiescence. It’s a theme that reappears in “The Romantic Englishwoman,” a 1975 Losey film that is just now appearing on American DVD. But this time Mr. Losey’s collaborator is the rather more witty and playful playwright Tom Stoppard, working with the novelist Thomas Wiseman on an adaptation of Mr. Wiseman’s 1971 book of the same name.

When the light shifts, we see the reflection of a woman looking out at the passing scenery — our heroine, Elizabeth (Glenda Jackson), the vaguely dissatisfied wife of the highly successful airport novelist Lewis Fielding (Michael Caine). She has briefly escaped her perfect home and perfect child to spend a few days among the wealthy and idle in the superannuated German resort of Baden-Baden.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Meanwhile, back in the leafy suburbs of London, Lewis has begun to fret and fantasize about his wife’s escape, imagining her in an erotic encounter in an elevator with a shadowy figure who strongly resembles Thomas. The Fieldings are strangely delighted when Thomas, on the run from some French gangsters he has crossed, turns up a few weeks later at their English home, professing to be an admirer of Lewis’s work (though he seems to have him confused with another Fielding, the one who wrote “Tom Jones”). Thomas moves in, shamelessly sponging off the Fieldings while he draws dangerously close to Elizabeth. For Lewis it is all grist for his current project, a screenplay for a German producer on that echt ’70s subject, the Woman in Search of Her Identity. Consciously or not, he seems to be willing his wife into infidelity. With his customary precision Losey lays out the contrasting locales of his film: the prosaic English country house, where Elizabeth attends to tedious domestic chores; the feverish interior of Lewis’s head, where he is manufacturing tawdry fictions based on his wife’s imagined infidelity; and exotic, erotic Continental Europe, which extends from the dark forests of Baden-Baden to the bright sun and sea of Nice, where the film’s mock thriller climax (which plays out just as if Lewis had conceived it) takes place. It’s a game of mirrors full of sly self-references. “Aren’t you sick of these foreign films?” Elizabeth asks Thomas on their way back from a premiere, blissfully unaware that her au pair (Béatrice Romand) is a member of Eric Rohmer’s stock company, and her companion is Luchino Visconti’s favorite emblem of decadent male beauty (“ The Damned ,” “ Ludwig ”). Thomas tartly responds in German, telling her he can’t stand those British and American films either.  Photo        Myrna Loy and William Gargan in “Night Flight,” from 1933.   Credit Warner Home Video    An overripe line from Lewis’s screenplay, “Women are an occupied country,” parodies the opening sentence of L. P. Hartley’s novel “The Go-Between,” adapted into a celebrated film by Losey and Pinter in 1970: “The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Elizabeth isn’t “occupied” as much as she is simply unnoticed by a husband who has come to take her for granted. The sado-masochistic games that Thomas introduces into the Fielding household don’t have the devastating effect that similar diversions do in other Losey films, but rather serve the healthy function of opening Lewis’s eyes to the very real woman he lives with. The mirror game continued long after the release of “ The Romantic Englishwoman .” In 1999 Mr. Wiseman published a novel, “Genius Jack,” that painted a bitter portrait of a filmmaker whose life closely resembled Losey’s. And that same year Stanley Kubrick’s “ Eyes Wide Shut ” offered strong echoes of the themes and structures of Losey’s work, as Kubrick’s films had done before. Uncharacteristic as it may be, “The Romantic Englishwoman” remains one of Losey’s most accomplished and engaging films.

The rights have now been cleared, and the film has reappeared from Warner Home Video as a mainstream (rather than Warner Archive) release. Conceived in the spirit of “Grand Hotel,” MGM’s smash of 1932, “Night Flight” is an all-star production that weaves together several independent plotlines to relate the epic tale of the first overnight mail flight across the Andes. The cast includes Clark Gable, Helen Hayes, Robert Montgomery, Myrna Loy and the brothers John and Lionel Barrymore. Apparently audiences didn’t respond to the multistory structure the second time around, and the film was reduced by 30 minutes after disappointing previews, giving it a distinctly brusque, truncated feel. Still, Brown displays his usual skill in framing star performances (Loy is particularly good as the fretful wife of an inexperienced pilot, played by the forgotten William Gargan), and the flying footage (shot by Elmer Dyer and Charles Marshall) is original and impressive.

It seems to have left a profound impression on the young Howard Hawks, then unhappily employed at MGM working on “ Today We Live ,” who lifted whole chunks of it for his 1939 classic “ Only Angels Have Wings .” (Warner Home Video, $19.98, not rated) UNKNOWN Liam Neeson continues his late career resurgence as an action hero, this time as a botanist on a business trip to Berlin who finds, after a car accident and some hospital time, that his life has been erased. With January Jones, Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella; Jaume Collet-Serra (“ Orphan ”) directed. “Despite its A-movie aspirations, as the chases continue and the plot holes widen, ‘Unknown’ quickly settles into the familiar B-movie comfort zone, with mano-a-mano fights, missed phone calls, running and more running, and a twist that keeps twisting until it breaks,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times in February. (Warner Home Video, Blu-ray/DVD combo $35.99, Blu-ray $29.98, DVD $28.98, PG-13) THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU Mysterious men in hats attempt to manage the destiny of a promising young politician (Matt Damon), who for cosmic reasons must be prevented from having a romance with a promising young dancer (Emily Blunt). George Nolfi directed from a story by Philip K. Dick. Writing in The Times in March Ms. Dargis called this a “witty mix of science-fiction metaphysics and old-fashioned fluttery romance.” (Universal, Blu-ray $39.98, DVD $29.98, PG-13) MEDIUM: THE SEVENTH AND FINAL SEASON The last 13 episodes of the popular series starring Patricia Arquette as a psychic soccer mom who works as a consultant for the district attorney’s office in Phoenix.

Vincent Canby, writing in The Times in 1991, found this to be “an imaginative film” that “is eventually overwhelmed by its ambitions.” (Zeitgeist, $29.99, not rated)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   CEDAR RAPIDS In this comedy a small-town insurance agent named Tim (Ed Helms) goes on his first trip ever — to attend a convention in the Iowa city of the title. John C. Reilly, Anne Heche and Isiah Whitlock Jr. are the veterans who show him the ropes. Miguel Arteta directed from a script by Phil Johnston. “Tim travels a classic path of enlightenment that runs parallel with our own understanding of him,” Ms. Dargis wrote in The Times in February. “It’s a modest journey of a modest man that Mr. Arteta smartly doesn’t inflate.” (Fox Searchlight, Blu-ray $39.99, DVD $29.98, R)   A version of this article appears in print on June 19, 2011, on Page AR14 of the New York edition with the headline: Joseph Losey’s Dark Hall Of Extramarital Mirrors.
