David M. Leuschen, a specialist in oil and energy at Goldman Sachs, wanted a partner to help him lure big investors. Together, they created the Carlyle/Riverstone energy investment fund back in 2000 and brought in billions of dollars from state pension funds. And together, they have earned the wrath of the New York attorney general in his investigation of corruption by state officials and investment firms. With the help of intermediaries who had political connections, Mr. Leuschen approached state pension funds in New York and elsewhere to invest in Carlyle/Riverstone.

But while scooping up such multimillion-dollar victories, he also paid millions of dollars to pension intermediaries working in New York and other states. Paying intermediaries, known as placement agents, is legal unless those fees are simply a disguised form of a bribe or a kickback. Several people paid by Mr. Leuschen’s firm have pleaded guilty or been charged in the New York scandal in recent weeks for essentially arranging bribes. Federal securities officials have described the New York payments as part of a “fraudulent scheme to extract kickbacks.” Bowing to the pressure, the Carlyle Group agreed on Thursday to pay $20 million and to stop paying placement fees as part of a broad settlement with Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who hopes it will serve as a template for broader reform in the industry. Mr. Leuschen and his firm, Riverstone Holdings, have not been charged, but remain under investigation in the widening corruption scandal, which involves not only New York investigators and the Securities and Exchange Commission, but also attorneys general in dozens of states. “Riverstone was a partner of Carlyle and most of the objectionable activities were by Riverstone,” Mr. Cuomo said during a teleconference on Thursday announcing the Carlyle settlement. “But in our opinion, Carlyle was a partner of Riverstone and therefore responsible for Riverstone, and Carlyle is taking responsibility.” Mr. Leuschen, a fourth-generation Montanan, knew the oil and energy business and had an M.B.A. from Dartmouth. His star rose over 22 years at Goldman Sachs, where he helped advise Mobil on its $81 billion merger with Exxon and lined up other oil-rich clients before deciding to strike out on his own. With two others from Goldman, he started Riverstone Holdings.

It also had a global network of deep-pocketed investors. Just as Mr. Leuschen was teaming up with Carlyle in 2000, he got a side piece of business from a neighbor, Barrett Wissman, an entrepreneur who had a ranch next to his in Red Lodge, Mont., and who managed money for the Hunt family of Texas. Mr. Wissman put Mr. Leuschen on the board of the eVentures Group, an Internet start-up, saying in a press release that he was “extremely excited” to have him. That assignment lasted for about a year.  Photo        Andrew Cuomo, shown in December, announced a settlement Thursday with the Carlyle Group.   Credit Mike Groll/Associated Press    In its filings, the S.E.C. said that when Mr. Wissman heard that the New York State Common Retirement Fund was interested in making energy sector investments, he contacted his Montana neighbor. Carlyle/Riverstone paid Mr. Wissman $5 million for helping arrange a $500 million investment by the New York fund. Under an agreement with Mr. Wissman to split fees, Hank Morris, a longtime New York political consultant ,  also received $5 million from Carlyle/Riverstone. In addition, Mr. Leuschen personally invested $100,000 in a low-budget movie about Italian-Americans called “Chooch,” made by David J. Loglisci, a former New York state pension official, and his brothers. After Mr. Leuschen put money in the film, Mr. Loglisci directed $30 million in pension business to Carlyle/Riverstone, according to the S.E.C.

Mr. Wissman has pleaded guilty in the inquiry and agreed to pay a $12 million fine. The payments to middlemen by Carlyle/Riverstone came about, according to the S.E.C., even though Carlyle, one of the most sophisticated investment funds in the world, “had its own in-house marketing operation and was spearheading the marketing efforts for the Carlyle/Riverstone fund.” Other Carlyle funds have been ensnared. The attorney general’s office said Carlyle Realty Partners and Carlyle Europe Real Estate Partners used the same middlemen as Riverstone in New York. In all, Carlyle paid over $13 million in “sham placement fees” as it gathered $730 million from the New York State pension fund, according to that office. Jeffrey Taufield, a spokesman for Carlyle/Riverstone, said that the firm had no comment. Mr. Leuschen had no comment.

Along with the Montana ranch, he owns 200,000 acres of pristine countryside outside Yellowstone National Park where he operates Switchback Ranch — and he has invited Carlyle, Goldman and energy industry executives, as well as potential investors, to visit. Switchback’s Web site notes that executives can hunt antelope and bighorn sheep by day and “share cocktails, first-class meals, and entertainment with new friends,” at “luxurious five-star” accommodations — including hot tubs — at night. Mr. Leuschen serves on the board of the Buffalo Bill Museum in nearby Cody, Wyo. Fellow trustees include former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Senator Alan K. Simpson and Ray Hunt of Texas, and its $145 million endowment is managed by Fayez Sarofim of Texas. Mr. Leuschen’s first fund, formerly the Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power Fund I, started out at a relatively small $222 million. But its investing success quickly put the joint venture into the big leagues. A year later, Mr. Leuschen was closing a $1 billion energy fund and getting money from such leading funds as Calpers, the California public employees fund, and its sister fund for teachers, Calstrs. Those two California funds would eventually invest $1.2 billion in the joint venture’s funds. “Their track record was phenomenal,” said a pension fund consultant, who requested anonymity because he works with many Carlyle clients. “Carlyle/Riverstone went from zero to something in a short time.” Mr. Leuschen, in his 2005 presentation in New Mexico, said he had put $100 million of his own money in his funds. Many of his six funds have had annual returns in the 60 percent to 80 percent range, while the more recent funds have lost money in the energy slump, according to public documents. As his success grew, so did his influential rainmakers. He hired John Browne, the former chief executive of BP, the global energy company, to head a London office. Former Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana was named to the Carlyle/Riverstone board. Other major pension funds investing in Carlyle/Riverstone include the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the New York State Teachers Retirement Systemtirement System#8217; Retirement System of the State of Illinois, Ohio State University, the Delaware Public Employees Retirement System and the San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System. Many of these funds said they invested in Carlyle/Riverstone without the use of a middleman or placement agent.   Danny Hakim contributed reporting.
