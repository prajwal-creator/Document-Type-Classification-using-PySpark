FISCHLER FEB. 25, 2007     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           AFTER watching an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy,” Sarah Grace McCandless, 32, a novelist from Washington, went shopping. The $160 Citizens for Humanity jeans that she bought online had a special appeal that wasn’t about the label. “I bought jeans that Meredith was wearing,” said Ms. McCandless, a self-described pop culture addict, referring to the character Meredith Grey. “I don’t have Meredith’s body, but you can order them in different sizes.” Ms. McCandless also has a pair of the True Religion jeans that Izzie wore, along with brown boots like the pair from Frye worn by Cristina, also characters on “Grey’s Anatomy.” Ms. Candless shops on SeenON.com (also known as SeenON!), one of a cluster of TV- and movie-themed Web sites offering breathless behind-the-scenes chatter, as well as instant gratification for those with a taste for celebrity style. Fans are now just clicks away from owning not only the clothes and accessories worn by characters on more than 100 television shows and movies, but also the sofas they sit on and the martini glasses they drink from.

But, until recently, viewers had to work at identifying the shoes or earrings characters wore.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Because of the Internet, the selling of more than 20,000 products that are not easily recognizable or never identified in a script, called shopping-enabled entertainment, is taking off, driven by consumerism and celebrity worship. “There are thousands and thousands of products that are naturally embedded in these shows,” said Ashley Heather, a new-media entrepreneur and chief executive of Entertainment Media Works, which last March started an entertainment shopping site, StarStyle.com . StarStyle lets fans buy a soup-tureen set from Nora Walker’s pantry on the ABC series “Brothers & Sisters,” the polka-dot halter dress like the one that Diane Keaton’s Daphne character wears in the film “Because I Said So” or a velvet blazer like the one Taylor Hicks wore on “American Idol.” (Many products are the same as what the stars wore, but sometimes a similar, less expensive version is offered, and identified as such.) Viewers can shop by show, character, product or brand. Starting Tuesday, SeenON! will feature a “Look for Less” Oscar tie-in, selling versions of the dresses, shoes and earrings worn on the red carpet.

Taken to the extreme, the idea of selling clothes right from the backs of drama queens offers the possibility of endless moneymaking, involving online sites, traditional retailers, manufacturers, production companies and networks in an incestuous web of marketing and sales. It may not be too far-fetched to imagine a day when “Desperate Housewives” spins off Desperate Housewares, a line of products made for the show, written into the show and then sold off through a Web site. Explicit product placement generates $4 billion, Web site executives said, and some have estimated that extending this model to things like clothing that is incorporated into a set but never identified creates a market potentially worth $100 billion.

StarStyle has deals with about 25 networks, shows and studios, including FremantleMedia, the producer of “American Idol”; MTV’s “Real World: Key West”; and daytime soap operas like “The Young and the Restless.” The site also markets apparel and accessories from music videos. Shoppers can click on an item on the site, which links them to retailer sites like Nordstrom, Macy’s and the Gap to make the purchase. At SeenON!, some of the most-viewed items are the Gucci 85th anniversary bag from “Ugly Betty,” Meredith Grey’s JBrand jeans and Gabrielle’s Aldo purse from “Desperate Housewives.” At StarBrand.tv, the top sellers include the Adriano Goldschmied jeans that Rory wears this season on “Gilmore Girls” and the Lucky Brand belts worn by Veronica on “Veronica Mars.” Not surprisingly, most shoppers on these sites are women ages 18 to 34.

When Carrie Bradshaw wore stilettos on “Sex and the City,” viewers hungrily eyed her Manolo Blahniks and made the brand a household name. The new Web sites are not just for fashionistas, though. In recent months, Ms. McCandless purchased the dishwashing gloves and Tupperware set used by Bree on “Desperate Housewives” as a shower gift, and is hankering for Bree’s Bosch washing machine and dryer — all of which can be ordered, along with the Benjamin Moore paint on Bree’s walls — through an online tour of the “Housewives” homes on SeenON.com. While none of the Web sites would disclose revenues, they said they made money through commissions on sales and profit-sharing with their network partners. SeenON! sometimes acts as a direct retailer, buying products wholesale from manufacturers, then selling them at retail and sharing the profit with the show or network. (SeenON! also runs about 40  stores for Web sites including for ABC, NBC and ET Online; it started its own site in December.) Bruce Gersh, senior vice president for business development for ABC Entertainment, said that for a few years, the network has been heading in this direction, placing, say, jewelry on characters in daytime dramas, then encouraging viewers to visit abc.com to buy copies.

Baylen for The New York Times    More recently, prime-time goodies, like Betty’s paisley pajama pants from “Ugly Betty” and Lynette’s J. Crew cashmere hoodie from “Desperate Housewives,” were on abc.com and SeenON!, and Mr. Gersh said sales from this type of commerce have been “growing steadily.” WEB site executives said products are not intentionally placed on shows, but that doesn’t mean nobody is trying. Some sites are pushing for cross-pollination — offering producers and stylists a look-book of brands where they can order products for shows for free. And those who dress the sets and the stars say they are suddenly being bombarded by brands that want exposure.

Nonetheless, she said, she is aware that how she dresses Howie Mandel and the show’s models influences people when they shop. Seeing it on a recognized figure, she said, “takes the guesswork out of, ‘Is this O.K.?’ ” Mike Fitzsimmons, the founder of Delivery Agent, which runs SeenON!, said his company doesn’t try to do the job of the professionals. “The costume designers and the stylists behind the scenes, they truly are the trend drivers in our pop culture environment,” he said. William B. Helmreich, a professor of the sociology of consumer behavior at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center, said that shopping-enabled entertainment is par for the course in a celebrity-obsessed culture. “It is called the game of realizing your fantasies to a minimum extent,” Dr. Helmreich said. “They are not only getting satisfaction from wearing the item, they are also sending a message to other people about who they are, that they are like a star.” Indeed, Kathryn Hnatio, 29, an account manager in Manhattan, was smitten by a “flirty but fun” dress worn by Katharine McPhee on “American Idol.” When she wore a similar, less-expensive version she bought on StarStyle.com, friends complimented her and, she said, “Everyone recognized it because they were watching the show, too.” But if everyone recognizes it and can buy it just as easily, is it still special? “You have the potential of killing the goose that laid the golden egg,” Dr. Helmreich said. “Cachet has to do with availability.” The risk is that people will eventually focus more on the stuff than the story. Lauren Honig, 23, an executive assistant in Manhattan, bought a $595  Botkier bag through StarStyle.com  after noticing Holly Harper carrying it on “Brothers & Sisters.” The ability to shop from television shows “definitely opens new doors,” Ms. Honig said. “I am paying more attention to what they are wearing in the shows rather than the plot.”   A version of this article appears in print on , on Page ST1 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ ... and Closet.
