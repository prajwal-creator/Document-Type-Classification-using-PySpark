HERSZENHORN DEC. 30, 2005     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           A flair for high-society smooching has not always been an essential skill in running New York City's public schools. But there was Joel I. Klein, the schools chancellor, at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse, grinning awkwardly as he blew a kiss across the room to Elizabeth Rohatyn, the philanthropist and wife of the former ambassador to France. The moment occurred at a November luncheon debate about education whose guests included fashionistas, artists, wealthy businessmen or, in many cases, their wealthy wives, and it captured how, in remaking the school system, Mr. Klein and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg have forged a close bond with the private sector, raising $311 million and turning public education into a darling cause of the corporate-philanthropic-society set. "When I went out 10 years ago to dinners, I rarely ever spoke about what I was doing in education," said Mrs. Rohatyn, who in 1994 founded Teaching Matters, a nonprofit organization that advocates better use of technology in schools. "I find that's very different now. People want to engage in it. They want to talk about it. They are enthused." They are also known. The host for the luncheon was Sir Harold Evans, the former president of Random House, and the event was sponsored by the magazine The Week, where Sir Harold is editor at large. Guests included the fashion designer Mary McFadden; the performance artist Karen Finley; the photographer Dominique Nabokov; the mayor's companion, Diana Taylor; and a Republican candidate for governor, William F. Weld.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       "There is a club of people in New York that support just about everything -- the museums, the libraries," said Merryl H. Tisch, a member of the state's Board of Regents whose husband, James S. Tisch, is chief executive of Loews Corporation and whose family cuts a wide swath in philanthropic circles. "Now, because Michael has such a good name and is so reputable, they are able to transfer that club into the school system." In the context of the system's regular budget of about $15 billion a year, $311 million might seem insignificant. But the tax dollars come with so many strings that the administration has viewed private money as crucial for research and development and an array of experimental programs. "You are able to do it without saying this is money that is going to come out of the classroom," Mr. Klein said in an interview. So far, the mayor's and the chancellor's collections include more than $117 million to start new small schools; nearly $70 million to open an academy for principal training; $41 million for the nonprofit center supporting charter schools; $11.5 million to renovate libraries; $8.3 million to refurbish playgrounds; and $5.7 million to reshape troubled high schools. Donors include the media barons Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Rupert Murdoch; the venture capitalist Russell L. Carson; the hedge fund manager turned vintner Julian H. Robertson Jr.; and Julie Gaines, a co-owner of Fishs Eddy, a chain of dishware stores. These are people who can reach Mr. Klein by cellphone, and whose e-mail merits a prompt reply even from a schools chief who takes pride in answering all messages. "It's so different working with him," said Carol F. Reich, who with her husband, Joseph H. Reich, donated $10 million through their Pumpkin Foundation to help the chancellor create a nonprofit group called the New York City Center for Charter School Excellence. In an interview over tea and doughnuts in the couple's Midtown office, she said: "He takes your phone calls. If you call him on the -- what's that fruit? BlackBerry -- if you call him on the BlackBerry you get an immediate response. It's a whole different world."   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   She should know. In the early 90's, the Reichs had to fight for months to donate a building for a public school in Brooklyn. Mr. Klein, by contrast, phoned them unsolicited during his first year in office. Knowing them only by reputation, he asked to visit their Upper West Side apartment after hearing that Mr. Reich had been ill. Mr. and Mrs. Reich said they were immediately impressed and praised Mr. Klein for his "menschiness." They also said many of the recent donors to the public schools were motivated partly by a kinship they feel with the mayor and the chancellor. "It's people like Mike Bloomberg who built enterprises themselves," said Mr. Reich, who made his fortune as an investor. "They are used to doing things where they see the results of their efforts. They understand what Joel and the mayor are trying to do." "I think there's self-recognition," Mrs. Reich added. "We can look at the mayor and Joel and say, 'Oh, you're kind of like us.' This is not inherited wealth." New money or old, donors have been enthusiastic enough to write seven- and eight-figure checks. As a result, the school system has been the largest beneficiary in a mayoralty that has reached to the private sector, strategically and aggressively, for all sorts of support. While Mr. Bloomberg's personal philanthropy has turned sharply toward grass-roots organizations in recent years, with the obvious political benefits, the donations by his friends and acquaintances in the clubby world of wealthy philanthropists have turned just as markedly toward the mayor's No. 1 priority: public education. By comparison, the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, the administration's wider fund-raising operation, has raised a total of about $60 million, City Hall officials said. By far the largest sums for education came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to start small schools, with much of its gifts channeled through nonprofit groups. Other big givers include the Wallace Foundation; the Partnership for New York City, a business group; the Broad Foundation; the Robin Hood Foundation, the Pumpkin Foundation and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation. Corporate donors include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

"I come from the business world; I'm used to a world where there is freedom and accountability and that never seemed to exist in the world of public education," Mr. Reich said.

Riggio, the chairman and founder of Barnes & Noble, who recently led an effort that raised more than $10 million for his alma mater, Brooklyn Technical High School, said he viewed the mayor and chancellor as "enlightened capitalists" who are doing good works. "I accept them as volunteers," said Mr. Riggio, sitting at a conference table in his sleek downtown office filled with modern art. "The very notion of a dynamic entrepreneur is that they want to make something happen," he continued, sipping from a demitasse of espresso served by an aide in chef's whites. "They want to be part of a movement. As mayor he believes in the ideal of these public-private partnerships." Individual donors and foundation officers alike praised Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Klein for reinvigorating the Fund for Public Schools, a previously threadbare operation that collects donations for the schools. Leslie Koch, the fund's chief executive, is paid $220,000 a year. After becoming chancellor in 2002, Mr. Klein created an Office of Strategic Partnerships and imposed on his wife's college friend, Caroline Kennedy, to serve as its chief executive. Mr. Klein made the pitch while visiting Ms. Kennedy and her husband, Edwin A. Schlossberg, on Martha's Vineyard. Ms. Kennedy, who led the office for nearly two years, remains involved as vice chairwoman of the Fund for Public Schools. In 2000 and 2001, the fund reported donations of just under $3 million each year. Since Mr. Bloomberg took office, the fund has collected more than $122 million. In some ways, the schools are now eclipsing other popular city institutions. In 2004, for instance, the fund took in $54.9 million, while the New York Public Library received about $39 million and the Central Park Conservancy received about $16.5 million. Some of the new big givers had never given to public schools before. "I made financial grants to both N.Y.U. and Columbia but never to the public school system," said Mr. Zuckerman, the publisher of The Daily News, who recently gave $1.5 million to create an academically selective high school and who is vice chairman of the Fund for Public Schools.

Nevertheless, they all expressed concern about public education and the implications for their businesses and the city's future and said that was driving their giving. "It gives people skin in the game," Mr. Klein said. "They have a sense that they have more than a civic investment. They now have a financial investment." The chancellor said the donations were evidence of excitement about the administration's work. "It started with mayoral control and a real sense that the mayor was going to try to do something significant," he said. "I think that sent a signal to the philanthropic and the corporate community." The investments are only growing. Just two weeks after winning re-election, Mr. Bloomberg announced $24 million in additional donations for high school initiatives. The Wallace Foundation, which has given $32 million since Mr. Bloomberg took office to support initiatives for schoolchildren, will soon announce another gift, $1.05 million for arts education. The level of private donations has raised some cautionary questions. Eva S. Moskowitz, the chairwoman of the City Council Education Committee, said that the efforts were praiseworthy but that the amount was so considerable that "there needs to be a way to evaluate the effectiveness." It may be too early to judge the outcome, but it is clear is that while Mr. Bloomberg's overhaul of the schools has, at times, bewildered parents and infuriated educators, it has received only the warmest embrace from leaders of corporations and foundations, a world in which the mayor was a titan before winning office. "The mayor is one of the city's biggest philanthropists; frankly he had a lot of chits to call in," said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City. "Because he is known as one of the most generous people when it comes to other people's causes, when he said, 'Education is my priority and I want you to support it,' " Ms. Wylde said, "he was calling in his i.o.u.'s, and equally there was a great deal of confidence that Joel was going to focus the philanthropy on a handful of key priorities."
