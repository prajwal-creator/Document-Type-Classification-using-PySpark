''The outbreaks we have seen this season have involved all age groups from the very young to the elderly,'' said Dr. Karl Kappus of the centers' influenza surveillance branch. He said the outbreaks involved type A-Philippine influenza. He said ''it is time'' for people at high risk, those over 65 years old and those with chronic diseases, to be immunized against this type and other active strains. The current flu vaccine gives protection against the three circulating strains, A-Philippine as well as the B-type and A-Brazil varieties.

In the 1980-81 epidemic caused by the A-Bangkok flu virus, blamed for about 55,000 deaths nationally over 12 to 14 weeks, the percentage of deaths due to flu and influenza peaked at 7 percent. Dr. Kappus said the drug amantadine was helpful in warding off influenza infection until a person's flu shot takes effect about two weeks after inoculation.
