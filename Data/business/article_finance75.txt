Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times     (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up .) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Pivotal day for Republicans. The Republican Party’s presidential candidates will be in Boulder, Colo., tonight for their third debate, with a focus on economic issues (8 p.m. Eastern, CNBC). The dynamics of the debate may be altered because there is a new front-runner in the polls, Ben Carson . And House Republicans hold a conference vote today on whether to select Paul D. Ryan to succeed John A. Boehner as speaker. The full House votes on Thursday, Mr. Boehner’s last day after almost five years as speaker.

Iran will join the U.S. and Russia in Vienna on Thursday and Friday for talks about the Syrian civil war, the state news media in Tehran reported today.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Russia has urged the inclusion of Iran, the only other power supporting the Syrian president, and American officials recently acknowledged a need for Tehran in any discussions of a political succession plan. • Ex-speaker Hastert’s plea. J. Dennis Hastert, the former House speaker, pleaded guilty today to federal charges of evading bank rules on large cash transactions. The plea is in connection with accusations that the Republican agreed to pay $3.5 million in hush money to hide claims of past sexual misconduct and that he lied about it to the F.B.I. Prosecutors recommended zero to six months in prison, but the judge said Mr. Hastert, 73, could face up to five years when he is sentenced in February. • Life as an ISIS captive. In their first interviews, four Arab prisoners of the Islamic State militant group who were freed in a military raid last week described their beatings and torture as well as daily life under exacting restrictions. (Earlier, we incorrectly said the interviews were with dozens of prisoners.) On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said ground raids would be launched , if necessary, to target the extremist group. • Next steps for the budget. The House vote on the government’s budget plan is due today, but Senate action is not yet nailed down.

The Justice Department will investigate an attack at a high school in Columbia, S.C. , in which a white police officer is seen in a video pulling a black female student backward in her desk and dragging her. BUSINESS • Volkswagen today posted its first decline in quarterly profit in more than a decade, as it set aside $7.4 billion to help cover the fallout from the company’s emissions-cheating scandal . • Walgreens is snapping up another pharmacy chain, Rite Aid, for $9.4 billion , but this combination may draw U.S. government antitrust scrutiny. • Most economists expect no change from the Federal Reserve today, as the case for increasing interest rates has weakened since the summer. • Northrop Grumman , maker of the B-2 bomber, beat a Boeing-Lockheed Martin team to win the Pentagon’s biggest contract in more than 10 years. The contract for the next long-range strike bomber starts at $21.4 billion. • Wall Street  stocks  are rising . European shares ended about 1 percent higher, and Asia indexes closed mostly lower. NOTEWORTHY • Kansas City grabs the lead. Early this morning, Eric Hosmer drove in the winning run in the bottom of the 14th inning, as the Royals edged the Mets , 5-4, in the longest Game 1 in World Series history.

NASA’s Cassini spacecraft today dives through an icy spray erupting from the Saturn moon Enceladus, looking for evidence of water and thus possible life. • Student test scores slip in U.S. The math skills of American students have dropped for the first time since 1990, according to results of a nationwide test released today by the Education Department. Officials said the decline in scores was unexpected, but that it could be related to changes ushered in by the Common Core standards. • Harassment in game culture. SXSW Interactive , the annual tech gathering in Austin, Tex., is facing a backlash over a decision to cancel two panels on video games. They were expected to touch on GamerGate, a loosely connected online movement of self-described video game fans who have lashed back aggressively online at criticism about sexism in gaming culture. • Retiring is now her goal. Abby Wambach, the leading scorer in international soccer history with 184 goals, says she is retiring at the end of the year. BACK STORY We’ve been down this road before: Federal highway funding is expected to run out on Thursday. Ho-hum.  Photo        Federal highway funding is expected to run out on Thursday.   Credit Brendan Bannon for The New York Times    In the end, we expect Congress to come through with another extension to let the Highway Trust Fund finance transportation infrastructure improvements. Those are badly needed, as American roads get a D grade from civil engineers.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The nation’s poor roads led President Dwight D. Eisenhower to support the Federal-Aid Highway Act in 1956, authorizing the creation of what came to be more than 45,000 miles of mostly toll-free high-speed roads. Mr. Eisenhower’s passion for better roads went back to 1919. As a young military officer after World War I, he was part of an 80-vehicle military convoy that took 62 days to travel to San Francisco from Washington . (Earlier, we incorrectly said Mr. Eisenhower served as a young lieutenant general in 1919 and implied that he did his World War I service overseas.) The vehicles took a beating on the mostly unpaved roads, when they weren’t slipping into a ditch or getting blown off a cliff. Crossing water sometimes meant building a bridge. “Difficult, tiring, and fun,” is what he called the trip, made at an average crawl of 6 miles per hour. Mr. Eisenhower’s unforgettable road trip in 1919 ended up being a boon for American drivers. Victoria Shannon contributed reporting.
