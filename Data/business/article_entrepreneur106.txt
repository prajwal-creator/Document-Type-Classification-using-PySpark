Experts Offer Three Profiles   By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN OCT. 16, 2002     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           Who is the phantom sniper? An icy loner? A macho hunter? A teenager with a friend? As investigators crawl on their hands and knees through shopping center parking lots for any shred of evidence, any insight into the gunman's mind or identity, psychiatrists, psychologists, private detectives and academics are drawing their own conclusions. From the same distressingly meager set of clues, there are three radically different portraits, underscoring the reality that no one seemed really to know who the gunman is. First, there is the aggressive hunter. ''I don't see this guy as wimpy,'' said Candice DeLong, a former profiler for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who worked on the Unabomber case. ''I see him all into this stealth ninja stuff, walking around with a swagger, used to bossing people around, maybe a fireman or construction worker. He's out to prove to somebody -- and they know who they are -- that he's the best damn sniper in the world.'' And he is getting bolder, Mrs. DeLong said. On Monday night, a woman standing right next to her husband was shot dead outside a bustling Home Depot. It was the ninth killing.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       ''A game, that's what this is, a sick game,'' Mr. Dietl said today. ''There's probably two skinny kids out there who have made a pact with each other. They're shooting bodies and getting away, shooting bodies and getting away. They don't want to confront anybody face to face.'' Finally, there is the most familiar type: the icy loner. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said most serial killers are lonely white men in their 30's. ''It sounds cliché, but it's usually true,'' Dr. Fox said. ''And in this case, we're seeing typical commando behavior. It's probably some introverted guy living by himself, working by himself, living out the ultimate fantasy. This is his battle, his war, and he's the colonel now.'' The roughly two dozen experts consulted for this article agreed on several things. The sniper is male, they said, drawing the inference -- and that is all criminal profilers really do -- from history and the male-dominated gun culture. Many experts think there is only one gunman, not two, despite some witness reports that the gunman may have had a driver. ''The card said 'I am God,' not 'We are God,' '' Dr. Fox said, referring to one of the few concrete clues in the case, a tarot card left in the woods near one of the shootings. Past cases show that the vast majority of serial killers have operated solo -- unless the killer is a teenager.

''If he were hearing voices and seeing things, he'd be in jail by now,'' said Robert B. Levin, a prison psychiatrist in Soledad, Calif. ''He may be a bit delusional, but a full blown schizophrenic would be too disorganized to keep eluding the cops.'' The sniper probably has a job or lifestyle that requires him to be somewhere on weekends. Of the 11 shootings since Oct. 2, with nine killed and two wounded, none occurred on a Saturday or Sunday. With terrorism fears running high, many people in the Washington area are wondering if the sniper is a foreign agent. Most experts said he was not. ''If this were the work of Al Qaeda or some group like that, they would be proud to claim it,'' Mr. Dietl said. Many of the people consulted for this article were reluctant to say too much, mindful that the sniper seems to be taking cues from the media. Three days after Chief Charles A. Moose of the Montgomery County Police said on the ''Today'' show that schools were safe, a 13-year-old boy was shot in the chest outside his Bowie, Md., middle school. He remains in critical condition.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

It can be used in conjunction with other evidence to narrow the field of suspects. As Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist who has analyzed several serial murderers, said, ''ultimately, it's tips that solve these crimes, not profilers.'' The sniper case has been especially tough to crack because the choice of victims appears so random: an entrepreneur from Philadelphia, a woman sitting on a park bench, a boy going to school. Most serial killers target a certain type. David Berkowitz, known as Son of Sam, went after necking couples. Ted Bundy preyed on brunettes with a certain part in their hair. In this case, each victim was shot, just once, apparently with the same high-powered military or hunting rifle. Experts dispute how difficult this would be. Mr. Dietl said it took all of one afternoon to teach his 12-year-old how to hit a target in the torso from 200 yards away.

''One shot, one kill,'' he said. ''That's pretty frightening marksmanship.'' Those within the sniper subculture said the gunman probably did not have a military background, because if he did he would have chosen the larger and more accurate .308-cailber bullet that the military issues, not a .223. Dr. Meloy said serial killers and mass murderers share certain traits. ''Foremost is their sense of entitlement to take life,'' Dr. Meloy explained. ''The killer can't just be angry at the world or have suffered deep humiliation. A lot of people are like that. The killer must feel entitled to kill.'' Most snipers live alone and have problems connecting to other people, said Dr. Fox, the Northeastern University criminologist. Within his database of hundreds of serial killers is a list of 514 sniper homicides between 1976 and 2000. Ninety-four percent of the killers are men; 55 percent white; 91 percent under 40. The average age is 26. The method of killing corresponds to the reclusive personality. Sniping is a way to dispatch victims without having to interact with them, without seeing them in pain. This sniper has avoided shooting most of his victims in the head, striking the chest instead. Some take that as a clue. ''Maybe he doesn't want to look them in the eye,'' said Kris Mohandie, a criminal psychologist in Los Angeles. There's even a term in psychology called a ''sniper mentality,'' said W. Scott Thornsley, a criminologist at Mansfield University in Pennsylvania. ''It's used for people who want to distance themselves,'' he said . Mrs. DeLong, a 20-year FBI veteran, and one of the only women in the criminal profile business, said the sniper was probably a person others think of as macho, as indicated by the brazen, precise way he has shot his victims, sometimes with police officers nearby.

''He probably comes home after he kills, flips on the TV and pops a beer.'' Historically, teenagers have been behind 32 percent of sniper attacks, Dr. Fox said. ''But kids kill impulsively, they strike back at bullies, nothing this organized,'' he said. Dr. Fox also said 40 percent of sniper attacks remain unsolved.
