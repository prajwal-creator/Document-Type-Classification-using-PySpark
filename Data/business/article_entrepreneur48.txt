(ABC) DREAMGIRLS (2006) Three Detroit singers, portrayed, above from left, by Anika Noni Rose, Beyoncé Knowles and Jennifer Hudson, discover the price of fame in Bill Condon’s adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same title. Jamie Foxx plays the musical entrepreneur who trades in Effie White (Ms. Hudson, in her Oscar-winning role), the lead singer of the Dreamettes, for her thinner, lighter-skinned sidekick, Deena Jones (Ms. Knowles). Eddie Murphy won an Oscar nomination for his turn as James (Thunder) Early, a soul man loosely based on James Brown. The film’s dramatic and musical peak — “the showstopper, the main reason to see the movie” — comes midpoint when Ms. Hudson sings “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “That song has been this musical’s calling card since the first Broadway production 25 years ago, but to see Ms. Hudson tear into it on screen nonetheless brings the goose-bumped thrill of witnessing something new, even historic.” Nevertheless, he wrote, “the music has the effect of compromising one of the crucial ambitions of the film: to refract the recent history of black America (and, by implication, America itself) through the prism of popular culture.” NOON (13) RICHARD HEFFNER’S OPEN MIND Robert A. Caro concludes the discussion of the fourth volume of his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Lyndon B. Johnson. 8 P.M. (HBO) WANDERLUST (2012) Jennifer Aniston, below right, and Paul Rudd star as Linda and George, out-of-work Manhattanites unable to sell their “microloft” in the West Village. Then they stumble onto Elysium, an “intentional community” in rural Georgia, where good vibrations — and not a little smoke — fill the air, and the only blackberries grow on trees. Established decades earlier by Carvin (Alan Alda), now in a wheelchair and battling memory loss, and his hippie friends, the commune is home to a touchy-feely, guitar-strumming collage led by Seth (Justin Theroux), a creepy Lothario, and a novelist and nudist (Joe Lo Truglio) who wears the occasional sanitary pouch (like a hairnet, but lower) when he’s crushing grapes for homemade wine. “Part of what gives this movie unexpected resonance is that Linda and George have joined only somewhat voluntarily,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times about this “mostly funny comedy” from David Wain. “Like other Americans seeking simplicity and maybe a chicken coop out back, they want off the road, at least for a while. There’s something touching about this desire, though Mr. Wain doesn’t let Linda and George fly their freak flags for long.” 9 P.M. (CUNY) GOODBYE MOMO (2005) Obdulio (Mathias Acuña), an 11-year-old Afro-Uruguayan boy, lives with his grandmother (Carmen Abella) and sells newspapers for a living, though he refuses to learn to read or write. But then the newspaper’s watchman (Jorge Esmoris) starts scrawling the lyrics to the songs of the Murgas, a troupe of traveling singers with whom Obdulio is obsessed, on a chalkboard.

(CBS) VANITY FAIR’S HOLLYWOOD CBS News looks at the planning of the magazine’s 20th-anniversary Oscar party as well as some of the year’s top entertainment stories in its annual Hollywood issue and the largest celebrity photo shoot in its history. 10 P.M.

(13) ONCE (2007) Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, below, play a street musician and a young Czech woman in Dublin who establish a creative partnership — and a deeper, riskier bond. This movie, written and directed by John Carney, “is not a film with any great ambitions to declare, or any knotty themes to articulate,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. “It celebrates doggedness, good-humored discipline and desire — the desire not only to write a song or make a recording, but the deeper longing for communication that underlies any worthwhile artistic effort.” Still, he wrote, “the special poignancy of the movie, the happy-sad feeling it leaves in its wake, comes from its acknowledgment that the satisfaction of these aspirations is usually transient, even as it can sometimes be transcendent.” Mr. Hansard and Ms. Irglova won an Oscar for the film’s song “Falling Slowly.” KATHRYN SHATTUCK   A version of this schedule appears in print on February 23, 2013, on Page C9 of the New York edition with the headline: What’s On Today.
