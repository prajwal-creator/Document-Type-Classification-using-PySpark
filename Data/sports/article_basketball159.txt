Germany’s chances of advancing out of Group A looked slim last month after Nowitzki pulled out, but his replacement in the lineup, Jan-Hendrik Jagla, helped engineer an upset with 22 points and 9 rebounds. “We fought for every possession and always believed we could win it,” Jagla said. “It is a big step forward for us to improve and be able to win games like this one.” Jagla, a towering blond-haired forward who is perhaps as much a Nowitzki look-alike in appearance as in talent, made a 3-pointer in the final minute to give Germany (1-1) an 82-77 lead after Serbia twice forced overtime with a barrage of long-range shots.
