The game featured eight ejections. Credit Richard W. Rodriguez/Star-Telegram, via Associated Press May 15, 2016 Manchester City’s priority on Sunday was securing fourth place in England’s Premier League to qualify for the Champions League. In Manuel Pellegrini’s last league match in charge, City tied host Swansea, 1-1, but a 19-goal difference means it cannot realistically be caught by its rival Manchester United, which is 3 points back in the standings with a game to play. At United’s stadium, Old Trafford, the police dismantled a fake bomb on what was supposed to be the final day of the league’s season. The threat forced the cancellation of United’s game, against Bournemouth, before it began. The game was rescheduled for Tuesday night in Manchester. Leicester, already crowned the top-tier champion for the first time in the club’s 132-year history, completed its season with a 1-1 draw at Chelsea. BASEBALL Feud Boils Over in Texas A feud simmering since Jose Bautista’s bat flip in an American League division series last year boiled over into a wild brawl in the final game of the season between Toronto and Texas, a 7-6 victory for the host Rangers. Bautista, of Toronto, and Texas second baseman Rougned Odor got into a fistfight behind the bag after a hard slide by Bautista in the eighth inning. Players from both teams rushed the field as Odor landed the first punch to Bautista’s face. “I was pretty surprised,” Bautista said. “I mean, obviously, that’s the only reason that he got me, and he got me pretty good, so I have to give him that. It takes a little bit bigger man to knock me down.” Odor was not available for comment after the game. Umpires needed about 10 minutes to restore order, and Blue Jays reliever Jesse Chavez hit Prince Fielder with the next pitch when the game resumed. He was ejected, with both teams having been warned when Bautista was hit by a pitch from Matt Bush. Toronto Manager John Gibbons accounted for one of eight ejections from the game, after an argument in the third inning, but he was back on the field during the brawl. The first-base coach Tim Leiper was tossed in a separate argument in the third, and the bench coach DeMarlo Hale, filling in for Gibbons, was ejected when Chavez (0-1) hit Fielder. Ian Desmond hit a three-run homer in the seventh to give Bush, a 30-year-old rookie, his first major league win two days after he made his major league debut. Athletic hits three homers Danny Valencia hit three home runs, including a two-run shot in the ninth inning, as visiting Oakland edged the Tampa Bay Rays, 7-6. AUTO RACING Kenseth Earns a Narrow Victory at Dover Matt Kenseth held off Kyle Larson in a thrilling run down the stretch to win the crash-filled AAA 400 at Dover International Speedway in Delaware. Kenseth raced to his first Sprint Cup victory of the season and denied Larson his first career win. Kenseth and Larson battled for parts of the final five laps, and Kenseth, the 2003 Nascar champion, picked all the right lines and pulled away at the end. Chase Elliott finished third, the top finish of his rookie season. Larson matched his career-best finish. Teenager wins in Spain Max Verstappen of Red Bull became Formula One’s youngest race winner at age 18 with a victory at the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona. The Mercedes teammates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, the favorites, had crashed into each other on the first lap. Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari was second, and his teammate Sebastian Vettel third. BOXING Russian’s Failed Test Derails Title Bout The title defense of the heavyweight Deontay Wilder against the Russian challenger Alexander Povetkin was postponed by the World Boxing Council after Povetkin failed a drug test. Wilder’s promoter said the fight could be canceled altogether. The W.B.C. said the fight, which had been set for May 21 in Moscow, was off, pending an investigation, with no backup date. Povetkin’s promoter said the substance found in the test, in April, was meldonium. Wilder, a 36-0 American, was to make his fourth defense of the belt he won against Bermane Stiverne in January 2015. For Povetkin (30-1), it was to be his first world title challenge since losing a unanimous decision to Wladimir Klitschko in 2013. HOCKEY Germany Deals United States a Blow Germany beat the United States, 3-2, on a last-minute goal by Korbinian Holzer at the Ice Hockey World Championship in St. Petersburg, Russia, putting the Americans’ qualification for the quarterfinals in doubt. The defeat, the United States’ third in six games, left the team in fourth in Group B, one place behind Germany, with one game remaining against fifth-place Slovakia. The top four advance to the quarterfinals. Germany took the lead on a power-play goal by Patrick Hager in the first period before Jake McCabe tied the game for the Americans. Germany responded quickly with a goal by Christian Ehrhoff. A power-play goal by Auston Matthews early in the second period tied the score, 2-2, but Holzer scored with 30 seconds remaining in the third. In Moscow, Denmark beat the Czech Republic, 2-1, in a shootout. CYCLING Italian Keeps Overall Lead at Giro d’Italia The Italian Gianluca Brambilla retained the overall lead in the Giro d’Italia through the ninth stage as the Slovenian Primoz Roglic won a rainy individual time trial for his first Grand Tour stage victory. Roglic, who was beaten by 0.01 of a second in the opening time trial, had the advantage of drier roads before the rain began to fall on the hilly 25-mile route from Radda to Greve in Italy, the heart of the Tuscan red-wine-making region. Roglic finished in 51 minutes 45 seconds to claim a stage win in his first Grand Tour since switching from ski jumping to cycling. Sagan wins stage in California The world champion Peter Sagan of Slovakia unleashed his powerful sprint at the last possible moment, overcoming Wouter Wippert and Dylan Groenewegen, to win the opening stage of the Tour of California in San Diego. PRO BASKETBALL Knicks’ Jackson Said to Meet With Vogel Phil Jackson, the president of the Knicks, met with Frank Vogel recently to discuss the team’s coaching vacancy, according to a person briefed on their discussion. Vogel was fired as the coach of the Indiana Pacers this month after the team lost its first-round playoff series against the Toronto Raptors. In six seasons with the Pacers, Vogel had a 250-181 record and led the team to the playoffs five times, including two appearances in the Eastern Conference finals. But Vogel’s contract was not renewed by Larry Bird, the team president. Bird told reporters that he was troubled by the Pacers’ lack of scoring under Vogel. Kurt Rambis, who took over as the Knicks’ interim coach after Jackson fired Derek Fisher in February, is still believed to be the front-runner for the job. Jackson has also met with David Blatt, the former coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Jackson’s meeting with Vogel was first reported by The Daily News. SCOTT CACCIOLA OLYMPICS A Plea for Russia’s Track and Field Team Russia, facing deepening scrutiny over accusations that it orchestrated a doping campaign during the Sochi Olympics in 2014, made a public plea for its track and field athletes to be allowed to compete in this summer’s Games. Writing in The Sunday Times , a British newspaper, the Russian sports minister said Russian officials, coaches and athletes made “serious mistakes,” but he stopped short of specifying them or admitting to any state role. “We are very sorry that athletes who tried to deceive us, and the world, were not caught sooner,” wrote the sports minister, Vitaly Mutko. “We are very sorry because Russia is committed to upholding the highest standards in sport and is opposed to anything that threatens the Olympic values.” But he added: “It cannot be right that clean athletes should suffer for the behavior of others. In no other walk of life would this happen.” The accusations of an elaborate drug operation at the 2014 Winter Olympics, published last week in The New York Times , have led to growing calls to bar Russia and its powerhouse track and field team from the Rio Games, which are set to open in August.
