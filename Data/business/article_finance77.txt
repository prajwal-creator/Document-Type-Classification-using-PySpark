Sloan Foundation Project, is directed by Linsay Firman, who also developed Ms. Ziegler’s earlier “Photograph 51.” Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, 212-239-6200, keencompany.org. (Soloski) ‘Bright Star’ (in previews; opens on March 24) Spring is a month or two away, but the bluegrass is already growing on Broadway.

Shively star as an editor and a soldier with a startling connection. Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, 212-239-6200, brightstarmusical.com. (Soloski) ‘The Crucible’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on March 31) Come dancing in the forest with the men and women of Puritan Salem in the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller’s tragedy. Did the director Ivo van Hove (“Lazarus”) deal with the Devil to assemble such a remarkable colonial cast? It includes Ben Whishaw, Sophie Okonedo, Ciaran Hinds and Saoirse Ronan. Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, 800-745-3000, thecrucibleonbroadway.com. (Soloski) ‘Disaster!’ (in previews; opens on March 8) It’s opening night at New York City’s first-ever floating casino and discothèque. What could go wrong? Everything. This jukebox musical, a loopy tribute to 1970s disaster flicks, has an imperiled cast that includes Roger Bart, Adam Pascal, Kerry Butler, Faith Prince and Seth Rudetsky, who wrote the book with Jack Plotnick. Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, 877-250-2929, disastermusical.com. (Soloski) ‘Dry Powder’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on March 22) Claire Danes and John Krasinski play rival managing directors at a private equity firm embroiled in an increasingly public battle in this new play by Sarah Burgess, produced by the Public Theater. The director Thomas Kail (“Hamilton”) oversees this high-stakes, high-finance comedy drama, which co-stars Hank Azaria. 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, publictheater.org. (Soloski) ‘Eclipsed’ (in previews; opens on March 6) Danai Gurira’s drama about female captives in the Liberian civil war, directed by Liesl Tommy, moves to Broadway with its Public Theater cast, including Lupita Nyong’o, intact. Writing in The New York Times, Charles Isherwood described it as a “shattering drama about women’s suffering during the Liberian civil wars” and less a star vehicle than an “ensemble piece, with terrific roles for five women.” Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, eclipsedbroadway.com. (Soloski) ‘The Effect’ (previews start on Wednesday; opens on March 16) Big pharma and little lives intersect in a recent play from Lucy Prebble (“Enron.”) During a drug trial for a new antidepressant, a psychiatrist, a manager and two volunteers test out what might be a “Viagra for the heart.” But are we more than the sum of our brain chemicals? The director David Cromer investigates. Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, 212-868-4444, barrowstreettheatre.com. (Soloski) ‘Familiar’ (in previews; opens on Thursday) Even as the actress Danai Gurira wastes zombies on “The Walking Dead,” she somehow finds time and energy for a soaring playwriting career. With her “Eclipsed” soon to appear on Broadway, Ms. Gurira is also busy a few blocks away, with this new play about cross-cultural conflict at a Minnesota wedding. The director Rebecca Taichman officiates. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, 212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org. (Soloski) ‘Hold on to Me Darling’ (in previews; opens on March 14) Timothy Olyphant, who starred in the FX series “Justified,” has exchanged his marshal’s badge for an acoustic guitar in Kenneth Lonergan’s new play for the Atlantic Theater Company. In Neil Pepe’s production, co-starring Adelaide Clemens, Mr. Olyphant plays Strings McCrane, a country-and-western legend who is trying to escape his twanging fame. Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, 866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Soloski) ‘Ironbound’ (previews start on Thursday; opens on March 16) A cleaning woman with a messy life is the star of Martyna Majok’s play, co-produced by Rattlestick Playwrights Theater and Women’s Project Theater. Marin Ireland stars as an immigrant domestic worker, trying to make a decent life for herself and her son. Josiah Bania, Shiloh Fernandez and Morgan Spector also appear in Daniella Topol’s production. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, 866-811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Soloski) ‘Red Speedo’ (in previews; opens on Thursday) After working several small miracles with “The Christians” in the fall, Lucas Hnath reappears at New York Theater Workshop with this drama of sports doping. As the Olympic trials approach, a promising swimmer is suspected of using performance-enhancing drugs. Lileana Blain-Cruz directs a team with Alex Breaux, Peter Jay Fernandez, Lucas Caleb Rooney and Zoë Winters. 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, 212-460-5475, nytw.org. (Soloski) ‘Rimbaud in New York’ (performances start on Tuesday) The drunken boat of the poet Arthur Rimbaud alights at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the latest work by the Civilians. This documentary troupe explores both Rimbaud’s influence on generations of New York artists and the poems themselves, as translated by John Ashbery. The production includes songs by Adam Cochran, Michael Friedman, Rebecca Hart, Joseph Keckler, Matthew Dean Marsh and Grace McLean. Fishman Space at BAM Fisher, 321 Ashland Place, at Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Soloski) ‘The Robber Bridegroom’ (in previews; opens on March 13) A Robin Hood story with a “country and Southern” score, Alfred Uhry and Robert Waldman’s Mississippi-set musical steals into the Roundabout, directed by Alex Timbers. Steven Pasquale plays an unusually handsome outlaw and Ahna O’Reilly is his upstanding love interest, with Evan Harrington and Andrew Durand as rival bandits. Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Soloski) ‘The Royale’ (in previews; opens on March 7) The playwright Marco Ramirez and the director Rachel Chavkin step into the ring with this new play loosely based on the life of Jack Johnson, the first African-American to become the world heavyweight boxing champion. Khris Davis, a newcomer to New York stages, and Montego Glover (“Memphis”) star. Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, 212-239-6200, lct.org. (Soloski) ‘She Loves Me’ (in previews; opens on March 17) Enjoy the sweet smell of a Broadway revival of Joe Masteroff, Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock’s musical about love among employees at a perfumery, directed by Scott Ellis. In Roundabout Theater Company’s production, Laura Benanti and Zachary Levi star as two fragrance-crossed lovers, alongside Jane Krakowski, Gavin Creel and Michael McGrath as their co-workers. Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, 212-239-6200, roundabouttheatre.org. (Soloski) ‘Southern Comfort’ (in previews; opens on March 8) Kate Davis’s 2001 documentary about a transgender man finding love while ovarian cancer consumes him has been reimagined as a high-proof musical. Thomas Caruso directs the terminal romance, with music by Julianne Wick Davis and book and lyrics by Dan Collins. Jeff McCarthy and Annette O’Toole play the rural Georgia twosome. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, 212-967-7555, publictheater.org. (Soloski) ‘The Way West’ (in previews; opens on March 16) Mona Mansour, whose “Urge for Going” was seen at the Public Lab in 2011, returns with a new play about financial mismanagement on an intimate scale. Mimi O’Donnell, artistic director of Labyrinth Theater Company, directs a comedy starring Deirdre O’Connell as a bankrupt mother who still can’t balance a budget. Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, 212-513-1080, labtheater.org. (Soloski) ‘The Wildness’ (in previews;; opens on Monday) The indie pop aces Sky-Pony canter into Ars Nova with this new music-theater piece, presented in collaboration with the Play Company. Details are scant on this “rock fairy tale,” but Sky-Pony, led by the singer Lauren Worsham and the composer Kyle Jarrow, promises a “world of prophecies and forbidden temptations.” Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, 212-352-3101, arsnovanyc.com. (Soloski) Broadway ★ ‘An American in Paris’ The ballet luminary Christopher Wheeldon makes a triumphant debut as a Broadway director with this rhapsodic stage adaptation of a classic musical with a heavenly Gershwin score. The ballet dancers Robert Fairchild and Leanne Cope, as the semi-star-crossed lovers, are radiant, and Max von Essen sings like a dream as an heir who aspires to a nightclub career. Pure joy (2:30). The Palace Theater. 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, ticketmaster.com, 877-250-2929. (Charles Isherwood) ★ ‘The Color Purple’ A makeover made in heaven. The director John Doyle has slimmed down and toned up a show that seemed leaden and garish in its original Broadway incarnation. This musical version of Alice Walker’s celebrated novel about black women finding their voices — which features Jennifer Hudson and, in a star-making performance, Cynthia Erivo — is a triumph of elemental, emotional storytelling (2:35). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, colorpurple.com. (Ben Brantley) ★ ‘Fiddler on the Roof’ This timely new production of the much-loved and much-revived 1964 musical comedy honors the show’s ebullience of spirit, as embodied in the Jewish milkman Tevye (an assured and affecting Danny Burstein), living in a Russian shtetl in the early 20th century. But as directed by Bartlett Sher with his customary sensitivity (“The King and I,” “South Pacific”), this multihued staging moves to a heart-stopping conclusion. It’s just a musical, no? Yes, but what a musical (2:35)! Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, 212-239-6200, fiddlermusical.com. (Isherwood) ‘Finding Neverland’ This musical adaptation of the 2004 biopic about J. M. Barrie, the creator of “Peter Pan,” heightens the film’s tidy psychologizing and life-affirming messages by thickening their syrup and corn quotients. The show brings to mind those supersize sodas sold in movie theaters. It’s mostly empty calories. Diane Paulus directs a cast led by Tony Yazbeck (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, 877-250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Fun Home’ This extraordinary musical memory play about a girl and her father, adapted by Jeanine Tesori (music) and Lisa Kron (book and lyrics) from Alison Bechdel’s graphic novel, occupies that mysterious place where we all grew up — the shifting landscape governed by those contradictory creatures, our parents. Sam Gold directs a nigh-flawless cast in a show that brings fresh oxygen to Broadway (1:40). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, funhomebroadway.com, 212-239-6200. (Brantley) ★ ‘Hamilton’ Yes, it really is that good. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s rap-driven portrait of the rise and fall of Alexander Hamilton, directed by Thomas Kail, makes us feel the unstoppable, urgent rhythm of a nation being born. A show that changes the language of the American musical, while offering resounding evidence that this beleaguered genre is not only surviving but thriving (2:45). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, 877-250-2929, hamiltonbroadway.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘The Humans’ Stephen Karam’s extraordinary comedy-drama — the finest of the season — has transferred to Broadway with its prized virtues intact: a superlative cast; direction from Joe Mantello that deftly navigates its shifts in tone; and, of course, Mr. Karam’s delicate but trenchant writing, depicting with great humor and empathy a middle-class family on the edge of the abyss (1:35). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) ★ ‘The King and I’ Bartlett Sher’s resplendent revival of this Rodgers and Hammerstein classic, set in the royal court of 19th-century Siam, is both panoramic and personal, balancing epic sweep with intimate sensibility, lavish set pieces with exquisitely sung soliloquies. Kelli O’Hara’s Anna Leonowens is something wonderful indeed (2:50). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, 212-239-6200, lct.org. (Brantley) ★ ‘Noises Off’ Michael Frayn’s dazzling, dizzying farce within a farce returns to Broadway for the third time in a superbly acted production directed by Jeremy Herrin (“Wolf Hall”). Andrea Martin and Megan Hilty give the most lushly funny performances, but there’s not a weak link in the cast, which also includes Campbell Scott, Daniel Davis and Tracee Chimo (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood) ‘On Your Feet!’ This latest jukebox musical to plug in to Broadway’s power strip tells the story of Gloria and Emilio Estefan’s rise to pop-chart success with crowd-pleasing flair and plenty of itchy-feet-making dance music. The vibrant Ana Villafañe and Josh Segarra star as the Cuban-born Estefans (2:20). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, 877-250-2929, onyourfeetmusical.com. (Isherwood) ‘Our Mother’s Brief Affair’ The wonderful Linda Lavin again demonstrates that there’s more than one way to skin a stereotype — to wit, the belittling Jewish mom — in the title role of Richard Greenberg’s untethered memory play about unmoored lives. Directed by Lynne Meadow, this generally diffuse portrait of familial mysteries has moments of inspired insight and eloquence, but never acquires much urgency (2:00). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, 212-239-6200, manhattantheatreclub.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘School of Rock: The Musical’ Andrew Lloyd Webber’s friskiest show in decades. Based on the 2003 movie, this story of a rock ’n’ roll nerd (played by Alex Brightman, a bouncing Super Ball of energy) who teaches a class of regimented fifth-graders (a fabulous band of preadolescents) to “stick it to the man” is as amiably easygoing as it is loud (2:20). Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, schoolofrockthemusical.com, 212-239-6200. (Brantley) ‘Something Rotten!’ This rambunctious show, which weds the Elizabethan theater and the brassy Broadway musical, dances dangerously on the line between tireless and tedious. But the large cast, which includes Brian D’Arcy James and Christian Borle, remains as wired as Adderall-popping sophomores during exam week. Casey Nicholaw directed this exhausting frolic from Wayne and Karey Kirkpatrick, and John O’Farrell (2:20). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, 212-239-6200, rottenbroadway.com. (Brantley) Off Broadway ★ ‘Angel Reapers’ Martha Clarke and Alfred Uhry’s vivid and luminous Shaker dance-theater piece begins with joy, but torment most marks the lives of its little band of worshipers. It’s the twinning of the two, euphoria and anguish, that makes this beautifully designed show quietly glorious (1:10). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Laura Collins-Hughes) ‘Bayside! The Musical’ Attending this bawdy, ridiculous, unauthorized parody of the harebrained sitcom “Saved by the Bell” is a bit like going to a midnight screening of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” given the many inside jokes and synchronized audience responses. Audience members know the material so well because half the humor comes from merely reproducing every ludicrous plot twist and trope from the TV show (including Zack’s giant cellphone, Becky the Duck and other allusions that will be familiar to longtime fans). The other half of the humor is just good old-fashioned raunch, usually playing up the horrifying ways to reinterpret a squeaky-clean children’s show (2:00). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, 212-388-0388, baysidethemusical.com. (Catherine Rampell) ★ ‘The Body of an American’ Dan O’Brien’s lyrical, untidy and ultimately poignant play, produced by Primary Stages and directed by Jo Bonney, is a ghost story and a true story. Two haunted men, the war photographer Paul Watson (Michael Cumpsty) and Mr. O’Brien himself (Michael Crane), strike up a tentative friendship. The script, poetic and fragmentary, explores what it means to witness, to confess, to make art from suffering (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, 866-811-4111, primarystages.org. (Soloski) ‘Broadway & the Bard’ Len Cariou’s odd but engaging solo show combines classic Shakespearean monologues (and one sonnet) and Broadway show tunes. The music director Mark Janas provides nimble support at the piano (1:20). The Lion Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) ‘The Burial at Thebes’ While there’s not much to look at in this adaptation of “Antigone,” there’s a lot to listen to in the wonderful adaptation by the poet Seamus Heaney (1:20). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, 212-727-2737, irishrep.org. (Ken Jaworowski) ‘Buried Child’ The New Group’s revival of Sam Shepard’s 1978 drama of homecoming, starring a wickedly good Ed Harris as a man drifting merrily into death, may be performed in a lower key than the usual interpretations of this American Gothic masterwork. But Scott Elliott’s lucid production is absorbing enough to remind us why Mr. Shepard’s haunted mansion is always worth revisiting (1:45). Alice Griffin Jewel Box Theater, Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-279-4200, thenewgroup.org. (Brantley) ‘Daddy Long Legs’ This sweet, beautifully sung and only occasionally unsettling musical adaptation of Jean Webster’s 1912 novel is predicated on the lengthy correspondence between a pert orphan and her anonymous benefactor. Even if the relationship between the adorable Jerusha and the debonair Jervis reads as at least a little creepy, their voices twine charmingly (2:15). Davenport Theater, 354 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, daddylonglegsmusical.com. (Soloski) ★ ‘Drunk Shakespeare’ Probably you’ve seen streamlined, amped-up productions of Shakespeare before, but the gimmick here is that as the performance of “Macbeth” begins, one of the actors downs a mind-fogging number of shots. What follows is a wild mashup of Shakespeare and pop-culture references that seems chaotically improvised but takes a deceptive amount of skill to execute. The audience sits right up against the action and sometimes gets drawn into it (1:30). The Lounge, Roy Arias Stages, 300 West 43rd Street, fourth floor, drunkshakespeare.com. (Neil Genzlinger) ‘Full House! The Musical!’ This frenetic, ribald and exhausting satire from the creators of “Bayside! The Musical!” barely stops for breath. Only Marshall Louise freezes time with her delicious sendup of the grown Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Her impersonation may be one-note, but it is something to treasure (2:00). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, 212-388-0388, fullhousethemusical.com. (Andy Webster) ‘Her Requiem’ A precocious gift for musical composition proves to be as much a curse as a blessing in Greg Pierce’s thoughtful drama, featuring Mare Winningham and Peter Friedman giving finely wrought performances as the parents of the 17-year-old prodigy (1:30). Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, 212-239-6200, lct3.org. (Isherwood) ‘The Last Class: A Jazzercize Play” Glistening with sweat, Megan Hill’s comedy is essentially a real-time Jazzercise class with a wacky plot fused to it, as a willfully chipper exercise instructor (Ms. Hill) fights to save her career. But the show is also a kind of musical, whose technical demands overwhelm this production (55 minutes). TheaterLab, 357 West 36th Street, theaterlabnyc.com. (Collins-Hughes) ★ ‘Nice Fish’ Mark Rylance wrote, with the prose poet Louis Jenkins, this odd charmer of a play, drawing on Mr. Jenkins’s oeuvre. Mr. Rylance and Jim Lichtscheidl lead a flawless cast as two old buddies trading philosophical reflections on an ice-fishing excursion (1:35). St. Ann’s Warehouse, 45 Water Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, 866-811-4111, stannswarehouse.org. (Isherwood) ★ ‘Old Hats’ David Shiner and Bill Irwin return to New York with this show, first seen in 2013, and their almost wordless clowning around is as enjoyable as ever. But the production has a somewhat darker tinge because, this time, the music is being provided by Shaina Taub (replacing Nellie McKay). Her original songs give the proceedings a Kit Kat Club aura, simultaneously funny, sad and a little foreboding (2:00). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Genzlinger) ★ ‘Please Continue’ Frank Basloe’s fictionalized drama about the people involved with Stanley Milgram’s 1960s obedience experiments at Yale is relentlessly thought-provoking and absolutely gripping. The story explores the question of how far people will go when “just obeying orders,” the morality of testing and a related case of victimization (1:20). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, 212-247-4982, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Anita Gates) ‘Prodigal Son’ John Patrick Shanley (“Doubt,” “Moonstruck”) revisits the hell of being 15 in this hymn to the impossible, combustible and brilliant young thing he once was. Directed by Mr. Shanley, and featuring the charismatic Timothee Chalamet his alter-ego, it’s a portrait of the playwright as a problem prep school student, and it’s filled with the sort of anguished self-centeredness you associate with raw adolescent egos (1:35). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Brantley) ‘Ruthless!’ This spiked Shirley Temple of a show, which first opened in 1992 and now returns with less fizz, follows the adventures of Tina Denmark (Tori Murray), a stage-struck prepubescent with occasional homicidal tendencies. But what must have once seemed wildly satirical could practically pass for documentary (1:35). St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, ruthlessthemusical.com. (Soloski) ★ ‘Sense & Sensibility’ Bedlam’s enchanting romp of a comedy, adapted by Kate Hamill from Jane Austen’s novel, transforms genteel gossip into a dynamic, palpable force that shapes collective societies, individual destinies and, as it turns out, irresistible theater. Eric Tucker directs a wondrously mutable cast in a production replete with buoyant spirits and inventive do-it-yourself stagecraft (2:30). The Gym at Judson, 243 Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, 866-811-4111, bedlam.org. (Brantley) ‘Shear Madness’ This astonishingly durable interactive murder mystery has been running in Boston since Jimmy Carter was in the White House, and some of the jokes in the late-arriving New York incarnation definitely show their years. But the tone of this improv-heavy play depends hugely on the performers. They lend an inclusive spirit of fun to the proceedings, set in a Manhattan hair salon where the audience determines which character is the most likely suspect (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, 212-239-6200, shearmadness.com. (Collins-Hughes) ‘Smart People’ Lydia R. Diamond’s plays depicts the relationships among four racially diverse people living near or working at Harvard. Although it tackles provocative issues of race, class and identity, the play often feels more like a series of brief lectures or debates than a fully realized drama (2:15). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, 212-246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood) ‘Smokefall’ Noah Haidle’s enigmatic drama follows the unhappy lives of several generations of a family in Grand Rapids, Mich. While the production, directed by Anne Kauffman, features a sterling cast, including Zachary Quinto, Mr. Haidle’s meditation on man’s birthright — unhappiness — is overly clotted with quirks (1:35). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, 866-811-4111, mcctheater.org. (Isherwood) ★ ‘Thank God for Jokes’ Mike Birbiglia, who had success in 2008 with “Sleepwalk With Me,” is back with another monologue, and it’s spectacular. His subject is humor — the structure and purpose of a joke, the rules for when and where to tell one — but this is no lecture. His core anecdote involves an infamous joke he told while hosting an awards ceremony, but it’s the frequent, elaborate detours that make this show such a delight. By the end, you realize that somehow some thoughtful points have been slipped in while you were laughing nonstop for almost an hour and a half (1:23). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, thankgodforjokes.com. (Genzlinger) ‘Trip of Love’ This bloated concoction takes a seemingly random collection of Top 40 hits from the 1960s and turns them into dance numbers, with a sparse, clichéd girl-meets-boy story woven in. Ridiculous stuff, but the big-budget sets are sometimes fun (1:50). Stage 42, 422 West 42nd Street,212-239-6200, tripoflove.com. (Genzlinger) ‘The Woodsman’ James Ortiz’s largely wordless play with music uses puppets and actors, a chorus and a lone violin to reimagine the corner of Oz where the Tin Man came to be. The production is visually and aurally enchanting, but its creators still need to find the key to the story’s heart (1:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, thewoodsmanplay.com. (Collins-Hughes) Off Off Broadway ★ ‘The Grand Paradise’ The immersive theater troupe Third Rail (“Then She Fell”) has created a lush, 1970s-style tropical resort for virtual hedonists. An experience that allows you to have and remember a wild vacation simultaneously, with both romantic promise and retrospective regret. Be prepared to be touched a lot, and to hear New Age gobbledygook about love and death (2:00). 383 Troutman Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 718-374-5196, thegrandparadise.com. (Brantley) ‘Puffs, Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years at a Certain School of Magic and Magic’ Aimed at grown-up Potterphiliacs, Matt Cox’s teasingly affectionate, fast-paced parody of the Hogwarts universe embraces, with varying success, the nerds whom the sorting hat assigns to the house called Puff. The fine ensemble includes the sublimely hilarious Madeleine Bundy as Harry (1:20). The Peoples Improv Theater, 123 East 24th Street, thepit-nyc.com. (Collins-Hughes) Long-Running Shows ‘Aladdin’ The Disney movie refashioned for the stage, with shtick, sparkles and silliness cutting the syrup (2:20).

Last Chance ‘Burning’ (closes on Sunday) Ginger Lazarus’s modern-day take on “Cyrano,” in which the protagonist is a lesbian army veteran with a blog, is clever, but the subplot about violence against women in the military stands out like a sore thumb. Playing in repertory with “Cyrano de Bergerac” (2:10). Theater at St. Clement’s, 423 West 46th Street, 866-811-4111, resonanceensemble.org. (Gates) ‘The Cherry Orchard’ (closes on Saturday) In Maly Drama Theater’s production of Anton Chekhov’s final play, adapted and directed by Lev Dodin, nothing happens and everything happens, in ways both frustrating and wonderfully exciting. The first half is a long and desultory sit, but in the second, the orchard blossoms exquisitely, speaking not only to the time of its creation, but also to contemporary Russia and more universally, too. (In Russian with English supertitles.) (3:00). BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, near Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Soloski) ‘Drunken With What’ (closes on Sunday) Target Margin Theater pours out an esoteric tribute to Eugene O’Neill’s “Mourning Becomes Electra” as our actors enact the terrible fate of the Mannon clan. A deconstructionist approach highlights the range of style and inspiration within the play itself, sometimes speaking to its internal tensions. But the intellectual playfulness pretty well negates tragedy (1:40). Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, 866-811-4111, targetmargin.org. (Soloski) ‘The Good Girl’ (closes on Sunday) A sexbot learns to cry in Emilie Collyer’s feminist sci-fi comedy, set in a postapocalyptic dystopia where sex between humans seems to have been banned, at least for the masses. The characters are desperate for a little human touch, and so is this chilly, too brisk production (50 minutes). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Collins-Hughes) ‘I and You’ (closes on Sunday) Lauren Gunderson’s perky, two-character play about adolescent sorrows and cosmic mysteries, directed by Sean Daniels, brings to mind a conventional young adult novel. It also features an ingenious, jolting conclusion that may not make up for earlier irritations for anyone over 12. Kayla Ferguson and Reggie D. White perform with equal measures of angst and impishness (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Brantley) ‘The White Stag Quadrilogy’ (closes on Saturday) This sparely staged but unrelentingly verbose comedy — about a vainglorious Hollywood director and his sycophants — aims to send up Southern California in the 1970s (and a bit of the 1980s), but succeeds largely in skewering itself (1:30). Dixon Place, 161A Chrystie Street, between Rivington and Delancey Streets, Lower East Side, 866-811-4111, dixonplace.org.
