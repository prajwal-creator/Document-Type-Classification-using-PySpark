The flu strain A(H3N2), considered the most virulent of the three and the same type that caused pandemics in the 1950's and 1960's, is causing widespread illness throughout Alaska. Absentee rates of 20 percent were reported in some school systems, where outbreaks of influenza have been occurring for three weeks. Dr. Karl Kappus of the disease centers' influenza surveillance branch said the Alaskan flu outbreaks were affecting ''all the major communities in the state,'' adding, ''Fairbanks, Juneau and Anchorage are very much affected and other areas could be as well.'' Isolated in 2 Other States He said the epidemic there began in children of school age but that health officials were now reporting large numbers of flu cases in adults.

It has been identified this fall in at least two states, Texas and New York.

Before it ran its course in late February, influenza and pneumonia took the lives of several thousand people, mostly the elderly, for the highest flu fatality toll in five years.

Case of Russian Flu In Hawaii, a single case of A(H1N1) flu virus, the so-called Russian flu, which made a reappearance in this country in the 1970's after an absence of more than 20 years, was reported. ''The reports above document the current circulation in the United States of the three major types of influenza virus that have caused outbreaks in recent seasons,'' the centers said. The centers urged physicians and other health care personnel to continue efforts to vaccinate people in high-risk groups and to continue ''contingency planning for deploying the available antiviral agent, amantadine, in the event that outbreaks of Type-A influenza occur among their high-risk patients.'' Amantadine is a drug that the centers says is 70 to 90 percent effective in preventing illness caused by the A-type flu viruses.    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
