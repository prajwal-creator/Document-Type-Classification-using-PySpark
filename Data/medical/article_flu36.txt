Perhaps because of the attention the media paid to the disease initially, and the lack of immediately dire developments, we are now enjoying a perceived respite. But the disease is more prevalent than ever before, and we still lack full understanding of it. I have just returned from looking for novel strains of the virus in birds on remote islands of the South Atlantic. The lack of an “explosive outbreak” to date should not be interpreted to indicate that the likelihood of such an event has decreased. Continued monitoring of the poultry trade, a more comprehensive look at illicit movements of poultry and poultry products, and surveillance of wild birds and wildlife in trade continue to be needed if we are to protect ourselves from outbreaks or mitigate their effects.
