At the 60th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday in New York , a number of artists, producers and executives opted to accent their red carpet looks with a white rose after a last-minute push by behind-the-scenes music-industry professionals to come up with a gesture of unity for this #MeToo moment. Taking a page from the Time’s Up initiative against harassment and workplace inequality, which had its black-dress debut earlier this month at the Golden Globes, a separate, more do-it-yourself organization called Voices in Entertainment began an email campaign on Wednesday to spread the word about the accessory of choice. The white rose, the group said, “has historically stood for hope, peace, sympathy, and resistance.” In a message sent to supporters and the news media on Sunday ahead of the Grammys, Voices in Entertainment said it was fighting for “equal representation in the workplace, for leadership that reflects the diversity of our society, workplaces free of sexual harassment and a heightened awareness of accountability that our sisters started on January 1st and continued through the Golden Globes and onward.” The letter of support — initiated by a dozen female executives who worried nothing else was being done for what is known as music’s biggest night — was signed by hundreds of rank-and-file members of the music world, along with a ragtag collection of artists and celebrities including the Grammys host James Corden, Fat Joe, Zayn Malik, Fergie, Kelly Clarkson and Lisa Loeb.

At the preshow event, the singer Reba McEntire invoked the golden rule, adding, “Let’s just treat people kindly.” [ Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder. ] On the red carpet, artists wearing a white rose included Lady Gaga, Ms. Clarkson, Khalid, Sam Smith, the Chainsmokers and more, though others opted not to adorn their outfits. ( TMZ reported on Friday that New York florists had been flooded with requests and were even turning some people away; Voices in Entertainment said on Saturday that it had received a mass rose donation and would be handing out flowers at the Hotel Pennsylvania on Sunday.) The E! red carpet correspondent Giuliana Rancic had the flower affixed to her microphone, while others, like SZA, Cardi B and Sarah Silverman, held their flower in hand or even in mouth. Cardi B, who was nominated in two rap categories, was more characteristically pointed when addressing sexism in the music industry. “‘I can get you on a billboard,’” she said, mimicking a male executive before adding: “‘Whoops, there’s my penis.’” Related Coverage Bruno Mars Sweeps Top Prizes at the 2018 Grammy Awards Jan. 28, 2018 Image Grammy 2018 Winners: Full List Jan. 28, 2018 Image Janelle Monáe Brings a ‘Time’s Up’ Message to the Grammy Awards Jan. 28, 2018 Image Show All Advertisement Site Index Go to Home Page » news home page world U.S. politics politics New York business tech science sports obituaries today's paper corrections corrections opinion today's opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials editorials contributing writers op-ed Contributors letters letters sunday review sunday review taking note video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music television theater video: arts living automobiles automobiles crossword food food education fashion & style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings listings & more tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account news home page world U.S. politics politics New York business tech science sports obituaries today's paper corrections corrections opinion today's opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials editorials contributing writers op-ed Contributors letters letters sunday review sunday review taking note video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music television theater video: arts living automobiles automobiles crossword food food education fashion & style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings more tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account Subscribe home delivery digital subscriptions Crossword email newsletters corporate subscriptions education rate mobile applications replica edition Site Information Navigation © 2018  The New York Times Company Contact Us Work with us Advertise Your Ad Choices Privacy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Help Help Subscriptions Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
