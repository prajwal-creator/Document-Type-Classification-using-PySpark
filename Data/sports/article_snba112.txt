''Imagine, some parents are actually hiring tutors to help their children prepare for the achievement tests.'' My husband, ever the realist in the family, and whose sense of the absurd seldom agrees with mine, was interested. What's more, he wanted to know where we could hire a tutor for our son. After all, he argued, why should he have to compete against students who had received extra help when we could provide him with that help too? From a purely practical standpoint I had to admit he was right, but being the sort who doesn't easily accept the realities of life, who as a child could be heard whining ''but it's not fair'' long after the other children had resigned themselves, it was difficult for me to agree. My husband, however, was insistent and finally played his trump. How could I be unfair to my own son? The school district we reside in is a fine one. Its excellence is one of the reasons we've chosen to live here. Residents are typical of those in many upper middle-class suburban communities. They place high value on quality education and aspire to send their children to the best colleges.

In the hope of getting high college board scores, tutors are hired or the student is enrolled in a prep course, especially designed for that purpose, and that can cost upward of $300. High school is no longer an entity in itself but a vehicle for entrance into college. Courses are selected not because of interest in the subject matter, but because (a) the college of one's choice requires it, (b) it's easy, a sure A, or (c) it's unusual but academically credible and will look good on the transcript. After-school activities and even athletics are chosen the same way. When I asked a friend of my son's why he was, to the dismay of both coaches, trying to run track at the same time he was playing hockey, he said his mother thought it would look impressive on his record. Another boy confided with a sigh that he would be glad when junior year was over and he could stop playing the cello. Puzzled, I inquired, ''But why stop now?'' Senior year didn't count, he informed me. His orchestra participation would still appear on his record, and that was what really mattered. Rest assured that for these go-getters there is no sitting back. Even spare time is taken into account. Work experience always looks good on a college application, and so does volunteer work. No matter that the job obtained or the work volunteered for doesn't really interest the applicant.

Those vying for admission to the most competitive schools are ever on the lookout for the job or activity that is unique, something that will make them stand out among the other high achievers. While in many cases the students themselves are highly motivated, parental pressure plays no small role in this race. The lines become blurred, and one wonders exactly whose achievement admission to a particular school is. Indeed, many parents bask glowingly in the reflected glory of an Ivy League acceptance. Competition is a driving force that can spur us on to greater gains. It encourages us to do our best. It also has been known to induce stress and anxiety. Many adults have difficulty coping with these aspects of competition. For the adolescent, whose fragile ego is still developing and vulnerable, the results can be devastating.

Is his sense of self-worth threatened by less than spectacular scores on the college boards? Is his confidence shattered by his inability to be admitted to a prestigious college? In a school district where many regard college admission as a matter of unparalleled importance, it would not seem unlikely. Adolescence is supposedly a time for learning, experimenting and even making mistakes. It is through these processes that a human being grows into a mature, well-functioning adult.  For those obsessed with admission to a competitive college, there is no time for mistakes or risk taking. In the interest of presenting that perfect profile, they can't be permitted to fall or fail at all. What kind of human being does such pressure produce? A look at the medical profession might provide a clue. Medical schools have recently come under fire for producing physicians who, while academically and technically expert, are often found lacking in such humane qualities as patience and compassion. In the analysis of the reason for this, the rigorous course of study that doctors in training must adhere to has been questioned. Does it leave time or energy for them to develop as human beings as well? That is the issue now being discussed. In my community, talk of board scores, class rank and who is applying where dominates the conversation. Yes, there is life aside from academic achievement, but one would be hard pressed to find evidence of it. Getting that competitive edge overshadows other important values. And in my house, the scrap of paper with the tutor's number scrawled on it remains next to my telephone. Barbara Gerbasi lives in New Hyde Park.
