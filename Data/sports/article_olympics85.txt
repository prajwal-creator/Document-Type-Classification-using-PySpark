In Pottersville, it's another humid day on Manhattan's West Side as sodden shoppers exit the gray cinderblock facade of a Super Wal-Mart built over the railroad yards despite public protests over the excessive red glow of "Super" that has left the neighborhood with the eerie tint of a darkroom. In Paris, the world is strolling arm in arm with French Olympic volunteers who have sworn to refrain from le sneer or le scoff at uncouth tourists or narcissist athletes for exactly 17 days during the 2012 Summer Games. In Pottersville, a mom with a stroller is ferrying a 200-pack of Pampers she bought on Wal-Mart credit through a subway turnstile with a $6 swipe of her MetroCard, the cost of which, alas, has ballooned since the M.T.A. lost a $720 million infusion from Woody Johnson on June 6, 2005, the day the Jets' stadium deal collapsed.

Something unwanted will be built there one day, but apparently it will not be the translucent-skinned stadium with the park space and potential revenue return.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       There were some whispers of a revival, but barring an 11th-hour resuscitation, yesterday was the instant Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff's inner George Bailey was finally snuffed out by the demons of political paralysis. In a city that never blinks, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver stood in staunch resistance to the stadium's financing plan, even though it meant certain doom for New York's Olympic dream, not to mention the 2010 Super Bowl. No amount of pork promises by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg could stop the demolition of the NYC2012 bid, an Olympic proposal that seemed to contain no Plan B for Queens in the mind of Doctoroff, a showman perhaps detrimentally optimistic until the end. His despair was James L. Dolan's delight. Jimmy D. was probably grooving like a Knicks City Dancer as he happily howled at the demise of the stadium project, which would have left his play toy, Madison Square Garden, as the concert destination for retread hair bands -- or the group Kiss. New York had a shot to win the Olympic bid, too. The International Olympic Committee all but ranked Paris as its top choice for the 2012 Games in an evaluation released yesterday, but such pet status can be a jinx. Ask anyone who knows the unpredictable election history of the I.O.C. voters. Ask anyone who understands how world politics can move the committee members' biorhythms. Ask Thomas K. Welch, the former president of the Salt Lake Bid Committee, who was acquitted in 2003 of charges that he illegally influenced I.O.C. members to secure their votes.

Bid cities are no longer allowed to ply voters with college tuition, ski trips or geishas, but this new system doesn't make the bidding any more predictable.

Would New York be the benefactor of geopolitical backlash, which, for once, didn't involve the United States? Last month, the French voted to reject a European Union constitution, leaving Paris vulnerable in the critical period before the I.O.C.'s vote July 6 in Singapore. "I thought when France cast that 'No' vote, that might be what New York needed," Welch said. "Paris may be the city to beat, but you don't want to be the front-runner." Favorites have a way of flopping on election day. Paris was ready to toast itself as I.O.C. members were voting for the host of the 1992 Summer Games, just before Barcelona slipped in as its saboteur. And Lillehammer upset Sofia, Bulgaria, for the 1994 Winter Games by essentially winning the Scandinavian cross-country ski vote (no, really). Atlanta ruined Athens's sentimental lock on the 1996 Summer Games with a last-minute voting surge, and Beijing was ahead of Sydney through two rounds of voting until Sydney won the 2000 Summer Olympics in a late-round shocker. The most bizarre election may have been in 2003, when the I.O.C. convened to vote for the 2010 Winter Games. If you can believe, Pyeongchang, South Korea, without so much as a ski resort, and up to its elbows in nuclear tension with North Korea, almost upset Vancouver for the Olympics in an election decided by three votes. "When the I.O.C. members go in to vote, every city sees a way they can win," Welch said. "It's a secret ballot." The I.O.C. has a way with intrigue. "The exciting thing is, this is an election like no other," said Cherie Blair, the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, and an ambassador for the London 2012 bid. In an interview with editors and reporters at The New York Times yesterday, Blair added: "This is a very exclusive election. It's a small number. All of them are primarily there because of their passion for sport and not because of their passion for politics." She offered a subtle disclaimer, though, admitting that she was not so naïve as to think there weren't "politics with a small 'p' in the sports world." It was politics with a capital P that may have scuttled the NYC2012 bid for good yesterday, clearing the way for Paris and Pottersville.
