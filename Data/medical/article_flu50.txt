It was as if to say that giving a party for the latest wrinkle reducer and going on a United Nations mission were not entirely at odds with each other. They are both about improving the quality of life, he said. It was a gathering in the grand American tradition of people searching for new ways to feel good about themselves. Call it what you will, vanity or life improvement, but this need attracted more than 40 women and one man, from as far away as Hartford, to find out more about Botox, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in April as a cosmetic aid to remove lines between the eyebrows, technically known as glabellar lines. The Dermis Center for Skin and Body Health was the setting for another in a series of Botox parties that have been occurring across the country, mostly in urban settings where people are predisposed to cosmetic surgery and have disposable income to pay for expensive procedures.

(There were no alcoholic beverages because other organizers had been criticized for providing alcohol in a medical setting.) Doctors said they could not remember when a party had been thrown around a noninvasive surgical procedure, not even around Botox's popular wrinkle-reducing cousin, collagen. ''Botox takes half a second to inject, is painless except for the needle prick and most people are happy with it,' said Dr. Joseph B. O'Connell, chief of plastic surgery at Bridgeport Hospital and spokesman for the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. ''Collagen can be messy and painful, and so it seems more like a medical procedure.'' A nurse pushed aside the bangs of Laurie Kendal-Ellis, 46, owner of a physical therapy and fitness center in Woodbridge, and applied a dab of numbing cream above her nose. Ms. Kendal-Ellis, who was one of 10 who received injections at the party, mused that if Botox relaxed the lines between her eyes, she would have to cut her bangs. ''I think the party is a great concept because you get the support of women and get to ask people how they feel about it,'' she said. ''It's a different world out there.'' Before F.D.A. approval, plastic surgeons, dermatologists and ophthalmologists were using Botox without fanfare. The F.D.A. approved Botox, or botulinum toxin type A, in 1989 to treat medical conditions involving muscular spasms and twitches, like uncontrollable eye blinking. Since then doctors have been using a diluted and refined form to smooth foreheads, reduce crow's feet and eyebrow lines. The approval changed the way doctors operate. Now they could invite potential patients to a Botox party. It is difficult to identify the first Botox party, but Michele Brownstein, president of the public relations firm dMk Communications in Branford, and orchestrator of the Dermis Center party, remembered hearing about one in Los Angeles. Ms. Brownstein's client is Dr. Kirwan, also the director of the Dermis Center, and so she thought, why not throw a Botox party. Plugged as the first Botox party in the area, it attracted dozens of people of all ages and professions, including one man who referred to himself as a ''Botox junkie.''

''My friends think I'm shallow, but for me it's a physiological boost.'' The Botox starts working within 24 to 48 hours, said Christine Cassiano, a spokeswoman for Allergan, the maker of Botox Cosmetic in Irvine, Calif. After 30 days, the patient should see the full effect of the Botox treatment, before it fades in three to four months, she said. Allergan officials expect Botox sales, which include medical and cosmetic drug sales, could jump by nearly 35 percent this year, generating $420 million for the company, Ms. Cassiano said. About one-third of sales stem from Botox cosmetics. The drug company has committed $50 million to an advertising campaign. and local doctors and spa owners said they had already noted an increase in Botox inquiries. Depending on the doctor, patients are paying $300 to $1,000 a treatment, three to four times a year. The procedure is not covered by insurance. Dr. Kirwan charges $500 per area treated, which includes the lines around the corner of the eyes, the horizontal forehead lines, and the lines between the eyebrows.

''When I first started, the average was between 35 and 45 years old,'' he said. It's an ounce of prevention, said Megan Doll, 32, who works at WPLR radio station in Milford. ''I want to prevent lines from forming.'' There are some limitations to Botox. Allergan advises doctors not to administer Botox to people over 65. ''The limitation is that the facial architecture is so deep that the lines will still be there,'' Dr. Kirwan said. There are also pre-existing medical conditions where Botox shouldn't be used. ''Botox is not conducive to patients who have neurological problems, such as mysthenia, which is an overall weakening of muscles,'' Ms. Cassiano said. ''You don't want to further that condition.'' But generally, it is safe, effective and has almost no downtime, Dr. O'Connell said. The common side effects are minor, including headaches, which affect about 13 percent of Botox recipients, according to Allergan. Other side affects include respiratory infections, eyelid droops, nausea and flu-like symptoms. Of the 850,000 who received Botox injections last year, fewer than 4 percent reported these side effects.

He referred to a recent news article in ''Plastic Surgery,'' a monthly magazine, citing the growth of cosmetic boutiques, where paramedical personnel often perform nonsurgical procedures, without a supervising physician. ''Flying is generally pretty safe, but if you put a bus driver behind the controls of a 747, bad things will happen,'' he said. Some doctors have expressed concern that Botox parties will compromise the physician-patient relationship. Dr. David J. Leffell, professor of dermatology and surgery at Yale University's School of Medicine, said, ''Botox parties diminishes the level of patient care.'' These parties, he added, point to a systemic problem in medicine, the commercialization of the profession. ''It's becoming where the drug manufacturer is having a closer relationship with the consumer,'' he said. Dr. Leffell has a clinical practice at Yale, where future dermatologists train and treat patients, he said. ''I use Botox, but I use it selectively,'' he said. Some spa owners said they have no intention of offering Botox treatments. Patricia O'Regan Brown, president and chief executive of Derma Clinic in Westport, said she would not incorporate Botox into her services. ''Just because you're a spa, it doesn't authorize you to do a medical procedure,'' said Ms. O'Regan Brown, who is not affiliated with Dermis. In the battle against wrinkles, Dermis offered another Botox party in mid-June because the response to the first party was so overwhelming, Ms. Brownstein said. Paul Cassella, 45, an advertising executive in New Haven, said that he did not have good results the first time he tried Botox a few years ago but that he had since switched plastic surgeons and was more satisfied. ''I had these horrible deep forehead furrows, and I'm in a young man's business and I've got to look like I'm keeping up with the fast-paced pack,'' he said.
