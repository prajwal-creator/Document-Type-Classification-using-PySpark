Previews and Openings ‘Constellations’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Jan. 13) Quantum theory provides the structural conceit for this multiverse romance from the British playwright Nick Payne (“If There Is I Haven’t Found It Yet”) and the director Michael Longhurst. A co-production of Manhattan Theater Club and London’s Royal Court, the play features Jake Gyllenhaal as a beekeeper and Ruth Wilson as his physicist honey. Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, 212-239-6200, constellationsbroadway.com. (Alexis Soloski) ‘Dying for It’ (in previews; opens on Jan. 8) Josef Stalin didn’t like it. Will you? The Atlantic Theater Company offers Moira Buffini’s adaptation of Nikolai Erdman’s “The Suicide,” a play that was banned in Soviet Russia. Under Neil Pepe’s direction, Joey Slotnick stars as a depressed man bent on self-slaughter, and Jeanine Serralles is his wearied wife. Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, 866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Soloski) ‘Every Brilliant Thing’ (in previews; opens on Sunday) When Duncan Macmillan’s comedy debuted at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August, The Guardian called it “one of the funniest plays you’ll ever see about depression.” Jonny Donahoe plays a youngster trying to cheer his suicidal mother with a list of all that’s good in the world, including roller coasters, otters and the color yellow. Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, 212-868-4444, barrowstreettheatre.com. (Soloski) ‘Honeymoon in Vegas’ (in previews; opens on Jan. 15) What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. What happens in New Jersey? Not so much. After a successful run at the Paper Mill Playhouse, this musical adaptation of the 1992 film convinced its producers to take a gamble and bring it to Broadway. The director Gary Griffin deals in Rob McClure and Brynn O’Malley as a pair of young romancers, with Tony Danza as a wily kingpin. Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, 877-250-2929, honeymoonbroadway.com. (Soloski) ‘Into the Woods’ (previews start on Thursday; opens on Jan. 22) Do James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim’s woods seem a little less populous? That’s because the Roundabout Theater Company has engaged the acclaimed Fiasco Theater troupe to perform the musical with just 10 actors and a piano. Reviewing the show’s run last year at the McCarter Theater Center in Princeton, Ben Brantley wrote, “true to form, the Fiasco team continues to keep things simple, the better to bring out the material’s complexity.” Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Soloski) ‘Manhattan Parisienne’ (performances start on Thursday) “Les Misérables” fans can feel that much less miserable now that the lyricist and librettist Alain Boublil of that show is debuting his new play at 59E59 Theaters. Directed by Graciela Daniele and starring Mr. Boublil’s wife, Marie Zamora, the show centers on a French chanteuse and a New York musician who spend a rainy night trading classic tunes. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Soloski) ‘Not the Messiah (He’s a Very Naughty Boy)’ (performances start on Monday) As Monty Python noted in the 1979 film “Life of Brian,” the meek have had a hard time of it. The brash members of that comedy troupe, however, are doing very well for themselves. Now Eric Idle of Monty Python fame, aided by the composer John Du Prez, has transformed “Life of Brian” into a comic oratorio. The Collegiate Chorale’s two-night performance of this work at Carnegie Hall includes solo numbers from Victoria Clark, Marc Kudisch and Lauren Worsham. Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org. (Soloski) ‘Pocatello’ (in previews; opens on Monday) A lot of playwrights can’t be bothered with the flyover district, but that’s where the MacArthur-winning writer Samuel D. Hunter lives. Artistically, anyway. In this new play, directed by Davis McCallum and set in small-town Idaho, T.R. Knight plays the lonely manager of an Olive Garden-ish restaurant, unsoothed by unlimited breadsticks. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org. (Soloski) ‘Soul Doctor’ (in previews; opens on Sunday) This musical odyssey — returning to the stage after a short run on Broadway last year — examines the life of “The Singing Rabbi,” Shlomo Carlebach, a key figure in popular Jewish music, and his friendship with Nina Simone. The show is directed by Mindy Cooper, with a book by Daniel S. Wise and lyrics by David Schechter. Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood) Broadway ‘Aladdin’ Casey Nicholaw (“The Book of Mormon”) directs and choreographs (and choreographs, and choreographs) the latest Disney musical, adapted from the 1992 animated movie. While the familiar formulas are not entirely abandoned, Mr. Nicholaw and the book writer, Chad Beguelin, stuff so much splashy, shticky business into this show that the more syrupy bits hardly register. James Monroe Iglehart stands out as the showboating, scene-stealing genie (2:20). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, 866-870-2717, aladdinthemusical.com. (Isherwood) ‘Beautiful: The Carole King Musical’ This friendly, formulaic jukebox show about the New York-born singer-songwriter might as well be called “Brooklyn Girl,” so closely does it adhere to the template of the megahit “Jersey Boys” (about the Four Seasons). Jessie Mueller, though, is extraordinary as Ms. King, making us feel the connection between a singer and her songs (2:25). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley) ‘Cabaret’ Only a decade after it closed, Sam Mendes and Rob Marshall’s popular, audience-teasing reincarnation of this classic musical feels as if it never left us. Alan Cumming seems to be having the time of his life reprising the creepy, tragic M.C., a role he redefined for the ages. In her Broadway debut, Emma Stone is scintillating as an attention-addicted Sally Bowles (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley) ★ ‘The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time’ Simon Stephens’s adaptation of Mark Haddon’s best-selling novel, about an autistic boy’s coming-of-age, is one of the most fully immersive works ever to wallop Broadway. Be prepared to have all your emotional and sensory buttons pushed. Marianne Elliott (“War Horse”) directs the excellent cast, led by Alex Sharp, and the dazzling technical team (2:25). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, 212-239-6200, curiousonbroadway.com. (Brantley) ‘A Delicate Balance’ Though embodied by the stellar likes of Glenn Close and John Lithgow, the angsty suburbanites at the center of Pam MacKinnon’s revival of Edward Albee’s existential drawing-room drama have the flattened dimensions of specimens under glass. The cast (with the welcome exceptions of Clare Higgins and Bob Balaban) seems to be giving us the play instead of living it (2:45). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, 212-329-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Disgraced’ Ayad Akhtar’s tense, turbulent Pulitzer Prize-winner about the clash between Islamic faith and modern culture comes roaring onto Broadway with a superb, mostly new cast under Kimberly Senior’s taut direction. Hari Dhillon gives a coiled, stealthy performance as the Pakistani-born, well-heeled and thoroughly assimilated New Yorker whose assumptions about his identity are shaken when his complacent life comes unraveled. Gretchen Mol is excellent as his artist wife, and Josh Radnor (“How I Met Your Mother”), Karen Pittman and Danny Ashok give fine support (1:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, disgracedonbroadway.com. (Isherwood) ‘The Elephant Man’ Bradley Cooper distorts himself with self-obliterating grace in this sturdy revival of Bernard Pomerance’s instructive, carefully arranged drama about a freak of nature in Victorian England. But the most emotionally involving performance comes from Alessandro Nivola as a surgeon suffering a crises of faith. Scott Ellis directs a cast that also includes an eccentric Patricia Clarkson (1:55). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, elephantmanbroadway.com. (Brantley) ‘Hedwig and the Angry Inch’ Michael C. Hall plays an “internationally ignored song stylist” of uncertain gender in John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask’s 1998 rock musical about love and loss. Michael Mayer directed this mightily entertaining exercise in crowd control (1:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, 212-239-6200, hedwigbroadway.com. (Brantley) ‘If/Then’ This new musical from Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey (“Next to Normal”) is a gleaming drawing board of a show, full of polished surfaces and clearly drawn lines. The shiny-voiced Idina Menzel portrays a conflicted urban planner pondering two different roads her life might have taken. The show feels less like a variation on a theme than a dogged reiteration of it (2:35). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, 877-250-2929, ifthenthemusical.com. (Brantley) ‘The Illusionists: Witness the Impossible’ Seven talented tricksters are drowning in a sea of cheese in this overproduced, overblown magic show (2:00). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, 800-745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood) ‘It’s Only a Play’ Names drop like hailstones in this revised revival of Terrence McNally’s comedy about the anxious opening night of a Broadway turkey. Celebrity performers (including Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Stockard Channing) sling a lot of mud at other celebrities, sometimes hilariously. Jack O’Brien directs with gusto this fizzy, overlong work that eventually goes flat. Mr. Lane is sterling (2:30). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, itsonlyaplay.com. (Brantley) ‘The Last Ship’ A shipbuilding town in decline is the setting for this earnest, ambitious musical with a wonderful score by Sting (who is now starring), and a somewhat diffuse book by John Logan (“Red”) and Brian Yorkey (“Next to Normal”). Fine performances — notably Michael Esper as the wayward son and Rachel Tucker as the love he left behind — enliven the proceedings, as does the atmospheric production directed by Joe Mantello (2:25). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, 877-250-2929, thelastship.com. (Isherwood) ‘Les Misérables’ It’s back — again. Capitalizing on the popular movie, Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil’s musical about the French fellow who steals a loaf of bread and lives to regret it storms Broadway in a new production. Ramin Karimloo, as the long-suffering bread-stealer, and Will Swenson, as his relentless foe, give a sterling performances (2:50). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) ★ ‘On the Town’ John Rando’s take on this merry mating dance of a musical from 1944, about sailors on shore leave, feels as fresh as first sunlight. With airborne choreography by Joshua Bergasse, the production presents a parallel-universe New York where hectic urban life acquires the grace of a storybook ballet. It’s a bustling, jostling cartoon that floats like a swan (2:35). Lyric Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, 800-982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley) Image Pico Alexander and Colby Minifie in "Punk Rock." Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times ‘The Real Thing’ Authenticity is conspicuous only by its absence in Sam Gold’s revival of Tom Stoppard’s 1982 comedy about one all-too-witty writer’s emotional block. Despite a talented big-name cast led by Ewan McGregor and Maggie Gyllenhaal and the expected witty dialogue, evidence of real feelings, real chemistry and real life in general is dishearteningly scarce (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley) ‘The River’ Playing a withholding man in a woodland cabin in Jez Butterworth’s cryptic tease of a play, Hugh Jackman squelches his natural urge to ingratiate and ascends to a new level as a stage actor. Comparable claims cannot be made for Mr. Butterworth’s willfully enigmatic drama, though it has been beautifully staged by Ian Rickson. Expect to leave hungry (1:25). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, 212-239-6200, theriveronbroadway.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Side Show’ This 1997 musical by Bill Russell and Henry Krieger about the real-life conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton, who became vaudeville stars in the 1930s, has received a thrilling revival. The rich score, and a newly revised book with contributions from the director, Bill Condon (best known for his film work), establish this adventurous musical as an indispensable ticket for the season. Erin Davie and Emily Padgett are luminous and affecting as the twins united by flesh but separated by their divergent ambitions (2:30). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, sideshowbroadway.com. (Isherwood) ★ ‘This Is Our Youth’ As brought to thin-skinned, full-blooded life by Michael Cera, Kieran Culkin and Tavi Gevinson, the three young characters in Anna D. Shapiro’s kinetically charged revival of this fine Kenneth Lonergan play are in a state of permanent free-fall. They exquisitely capture the sense of being lost, formless and on your own that descends with the end of adolescence (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, 212-239-6200, thisisouryouthbroadway.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘You Can’t Take It With You’ A lot of shows make you laugh. But Scott Ellis’s felicitous revival of Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman’s 1936 comedy about an improbably happy family has you beaming from curtain to curtain. The delicious assorted nuts onstage include James Earl Jones, Rose Byrne, Kristine Nielsen and the sly comic genius Annaleigh Ashford (2:20). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) Off Broadway ‘The Asphalt Christmas’ The good news for audiences at Todd Michael’s satirical mash-up of old Hollywood movies, Christmas-related and otherwise, is that an exorcism is performed onstage. The bad news is that the play, directed by Lawrence Lesher, falls flat much of the time. Its would-be madcap nature means that it dashes off in multiple directions. Sometimes this works. More often, it doesn’t (1:30). The Lion Theater, Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, theasphaltchristmas.com. (Laura Collins-Hughes) ‘Barceló con Hielo’ Marcos Antonio Rodríguez stars in his own sociopolitical drama with ghosts. The plot points don’t all cohere, but this Repertorio Español production offers naughty-word humor and textured personal dynamics (1:45). Repertorio Español at Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, 212-225-9999, repertorio.org. (Anita Gates) ★ ‘Bayside! The Musical’ Attending this bawdy, ridiculous, unauthorized parody of the harebrained sitcom “Saved by the Bell” is a bit like going to a midnight screening of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” given the many inside jokes and synchronized audience responses. Audience members know the material so well because half the humor comes from merely reproducing every ludicrous plot twist and trope from the TV show (including Zack’s giant cellphone, Becky the Duck and other allusions that will be familiar to longtime fans). The other half of the humor is just good old-fashioned raunch, usually playing up the horrifying ways to reinterpret a squeaky-clean children’s show (2:00). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, 212-388-0388, baysidethemusical.com. (Catherine Rampell) ‘The Bullpen’ Joe Assadourian, who served 12 years in prison for attempted murder, wrote and stars in this very funny one-man show about the characters he met while awaiting his trial (1:05). Playroom Theater, 151 West 46th Street, 212-967-8278, stepinthebullpen.com. (Ken Jaworowski) ‘A Christmas Memory’ The Irish Repertory Theater’s musical version of the Truman Capote short story is as slight as a popcorn strand, as wispy as tinsel. A tale of a boy’s attachment to his childlike cousin (Alice Ripley), it is an exercise in holiday nostalgia. In cold blood? More like in warm batter (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, 212-727-2737, irishrep.org. (Soloski) ‘Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical’ The strapping man inside the shaggy green suit is the Tony winner Shuler Hensley, and his Grinch is magnificent, a charismatic showman of a menace who will never truly frighten the children. If only he didn’t have to carry the whole production. His strutting, preening performance is by far the best thing about it (1:30). Theater at Madison Square Garden, 866-858-0008, theateratmsg.com. (Collins-Hughes) ★ ’50 Shades! The Musical’ When it comes to potential for satire, E.L. James’s she-porn best seller, “50 Shades of Grey,” seems as easy a target as you could shake a sex toy at. That said, this exuberant takeoff handily delivers the goods, barreling along with a score steeped in show tunes, R&B, gospel, Gilbert and Sullivan and lyrics packed with references to various practices and orifices. “This is real life; this isn’t a book,” says Ana, the show’s heroine, to her tycoon suitor. “If it was, it would be terrible.” It certainly would. But “50 Shades!” is a musical parody, and a very entertaining one (1:30). Elektra Theater, 300 West 43rd Street, Clinton, 212-352-3101, 50shadesthemusical.com. (Andy Webster) ★ ‘Here Lies Love’ This invigorating poperetta, conceived by David Byrne, sets a new standard for audience participation. Or do I mean coercion? In this heady show about the heady life of Imelda Marcos, staged with infinite inventiveness by Alex Timbers, all the world’s a dance floor, and all the men and women (including the audience) merely disco rats (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley) ‘I See You’ This two-hander by Kate Robin, who works on the Showtime series “The Affair,” is about a man and a woman, married to others, who fall into an unexpected intimacy after meeting while watching over their respective children in a kiddie ball pit. It’s amusing enough, and even a little insightful by the end, but the “she” half (played by Danielle Slavick) is one of those people who rant about everything — climate change, iPads, gluten — which undercuts the piece’s credibility; that’s the kind of stranger not many people would want to get to know better (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, 866-811-4111, theflea.org. (Neil Genzlinger) ‘iLuminate’ More spectacle than story, “iLuminate” offers technology as its most dazzling star. Conceived, produced and directed by Miral Kotb, a former software engineer, the show employs about a dozen talented, indefatigable young actor-dancers, encased in black suits wired with digitally controlled lights. Performing in total darkness to a score combining hip-hop, jazz and classical influences, they portray the tale of an artist whose magic paintbrush is stolen for evil ends. Much of the action is like a neon comic book, but it does have its magic moments (:55). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, iluminate.com. (Laurel Graeber) ‘The Invisible Hand’ Ayad Akhtar’s latest drama, about the dark connections between money and terrorism, finds an American banker held hostage by Islamic militants in Pakistan. Justin Kirk gives a canny performance as the Citibank exec who tries to keep himself alive by helping his captors work the global markets (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, 212-279-4200, nytw.org. (Isherwood) ‘Lennon: Through a Glass Onion’ In this two-man show, the Australian actor John R. Waters (accompanied by the pianist Stewart D’Arrietta) wisely doesn’t attempt a complete impersonation. There are no glasses or beard or mop top here, just an evocative approximation of the voice and a deeply felt reflection of the man. The show amply covers spirited rockers, but much of it explores the darker depths that so distinguished Lennon from the sunnier Paul McCartney. The darkest corners — Lennon’s early abusive romantic relationships and his heroin use — are avoided. (No “Cold Turkey” here.) But the Beatle fanatics sure to see this show won’t mind (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Gramercy, 800-982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Webster) ‘Lost Lake’ The indie film actor John Hawkes (“The Sessions,” “Winter’s Bone”) and Tracie Thoms give terrific performances in David Auburn’s two-hander about people facing similar crises. Mr. Auburn avoids the pitfall of predictability — no romance ensues — but he isn’t able to work up much dramatic heat in this muted drama (1:30). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, 212-581-1212, lostlakemtc.com. (Isherwood) ★ ‘Lypsinka! The Trilogy’ The greatest chanteuse who never sung a note returns to the New York stage after an absence of nearly 10 years. That this three-part work, the creation of Lypsinka’s alter-ego, John Epperson, brilliantly assesses the toll taken on women by their facades should surprise no one. The third installment (“Show Trash”) introduces the shy man behind the overpowering diva (running in repertory: “Lypsinka: The Boxed Set”: 1:15; “The Passion of the Crawford”: 1:15; “John Epperson: Show Trash”: 1:30). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, tweedtheater.org/lypsinkatrilogy. (Brantley) ‘Me, My Mouth & I’ Joy Behar, who for years was one of the stars of the daytime talk show “The View,” takes the stage in this one-woman mixture of autobiography and tried-and-true comic shtick. If you liked her on “The View,” and not everybody did, you’ll like this (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, 866-811-4111, cherrylanetheatre.org. (Genzlinger) ‘The Oldest Boy’ Sarah Ruhl’s new play explores the conflict between the nuclear family and Tibetan Buddhist tradition, when an American boy is identified as the reincarnation of a revered monk and teacher. Celia Keenan-Bolger portrays the conflicted mother in this tenderly drawn but tame and rather predictable play, directed by Rebecca Taichman (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 212-239-6200, lct.org. (Isherwood) ‘On the Other Side of the River’ New Worlds Theater Project, which specializes in English adaptations of Yiddish works, revives this deeply dark and symbolic 1906 play in a production that’s more admirable than enjoyable (1:00). Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, 866-811-4111, newworldsproject.org. (Jaworowski) ‘A Particle of Dread (Oedipus Variations)’ Sam Shepard sends a forensic scientist into the realm of classical mythology to investigate the mystery of Oedipus Rex (Stephen Rea). Nancy Meckler’s time-traveling production doesn’t dig up many new insights, but Mr. Shepard seems to be having a good time contemplating the nature of tragedy and the persistence of myth in memory (1:25). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Brantley) ‘Pitbulls’ Keith Josef Adkins has written a resplendently foulmouthed melodrama about “trailer trash in its natural habitat.” As staged by Leah C. Gardiner, this tale of a dead dog, a corrupt town and a rebellious, lust-provoking hillbilly (Yvette Ganier) sags at moments. But its dialogue is often as flavorful as pulled-pork barbecue, marinated in a piquant secret sauce (2:00). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, 866-811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Brantley) ‘The Seagull’ Chekhov’s classic has been modernized by the young British playwright Anya Reiss, and as performed by the Bedlam troupe, directed by Eric Tucker, this loose-limbed production can feel a bit like a thoughtful, generous spirited acting class. But it has an easygoing accessibility that suggests there is no reason to be afraid of Anton Chekhov. Andrus Nichols is a first-rate Masha (2:20). Sheen Center, 18 Bleecker Street, near Elizabeth Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, theatrebedlam.org. (Brantley) Image "Tristan & Yseult" with Dominic Marsh and Hannah Vassallo, at St.Ann’s Warehouse. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times ★ ‘Sense & Sensibility’ Gossip gallops in the Bedlam troupe’s enchantingly athletic take on the perils of courtship according to Jane Austen, adapted by Kate Hamill and directed by Eric Tucker. Transposing Austen into the jauntier key of Dickens, this production reminds us that few theater companies ride narrative momentum as resourcefully or enthusiastically as Bedlam does. It’s an unconditional delight (2:30). Sheen Center, 18 Bleecker Street, near Elizabeth Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, theatrebedlam.org. (Brantley) ‘Sex Tips for Straight Women From a Gay Man’ Matt Murphy’s one-act is a blend of a bachelorette party at Chippendales and the embarrassing midnight show at some tourist trap in Pigalle. It has a talented cast, but it is no “Queer Eye” (1:20). 777 Theater, 777 Eighth Avenue, at 47th Street, 888-841-4111, sextipsplay.com. (Gates) ★ ‘Swamp Juice’ Jeff Achtem’s mostly wordless, largely wondrous and fairly repulsive puppet play centers on a despicable dude who cruises the bayou torturing various small animals. It’s a nasty story, but there’s real virtuosity in the telling. Under his flailing fingers, unlikely puppets — made from found and scavenged materials — become all manner of flora and fauna (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, 212-868-4444, barrowstreettheatre.com. (Soloski) ★ ‘Tail! Spin!’ Hanky-panky-in-high-office scandals of recent years are transformed into comic burlesque in this clever comedy by Mario Correa. Drawing verbatim on the public record, the play, nimbly directed by Dan Knechtges, slices and dices the misbehavior of four politicians: Larry Craig (airport bathroom sting), Mark Foley (he of the underage page scandal), Mark Sanford (“hiking the Appalachian Trail”) and, of course, Anthony Weiner. The excellent cast includes Rachel Dratch, playing all the female roles (1:15). Lynn Redgrave Theater at Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, cultureproject.org. (Isherwood) ★ ‘Tamburlaine, Parts I and II’ The nations-conquering, mass-murdering title character of Christopher Marlowe’s 1587 behemoth is here embodied by a truly titanic John Douglas Thompson as a force of nature in the sense that typhoons and tidal waves are. Michael Boyd’s surprisingly enjoyable, fast-moving interpretation is packed with pageantry, stylized violence and a coruscating theatrical wit that lets us chuckle uneasily even as we recoil (3:00). Polonsky Shakespeare Center, 262 Ashland Place at Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, 866-811-4111, tfana.org. (Brantley) ‘Wiesenthal’ This interesting though occasionally long-winded one-man show (written by and starring Tom Dugan) looks at the life of the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal (1:30). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, wiesenthaltheplay.com. (Jaworowski) Off Off Broadway ‘Fabulous! the Queen of New Musical Comedies’ This show about two drag queens aboard a cruise ship, pretending to be real women, is a little “Some Like It Hot,” a little “Anything Goes” and a lot of good-natured farce with a goofy innocence (2:30). New Write Act Repertory Theater, 300 West 43rd Street, Clinton, 800-836-3006, brownpapertickets.com. (Gates) ‘Rollo’s Wild Oat’ Sweet and fusty, Clare Beecher Kummer’s 1920 comedy centers on a moneyed chap who insists on starring in “Hamlet” before resigning himself to stewardship of the family air-brake business. Though Kummer satirizes passé performance styles and actorly fussiness and the production includes some droll props and costumes, the jest is not exactly infinite (2:30). Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, 800-8388-3006, metropolitanplayhouse.org. (Soloski) ‘War Lesbian’ Kristine Haruna Lee’s lively, haphazard play about a young woman (the delightful Erin Markey) on a vague mission whirls together Greek mythology, daytime TV, lesbian pulp fiction and F.T. Marinetti’s Futurist manifesto. It is a show full of impulses and ideas, though without much of a story. But under Jordan Fein’s direction, the gender queer jumble is enthusiastically performed (1:30). Dixon Place, 161 Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, 866-811-4111, dixonplace.org. (Soloski) Extravaganzas ★ Big Apple Circus “Metamorphosis” is the theme of the latest edition of the Big Apple Circus, now nested at Lincoln Center for the holidays. Considering the intimate scale of this troupe, you could say this production starts modestly, only to spread its wings and soar. The company, now in its 37th year, doesn’t only have impressive animals and breathtaking acrobatic skills; it has a lot of heart, too (2:00). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, 888-541-3750, bigapplecircus.org. (Webster) ‘Cirque Ziva’ The Golden Dragon Acrobats, from China, have put together an impressive collection of gravity-defying acts that will impress children and adults alike. Ping Gao’s contortionist routine is the high point (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, 646-562-2200, newvictory.org. (Genzlinger) ‘Fuerza Bruta: Wayra’ The latest bit of sensory-overload brand extension from the creators of “De la Guarda” is a shiny, ever-shifting kinetic spectacle bent on disorientation. A high-volume, augmented remix of “Fuerzabruta,” this energetic show is rife with not-especially-impressive acrobatics, throbbing music, many-colored lights and high winds from machines set at storm speed (1:20). Daryl Roth Theater, 20 Union Square East, at 15th Street, 212-239-6200, fuerzabrutanyc.com. (Collins-Hughes) ‘Queen of the Night’ The latest and most lavish of this city’s immersive theater experiments includes cocktails, a meal and a circus-style floor show, in addition to any number of possible intimate, eroticism-tinged (but PG-13) encounters with the comely young cast members. The show is not for those prone to social anxiety, but it’s full of gaudy spectacle, with a fin-de-Bloomberg-era vibe (2:45). Diamond Horseshoe at the Paramount Hotel, 235 West 46th Street, 866-811-4111, queenofthenightnyc.com. (Isherwood) ‘Radio City Christmas Spectacular’ Rockettes, angels and magi, dancing teddy bears and a 3-D aerial tour in Santa’s sleigh — this show is as much a celebration of the city as of the holidays (1:30).

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, 800-745-3000, ticketmaster.com. Last Chance ‘Allegro’ (closes on Sunday) The minimalist director John Doyle deploys his tried-and-true formula of doubling actors as musicians in this glowing production of a seldom-revived Rodgers and Hammerstein curiosity from 1947. Though the show (about a morally conflicted small-town doctor) remains an odd duck, it sings beautifully, while making us newly aware of both the harmonies and deliberate dissonance within Rodgers’s score (1:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, classicstage.org. (Brantley) ‘A Christmas Carol, Oy! HANUKKAH, Merry Kwanzaa’ (closes on Sunday) The Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theater has done enchanting work in the past, but this marionette show has too many pointed anachronisms and not enough warmth (1:00). La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, 212-475-7710, lamama.org. (Gates) ‘Love Letters’ (closes on Sunday) A.R. Gurney’s quietly moving epistolary play made its Broadway premiere with a sterling Brian Dennehy and an extraordinary Mia Farrow breathing vivid life into the lifelong correspondence between a man and a woman from the East Coast upper crust. The production now features Alan Alda and Candice Bergen. Gregory Mosher directs (1:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, 800-982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood) ‘Major Barbara’ (closes on Sunday) Inescapably playful and undeniably serious, Bernard Shaw’s 1905 play pits a Salvation Army crusader (Hannah Cabell) against her armorer father (Dan Daily). Though occasionally stagey, David Staller’s production presents its ideas lucidly while never stinting the emotions that underlie them. Mr. Staller might easily adopt the armorer’s motto: “Unashamed” (2:15). Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Soloski) ‘On a Stool at the End of the Bar’ (closes on Sunday) In Robert Callely’s overstuffed new drama, set in the 1980s, a family’s tranquillity is blown to smithereens when Tony (Timothy John Smith) discovers that his longtime girlfriend, Chris (Antoinette Thornes), used to be a man. Michael Parva’s calm direction, and Mr. Smith’s sensitive performance lower the play’s high emotional pitch, but Chris’s pain and passion never feel genuine (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Collins-Hughes) ★ ‘Our Lady of Kibeho’ (closes on Sunday) Katori Hall’s transfixing drama, set in Rwanda in the early 1980s, explores what happens when three Catholic schoolgirls claim to see visions of the Virgin Mary. The superb cast, under the sensitive direction of Michael Greif, makes us luxuriate in the suspension of disbelief — at least until the girls’ visions turn dark, and the pleasure turns to terror (2:20). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood) ★ ‘Punk Rock’ (closes on Sunday) Simon Stephens’s tender, ferocious and frightening play about a group of British school students during exam season inspires wonder that anybody makes it to the end of adolescence. Directed by Trip Cullman, this piercing study of kids’ inhumanity to kids is enacted by a marvelous cast that dares to go places most grown-ups like to forget exist (1:45). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, 212-352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Brantley) ‘Send for the Million Men’ (closes on Saturday) Joseph Silovsky’s rumpled and wry theatrical brief against the 1927 executions of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti incorporates puppets, a robot and Mr. Silovsky’s customary worn old suitcases. Far from a grim entertainment, this is a clever, complex, handmade show about a legal cause célèbre from long ago (1:30). Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, 866-811-4111, here.org. (Collins-Hughes) ★ ‘Smoke’ (closes on Thursday) Kim Davies’s play about two young New Yorkers in a kitchen at a sex party is intense, provocative and exceedingly clever, with two exceptional performances by Stephen Stout and Madeleine Bundy. A study of power, it argues that sex is exactly like every other kind of human interaction, except maybe funnier (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, 212-352-3101, theflea.org. (Gates) ★ ‘Sticks and Bones’ (closes on Sunday) Apprehension permeates every atom of Scott Elliott’s fascinating revival of David Rabe’s strange, angry, messy and deeply disturbing 1971 drama about a Vietnam veteran’s return to a suburban world that refuses to absorb him. A brilliant Bill Pullman and Holly Hunter are a sitcom perfect mom and dad who find their all-American denial under siege (2:45). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-279-4200, thenewgroup.org. (Brantley) ★ ‘Straight White Men’ (closes on Sunday) This fascinating new drama written and directed by Young Jean Lee, among the most versatile and talented playwrights working today, asks us to sympathize with the existential crisis of a white middle-aged man who has refused to conform to the codes of achievement and privilege expected of him. He’s glad to be unhappy — or at least he refuses to pathologize his lack of worldly success — but his family can’t abide the idea (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood) ★ ‘Tristan & Yseult’ (closes on Sunday) The lines between pleasure and pain keep blurring in this ecstasy-drunk British import from the Kneehigh Theater (“Brief Encounter”), which retells the tragedy of its doomed-to-love title characters. Long stretches of Emma Rice’s ever-surprising, musically eclectic production feel like a giddy party. Then before you know it, you’ve been ambushed by a sorrow that makes your eyes sting (2:15). St. Ann’s Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, 718-254-8779, stannswarehouse.org.
