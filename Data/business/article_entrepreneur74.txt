Directed by Irena Salina 1 hour 24 minutes; not rated  A documentary and a three-alarm warning, “Flow” dives into our planet’s most essential resource — and third-largest industry — to find pollution, scarcity, human suffering and corporate profit. And that’s just in the United States. Yet Irena Salina’s astonishingly wide-ranging film is less depressing than galvanizing, an informed and heartfelt examination of the tug of war between public health and private interests. From the dubious quality of our tap water (possibly laced with rocket fuel) to the terrifyingly unpoliced contents of bottled brands (one company pumped from the vicinity of a Superfund site), the movie ruthlessly dismantles our assumptions about water safety and government oversight. Still reeling, we’re given a distressing glimpse of regions embroiled in bitter battles against privatization. In South Africa, villagers drink from stagnant ponds, unable to pay for the water that once was free, and protesters in Bolivia — where waste from a slaughterhouse is dumped into Lake Titicaca — brave gunfire to demand unrestricted access to potable water. And lest we begin to comfort ourselves with first-world distance, Ms. Salina cleverly frames this section with the protracted conflict between the residents of Mecosta County, Mich., and the gluttonous demands of a Nestlé bottling plant.

At the very least it should make you think twice before you take that (unfiltered) shower.

Directed by Manish Acharya 1 hour 28 minutes; not rated “Loins of Punjab Presents,” a witty musical comedy with a sharp political edge, is built on a satisfyingly simple premise. Over the course of a weekend  a motley crew of contestants gathers in a New Jersey hotel to compete in “Desi Idol,” an “American Idol”-style singing competition sponsored by a local pork-loin empire. The songs come from Bollywood, with the contestants drawn, for the most part, from the area’s South Asian immigrant community, the exception being a certain Josh Cohen (Michael Raimondi), lover of Indian culture (and of a girl from Mumbai) who dreams of starting a “joga” craze (jogging plus yoga). The droll, affable cast includes a shy, pretty girl  (Ishitta Sharma) with a domineering family; a Machiavellian socialite (Shabana Azmi); a struggling actress  (Ayesha Dharker) who, like Margaret Cho,  is deemed “not Asian enough” by casting directors;  and a politicized, would-be bhangra rapper who calls himself the Turbanotorious BDG (Ajay Naidu) and shows up with tons of attitude and a hot male lover (Kory Bassett). Directed with a cheerful touch by Manish Acharya from a warm, insightful screenplay he wrote with Anuvab Pal,  “Loins of Punjab” joins show-time antics to sociocultural commentary without reducing its characters, colorful as they are, to cartoons. NATHAN LEE THE LITTLE RED TRUCK Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Rob Whitehair 1 hour 38 minutes  All year long, all across North America, the bright-eyed actor-directors of the Missoula Children’s Theater disembark from their little red trucks in towns both big (Los Angeles) and small (Somerton, Ariz.) to put on shows. On Monday they hold auditions with the local children. By Tuesday they’re rehearsing a musical version of a classic  story:  “Robin Hood,” “The Little Mermaid.” By Friday, they hope, all the kids know their lines, songs and cues, and by Saturday it’s on with the costumes, on  with the dress rehearsal and on to the big night: the performance of an hourlong musical that has come together — more or less — in just one week.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   And then the group picks up and heads off to tickle the fancy and widen the horizons of the next batch of grinning, goofy peewees (as the littlest ones are called) in, say, Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, Canada. This is the story of “The Little Red Truck,” a documentary by the filmmaker Rob Whitehair, and if it sounds like the cutest thing in the history of cuteness, that’s because it is. It would take a superhuman capacity for cynicism to resist the radiant optimism of the Missoula Children’s Theater players and the unabashed pep of this joyful portrait. Sure, this sweet little movie isn’t going to change the world, but when those little red trucks roll up, and all those little eyes light up, that’s exactly what happens. NATHAN LEE “The Little Red Truck” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes very mild discussions of children with domestic and schoolyard troubles. GREETINGS FROM THE SHORE Opens on Friday in New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia. Directed by Greg Chwerchak 1 hour 56 minutes  The problem with having a big-name actor in your small film is that he tends to underscore the inexperience of some of your other stars. That’s the effect Paul Sorvino has in “Greetings From the Shore,” a watchable-enough summer-at-the-beach tale billed as Gabrielle Berberich’s first feature as writer and producer. (Parts of the story are drawn from her own summers in Lavallette, a New Jersey shore town.) It stars Kim Shaw as a teenager spending her first solo summer in the New Jersey beach town where her family had  gone for years. She lands a job teaching English to a group of mysterious foreigners who are employed by the local yacht club and falls for a particularly good-looking one (David Fumero). Ms. Shaw is, at least at this point, the type of actress you find on the Disney Channel: genetically unable, even when crying, to project anything other than “cute” and never quite able to shake the “Hey, I’m on camera!” look.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   That’s harmless enough in this type of warm-weather reminiscence, until Mr. Sorvino, a real actor and a good one, shows up. He plays a down-on-his-luck fisherman who takes the girl under his wing, and he makes Ms. Shaw and some of the other cast members look like amateurs. The director, Greg Chwerchak (who also gets a writing credit), doesn’t help; he allows several secondary characters to become thudding clichés, trampling the delicate story. NEIL GENZLINGER “Greetings From the Shore” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), supposedly for language, though there is nothing here that would scandalize younger teenagers, the audience who would most enjoy this film.

Directed by Wayne Coyne 1 hour 25 minutes; not rated  Many rock bands have a moment when they flirt with cinema, but the best efforts are not slick productions like “Purple Rain” or “The Wall.”  They’re more like the Monkees’ “Head,” say,  or Led Zeppelin’s “Song Remains the Same”:  endearingly ragged projects, destined for cult status. For the Oklahoma group the Flaming Lips, that movie is “Christmas on Mars.” There are no musical performances on screen, but many appearances by band members, including the singer Wayne Coyne (as a horned alien) and Steven Drozd (as a haunted astronaut in a claustrophobic red-planet outpost). Actors like Fred Armisen, from “Saturday Night Live,” and Adam Goldberg, as well as Isaac Brock of the band Modest Mouse, also have roles. The story — I think — is that oxygen is running out on Christmas Eve; Mr. Coyne, who also directed, arrives in a glowing orb (he says nothing, ensuring maximum mystique) and is persuaded by Mr. Drozd to don a Santa suit. But forget plot. It’s all about textures: black-and-white images with psychedelic bursts; dashes of David Lynch, the ’70s midnight movie “Dark Star” and “2001”; an echo of “The Wizard of Oz”; and, in a riff on maternity, maybe an iota of “The Matrix,” abetted with homemade-looking but sometimes lyrical effects. As for the soundtrack, fans of the excellent Lips album “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots” will know the dreamy ambience to expect. Dude, pass the munchies. ANDY WEBSTER SECRECY Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Peter Galison and Robb Moss 1 hour 20 minutes; not rated  “Secrecy” prowls through the labyrinth of information suppression and, as might be expected in so murky a milieu, winds up a little lost. Directed by Peter Galison and Robb Moss, this nebulous yet evocative documentary is galvanized by the consolidation of executive power under the Bush administration and its growing use of the state-secrets privilege in the post-9/11 era. “Secrecy” is equal parts history lesson, meditative essay, didactic poem and call to arms. If the movie follows no single thread of inquiry, nor sustains any argument or research in depth, it nevertheless explores some chilling corridors of the clandestine.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   “Secrecy” acknowledges the necessity, in principle, of hiding certain types of critical information. In practice, the film finds much to be troubled about, starting with the momentous 1953 Supreme Court decision in United States v. Reynolds that set the legal precedent for the state-secrets privilege and was later revealed to have been founded on dubious grounds. Developing its analysis of what it calls “the modern secrecy system,” a shadowy concept that never quite reveals itself, the movie touches on the push-pull dynamic of the government  versus the press; the culture clash between those shaped by the cold-war paradigm of information hoarding and those alert to the networked sensibility of the Internet era; the private toll of covering up; and the great danger to the public of secrecy for its own sake. NATHAN LEE FORGIVENESS Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Udi Aloni In English, Hebrew and Arabic, with English subtitles 1 hour 37 minutes; not rated  Jewish mental patients and murdered Palestinians unite to solve the problems of the Middle East in “Forgiveness,” a mystifying mishmash of ghost story and group therapy. Flashing backward, forward, up and down, the movie’s bewildering plot follows David (Itay Tiran), a young Israeli-American with unresolved identity issues. To spite his famous father (Michael Sarne), David enlists in the Israeli  Army, where a tragic incident leaves him virtually catatonic. Committed to a mental hospital on the site of a Jewish massacre of a Palestinian village, David bounces between a drug that promises to erase the past and another patient (Moni Moshonov) who urges him to discuss it with the skeletons the inmates are busily exhuming. As dream sequences collide with musical theater, and the agitated shade of a dead girl reappears as the daughter of David’s unlikely Palestinian lover, “Forgiveness” juggles a perplexing number of themes, philosophies and aesthetics. Caught in an endless loop of repressed memories and spiritual aphorisms, the screenplay (by Paul Hond and Udi Aloni, who also directs) disdains to say once what it can repeat several times. The message may be clear — suppress the past at your peril — but the execution is a mess. As for the line-dancing soldiers, your guess is as good as mine. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS THE TREE OF LIFE Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Hava Volterra 1 hour 16 minutes; not rated  The death of her father, Vittorio, propelled Hava Volterra, an engineer and transplant to Los Angeles  from Israel, to explore and document her family’s Jewish Italian roots, about which Vittorio was puzzlingly tight-lipped. With her aunt, Viviana, a spirited octogenarian puppeteer, in tow, she travels throughout Italy and Israel. They visit, among other places, the university where Ms. Volterra’s dad studied physics and the Jewish ghetto in Venice, where he was raised.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   There’s no question that Ms. Volterra has some fascinating ancestors — including Italy’s  first Jewish prime minister and the former New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia — and that “The Tree of Life,” despite an onslaught of dates and facts that often come too rapidly to be absorbed, offers an interesting history lesson  about Jews in Italy since the 13th century. (Psychedelic sequences with digitally enhanced marionettes serve as the most inventive re-creations of past events.) But there’s also a prevailing sense of premeditation;  for example, the camera is conveniently trained on Viviana when she receives the call to join her niece. Ms. Volterra, acting as narrator and interviewee herself, can’t seem to resist the urge to be the star of her own film, which too often feels like a wearisome exercise in self-therapy. LAURA KERN PROUD AMERICAN Opens on Friday nationwide. Directed by Fred Ashman 1 hour 45 minutes; rated G  “Proud American,” a series of dramatic vignettes about tolerance and can-do spirit, aspires to be inspirational, but suffers from its shameless, jackhammer-style manipulation. When a movie, in its opening, says its sponsors (Coca-Cola, MasterCard, Wal-Mart and American Airlines) had no influence on its content, but sticks their logos in the credits, you are suspicious of just who might be calling the shots. As if that weren’t  enough, two sequences recreate the early days of Coke and Wal-Mart (yes, actors play the young Sam and Helen Walton), invoking both corporate behemoths as examples of singular ingenuity. So, the stories: a girl comes to the States from Southeast Asia with her family, overcomes prejudice, marries and becomes a software entrepreneur with her husband; a Jewish family is supported by their neighborhood when skinheads vandalize their home; a boy from the South Side of Chicago transcends his rough neighborhood and becomes a doctor; a Navy Seal loses the use of his legs but triumphs as a wheelchair athlete. These accounts, starring fading television faces like James B. Sikking (the SWAT leader on “Hill Street Blues”) and Ken Howard (“The White Shadow”) proceed in their blunt, Hallmark-moment way. Punctuating the relentless bathos are appearances by the comedian Yakov Smirnoff (you remember: “America — what a country!”) and montage barrages of sun-saturated landscapes, national monuments and softball games, accompanied by generic choral singing. Moviegoers are actually expected to pay for this hollow uplift. Don’t even consider it.
