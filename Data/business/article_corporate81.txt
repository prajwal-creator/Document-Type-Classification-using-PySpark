Technology start-ups that achieve $1 billion in valuation before going public — so-called unicorns — can attract the attention of prominent venture capital firms and draw résumés from top talent across the country. The number is so important that 41 companies are valued at exactly $1 billion, a record, according to the venture capital research firm CB Insights . And 103 start-ups have exceeded the billion-dollar valuation, the firm’s statistics show, even though valuations can be more art than science, based on a wide range of criteria that do not always center on financial data. But in the race to become unicorns — a nickname intended to evoke the rarity of the mythical creature — start-ups have been taking some outsize risks that could end up hurting them. To lure investors who will help propel them over the $1 billion goal line, some start-ups are making deals with those who come in later in the fund-raising process. Those deals can be harmful to employees and earlier investors. The idea of making trade-offs to stretch valuations is not new. What is new is the psychological pressure that founders and executives of private companies face to attain the billion-dollar threshold and the speed at which a downturn in the public markets is affecting private ones. All this magnifies the long-term repercussions of the start-up executives’ short-term aspirations. For professional investors, these deals can guarantee a specified return on an investment if the next transaction — be it another round of funding, an initial public offering or a sale — comes in at a valuation lower than expected. This sometimes happens at the expense of employees, whose stakes are diluted as investors are made whole. It is all fine when the market goes up. But the market has been turbulent. Approximately 30 percent of unicorn investors had negotiated protections against a so-called down-round I.P.O. — a situation in which the results of an offering indicated a lower valuation than the latest round of private funding had — according to a May study by the law firm Fenwick & West. In the case of an acquisition, all unicorns studied by Fenwick & West would have to see their valuations cut by 90 percent, on average, before investors would suffer a loss. The long-term result could be detrimental to some of these start-ups. Engineers and sales representatives who have spent years toiling for their big payday could defect in droves as they watch their on-paper wealth lose value, or await an I.P.O. that has been delayed while the company tries to grow into its valuation. “There’s a greater misalignment between employees and founders on one hand and late-stage investors on the other,” said Shriram Bhashyam, a co-founder of EquityZen , which operates a market on which start-up employees can sell their nonpublic equity compensation. “There’s a lot less downside to be an investor in one of these deals than to be a common-stock investor.” To protect employees from the risk of a down round, some companies have chosen to stay private longer. Start-ups this year are waiting 7.7 years to go public after their first round of funding, up from 5.8 years in 2011, according to data compiled by PitchBook . Unicorn fund-raising rounds outnumbered I.P.O.s and sales four to one through June, according to a different analysis by PitchBook. However, a handful of companies, including Apigee, Box, and Hortonworks, have gone public at a lower valuation than their private rounds indicated over the last year. The mobile security provider Good Technology filed to go public more than a year before BlackBerry bought it in September for $425 million, less than half its $1 billion private valuation. Short-Term Thinking From Wall Street to Washington and in the towers of academia, people are buzzing about what some say is the pernicious focus in corporate America on short-term profits. Nov. 4, 2015 Since this summer’s stock market jitters, it has become even harder for private companies to go public or be sold at a higher valuation, as investors that traditionally focused on public companies have moved to private ones as well. The biggest mutual fund companies, including T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Janus Capital Group and Wellington Management Company, put $16 billion into private companies over the last three years, helping increase valuations, according to data compiled by CB Insights. In 2015, these investors funneled eight times as much into private companies as they did in 2011. And all that is on top of the cash coming from hedge funds, venture capital and private equity firms, and corporate investors. Stock market drops have caused mutual fund managers to begin rethinking and restricting their private investing strategy, said people briefed on those strategies who spoke on the condition of anonymity. And, those people said, w ithout all the investable capital that has been sloshing around Silicon Valley over the last few years, some unicorns have had more difficulty raising subsequent rounds of financing at higher and higher valuations. “A 5 to 10 percent correction normally doesn’t cause any ripples in the private market space,” said Ian D’Souza , a professor of behavioral finance at the New York University Stern School of Business. “It’s literally a contagion brought about by these new investors being brought into the growth space that didn’t exist five years ago.” For the same reason, investors in the public markets have also become pickier about I.P.O.s. Rather than accepting metrics such as revenue growth and user impressions, buyers of shares in recent initial offerings have become more focused on earnings, said Adley Bowden , an analyst at PitchBook. The threat of a lower valuation leaves some unicorns in limbo. For now, they can sit and do nothing, since many have built up war chests. But the cash will not last forever — especially for those companies that tend to spend it quickly. Some of these start-ups will not have grown into the valuations they have sought and will have to take a haircut in their next round. Others may go out of business if they can’t find more capital or a way to sell themselves “You, as an entrepreneur, must make sure the postmoney valuation is a number you can obtain,” said J.B. Pritzker , co-founder and managing partner of the Pritzker Group, which has a venture capital arm. “You don’t want too high of a valuation.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F 2 of the New York edition with the headline: Risks in Running With Unicorns .
