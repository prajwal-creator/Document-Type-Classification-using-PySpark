Back Story  Photo         Credit Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images    On Feb. 22, The Washington Post added a new slogan beneath its nameplate — “Democracy Dies in Darkness . ” The motto was not, The Post said, a response to President Trump’s attacks on the news media, which he has called “the enemy of the people.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Executives at The Post had planned on a slogan long before Mr. Trump even became the Republican presidential nominee. Their criteria was a phrase that “must be memorable and may be slightly uncomfortable for us at first.” The newspaper acknowledged that the motto was “dramatic” and had become fodder for comics (Slate made a list of “ 15 Metal Albums Whose Titles Are Less Dark Than The Washington Post’s New Motto ”). The Columbia Journalism Review pointed out that slogans have been a tradition in American newspapers since the 16th century. Consider such classics as “Daily Diary of the American Dream” (The Wall Street Journal), or “If You Don’t Want It Printed, Don’t Let It Happen” (The Aspen Daily News in Colorado). The New York Times has used “ All the News That’s Fit to Print ” since 1897, but that wasn’t its first motto. When Adolph Ochs bought the paper he held a contest for the new slogan . The winning entry was “It Will Not Soil the Breakfast Cloth.” Charles McDermid contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.
