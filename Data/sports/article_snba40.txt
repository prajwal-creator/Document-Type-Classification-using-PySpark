Nelson was a fine golfer and a great gentleman. But nobody would suggest that Snuffy Stirnweiss was as deserving a batting champion as Ted Williams.  David Pugh Toledo, Ohio To the Sports Editor: The assertion that Tiger Woods’s losses overseas should be applicable to his PGA Tour streak is akin to stating that an injured major league baseball player’s hitting streak should end if, on a rehabilitation assignment, he were to go hitless in a minor league game. Craig Codlin New York Mickelson’s Mental Mistake To the Sports Editor: Re “A Weakness Corrected, Mickelson Moves Ahead,” Feb. 12: Phil Mickelson’s weakness wasn’t one of mechanics. Though he missed 12 fairways in 14 attempts in the final round of the United States Open last year, he was still winning.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   What Mickelson did on that last hole — a double bogey to lose the tournament — was more a mental mistake than anything physical. A mental mistake is the hardest thing for a pro to overcome or to admit. Richard Rainey  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Ridge, N.Y. Gloves Required to Draw Blood To the Sports Editor: The front-page photograph accompanying “Welcoming the Testing Needle, Team Battles Cycling’s Image” (Feb. 13) shows Paul Scott violating one of the cardinal medical principles whenever there is a potential for contact with bodily fluids. He is not wearing gloves while drawing blood. As a former chemist and client director at the U.C.L.A Olympic drug-testing lab, he should certainly know better.

Diamond, M.D. New York On Dividing Division III To the Sports Editor: Re “Division III Seeks Harmony Between Field and Classroom,” Feb. 13: An important point was not emphasized strongly enough. There are no minimum N.C.A.A. academic standards for student participation in intercollegiate athletics for Division III members. The N.C.A.A. should either require national academic standards for participating in Division III athletics that should be higher than Division I’s and call it Division IIIA,  or require institutions that ask their athletes to have only high school diplomas to create a Division IIIF. This nomenclature should make clear the missions of the divisions and the athletic philosophies of their members. Dennis D. Hunt Evanston, Ill. Little League Overkill To the Sports Editor: Re “Glimpses of Greatness in Sturdy Arm of Teenager,” Feb. 11: In a high school tournament in Japan, Daisuke Matsuzaka threw 250 pitches in one game, then pitched the next two days. As a Little League coach, I think that forcing a young man to pitch so much is nothing less than abuse. Little League has imposed a pitch count on its players beginning this year.  Youngsters do not need to hurt themselves  to be considered dedicated or extraordinary.  James M. McCarthy Rutherford, N.J.
