But at the Richmond County Fair on Staten Island this weekend that old saw will become half true. Canine competitors of varied breeds and sizes will land from above — and shower many drops of water — when Milt Wilcox brings his Ultimate Air Dogs event to the fair. In 2005 Mr. Wilcox, a former pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, inspired by Purina’s Incredible Dog Challenge and his own leap-loving Labrador retriever, started this water sports organization. The contests include Ultimate Air, or distance jumping, in which dogs run the length of a dock, leaping into a pool (the record jump from the short dock that Mr. Wilcox will install at the fair is 21 feet 7 inches); Catch It, above right, in which dogs try to capture a thrown object before splashing down; and Snatch It, a basic swim race. “The dogs start at the end of the dock, jump in and swim to the end of the pool,” Mr. Wilcox said. “The first one touching the toy at the end of the pool wins.” (Just imagine Michael Phelps with bigger ears and much more hair.)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The dog competitions replace the fair’s pig races, which organizers discontinued because of concerns over swine flu, said Ed Wiseman, executive director of Historic Richmond Town, the fair’s site. But the dogs won’t be the only animals attending. The festival also offers pony rides, and the Metropolitan Herpetological Society will bring reptiles, though none are reported to be athletes.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Children can enjoy their own sports. Because Historic Richmond Town aims to recreate Staten Island’s past from the 1600s to the present, many of those games will have an old-fashioned flavor, like three-legged and potato-sack races. Eating contests — hot dog and pie — will be held daily, and Phydeaux’s Flying Flea Circus & Wahoo Medicine Show will evoke classic 1800s charlatanism. Other entertainment includes puppetry, more than 20 bands, a giant mystery sand creation to be sculptured by the artist Matt Long (children can make their own) and illusionists’ shows. “We’re trying to offer more family-oriented, David Blaine -type street magic,” Mr. Wiseman said. “It’s not all fixed entertainment. Sometimes the entertainment will find you.” (Saturday through Monday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., 441 Clarke Avenue, at Arthur Kill Road, Richmond Town, 718-351-1611, historicrichmondtown.org ; $15; $10 for 65+; free for children under 30 inches tall.) LAUREL GRAEBER For Children  ‘A-Maze-Ing Water’ (Friday through Thursday) It’s easy to take water for granted, but this new exhibition at the New York Aquarium shows how often this vital resource can be wasted or polluted. “Water’s Extreme Journey,” the show’s centerpiece, consists of a 1,500-square-foot interactive maze in which children can investigate a model of a watershed and see how contaminants affect the drinking supply; put together puzzles about the water cycle; ride a zipline through pollutants; and discover the diversity of marine life. (Through Sept. 9.) Hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. this Friday; to 7 p.m. this Saturday through Monday; to 5 p.m. this Tuesday through Thursday; Surf Avenue and West Eighth Street, Coney Island, Brooklyn, (718) 265-3474, nyaquarium.com . Free with admission: $14.95; $11.95 for 65+; $10.95 for ages 3 to 12; free for under 3 and members; pay what you wish on Fridays after 3 p.m. ‘Angelina Ballerina the Musical’ (Sunday) That winsome white mouse who does all her scurrying in toeshoes is still dancing. Vital Theater Company’s musical adaptation draws on the books by Katharine Holabird and Helen Craig and the PBS series “Angelina Ballerina the Next Steps.” The show, by Susan DiLallo and Ben Morss, features Angelina and her fellow students doing modern dance, the Irish jig and hip-hop, as well as ballet. (Through Sept. 16.) At 1 p.m., Riverside Theater, 91 Claremont Avenue, at 120th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 579-0528, vitaltheatre.org ; $29.50; $49.50 for premium seats. ‘Animation’ (Friday through Sunday) There’s a lot of science in the creation of cartoons, as young visitors will see in this exhibition. Comprising a cartoon museum, a screening room, a studio and several thematic sections, the 6,000-square-foot show, closing this weekend at the New York Hall of Science, allows children to explore animation techniques while learning how math and physics help foster visual effects. Characters and series from Cartoon Network illustrate the principles investigated. Museum hours: Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 699-0005, nysci.org .

Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show, for ages 3 to 10, also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. From 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8 p.m. on Thursdays; 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org . Free with admission: $12; $10 for 65+; $7.50 for students; free for under 12 and members.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ‘Art Forms: 75 Years of Arts Education’ (Friday through Monday, and Wednesday and Thursday) Few children’s museums have permanent collections, and even fewer have holdings like those of the Children’s Museum of the Arts: young people’s own creations, dating back to the 1930s. This new exhibition showcases 30 examples of art made in previous eras by students of noted educators like Leon Bibel, a painter in the Works Progress Administration; the theorist Henry Schaefer-Simmern; and Sona Kludjian, who taught at a performing and visual arts school in Harlem. Their pupils’ art is shown along with works by contemporary students in 18 public schools who have participated in the museum’s programs. (Through Sept. 30.) Museum hours: Mondays and Wednesdays from noon to 5 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays from noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 103 Charlton Street, between Hudson and Greenwich Streets, South Village, (212) 274-0986, cmany.org . Free with museum admission: $10 this Friday; $11 this Saturday, when a fee increase goes into effect; free for 65+, under 1 and members; pay as you wish on Thursdays from 4 to 6 p.m. Back to School Jam (Friday) A new school year is exciting, especially when it’s the first one. The Brooklyn Children’s Museum invites both new pupils and returning ones to this celebration, which revolves around the theme of street games, even though the fun is indoors. The party will also include crafts, music and a fashion show from Stork, a Brooklyn children’s store. From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., 145 Brooklyn Avenue, at St. Marks Avenue, Crown Heights, (718) 735-4400, brooklynkids.org . Free with admission: $7.50; free for members and under 1. Backstage Tours at ‘The Fantasticks’ (Friday through Sunday, and Monday through Wednesday) The producers of “The Fantasticks” think it’s time to introduce the next generation of theatergoers to their show, the longest-running musical in the world. They have initiated a program for young audiences that will take them behind the scenes after performances, where they can tour the backstage area, meet cast members (Aaron Carter and John Davidson are both in it), learn how the show is put on and take pictures. And, of course, have their first experience with Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt’s fable about love. Performances are Monday, Tuesday and Friday at 8 p.m.; Wednesday at 2 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Jerry Orbach Theater, Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-7862, fantasticksonbroadway.com .

In Family Matters, the Musical’ (Saturday and Sunday) The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are now onstage in an open-ended run of this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children’s book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it’s rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday at 11 a.m.; Sunday at noon (sold out) and 2 p.m.; Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 10 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com ; $34.95 to $59.95. (The most expensive tickets include wearable bear ears and foot-of-the-stage seating.) Children’s Museum of the Arts Free Art Island Outpost (Saturday and Sunday) This island fun doesn’t require a flight to distant shores. The Children’s Museum of the Arts is offering another summer of weekend workshops on Governors Island, which explore a variety of crafts and materials. Each weekend (through Sept. 23) includes organic art making, using resources children find on the island itself, in Building 14; and media lab arts, with activities like filmmaking, sound-music production, animation and puppetry, in Building 11. (More workshops will also take place on Saturday and Sunday in the museum itself; details are on the Web site.) From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Nolan Park, Governors Island, (212) 274-0986, cmany.org , govisland.com ; free. ‘The Edible Garden’ (Friday through Thursday) Children can dig into the Ruth Rea Howell Family Garden — and its succulent harvests — in the “Edible Garden” program at the New York Botanical Garden, which draws on the talents of the chef Mario Batali. Young visitors can explore Mario Batali’s Kitchen Gardens, plots of vegetables and fruits chosen by Mr. Batali (including the Otto pizza garden), while searching for missing ingredients in Mario’s Menu Mystery scavenger hunt. On Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 and 4 p.m., the garden also offers family cooking demonstrations in the Whole Foods Market Family Garden Kitchen. Activities run through October from 1:30 to 5:30 p.m., Bronx River Parkway, Exit 7W, and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8777, nybg.org . Free with grounds-only admission: $10; $5 for students and 65+; $2 for ages 2 to 12; free for under 2 and members. Field Station: Dinosaurs (Friday through Tuesday) It’s not unusual to go see giants in the Meadowlands, but those attracting visitors to that area of New Jersey this summer don’t wear helmets or play football. Field Station: Dinosaurs is a 20-acre park filled with more than 30 animatronic prehistoric creatures, including a Tyrannosaurus rex, a stegosaurus and a 90-foot-long argentinosaurus. Saturday through Monday the “Dinosaur Blitz” event will celebrate those human Giants, too — and other teams — with special activities to celebrate the start of the football season. They will include “What Color Is Your Dinosaur?,” about N.F.L. team colors and the role of coloration in the prehistoric world; “The T-Rex Games,” based on football training exercises; and “Dig Deeper,” discussions with paleontologists about how dinosaurs adapted to their environment by developing some of the same traits valued in pro football players. (Through Nov. 11.) From 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., One Dinosaur Way (off Exit 15X of the New Jersey Turnpike), Laurel Hill Park, Secaucus, N.J., (855) 999-9010, fieldstationdinosaurs.com . In advance, $20; $17.50 for 65+ and ages 3 to 12. At the box office, $25 and $20. Free for 2 and under. ‘Flying Monsters 3D’ (Friday through Thursday) This sounds like the perfect contemporary scary film, except that these monsters didn’t come from a folk tale or a horror writer’s imagination: They were living, breathing realities millions of years ago. Written and narrated by David Attenborough, this new giant-screen 3-D film from National Geographic explores the world of pterosaurs: flying reptiles like the quetzalcoatlus, which was the size of a jumbo jetliner, and the tapejara, which had a sailboat-shaped head. Scientists will discuss their fossils, while the 3-D re-creations swoop at you from the screen. Hourly, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5200, amnh.org . Included in Museum Plus One admission (general admission and one IMAX film or special exhibition): $25; $19 for students and 65+; $14.50 for ages 2 to 12. Member tickets: $12.50; $8 for children.

The stars are the members of the Yang family: Fan and Ana Yang and their son Deni and others, who rotate as M.C.’s for the production. Audience members may even find themselves in bubbles of their own. (The run is open-ended.)

Hidden Harbor Tours: Brooklyn (Tuesday) Everyone sees ships in New York Harbor, but what do they really do? The two-hour Hidden Harbor Tours from Circle Line Downtown take families on a luxury yacht, the Zephyr, to see how nonluxury vessels figure in trade, bringing in goods from abroad destined for store shelves. This tour travels up the East River to the former Brooklyn Navy Yard, the home port of the Fire Department’s fireboat division. It then continues south along the Brooklyn waterfront, past the Red Hook Container Terminal and numerous barges and tugs before making a brief stop at the Statue of Liberty. From 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. (boarding is 15 minutes before departure), Pier 16, 89 South Street, near Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 742-1969, circlelinedowntown.com/tours/hidden-harbors ; $29; $22 for ages 65+ and members of Channel Thirteen, the South Street Seaport Museum and the Working Harbor Committee; $15 for ages 3 through 12; free for under 3. A family four-pack for two adults and two children or one adult and three children is available via telephone order for $53. ‘House of Ghostly Haunts’ (Tuesday) Children old enough to appreciate a few chills along with their chuckles can look forward to the return of Cardone the Vaudeville Magician, who is starting another run of shows at Canal Park Playhouse. In his “House of Ghostly Haunts” Cardone specializes in illusions like swallowing razor blades, dropping guillotines and conjuring the spirit of Elvis. The show admits no one younger than 7; the last 10 minutes unfold in complete darkness. (Through Dec. 18.) At 7 p.m., 508 Canal Street, near Greenwich Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, canalparkplayhouse.com ; $20; dinner from the theater’s Waffle Iron Café is also available before or after the show. ‘The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe’ (Saturday) If the children of the Pevensie family could travel to the magical land of Narnia through something as simple as a wardrobe, why shouldn’t two hard-working actors be able to play them and all the characters found there? That’s what Catherine Fowles and Robert Gilbert are attempting in Off Broadway Family Theater’s first production, le Clanché du Rand’s adaptation of C.S. Lewis’s classic novel. (The run is open-ended.) Saturdays at 11 a.m., St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, narniaoffbroadway.com ; $35.

This is the last day to experience this interactive space at MoMA, which invites families to explore a wide range of mediums that are reflected in the museum’s collection. The stations in the Material Lab include a drawing table; a collage table; Discovery Boxes, with surprise materials within; Cornell Boxes, filled with found objects, in the spirit of the work of Joseph Cornell; and a digital painting area using new technology from Microsoft.

The interactive show, inspired by the Chinese epic “The Journey to the West,” recreates many of the Monkey’s adventures, like fighting the Bull Demon at a station that resembles a video game. Much of the fun teaches Chinese values: cooperation, perseverance, bravery and self-sacrifice. (Through May.) Hours through Oct. 8, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; to 7 p.m. on Saturdays. Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1223, cmom.org .

In this new program at the Audubon Center in Prospect Park, a naturalist will lead children to places where they can play games that relate to the local flora and fauna, whether it’s animal charades or imitating a bat chasing a moth. Sundays also offer a Discover Tour in which families take a walk to look for animals and observe their habitats. “Nature on the Go” from 1 to 2 p.m.; Discover Tours at 3 p.m.; Audubon Center, Prospect Park, near the Lincoln Road and Ocean Avenue entrance, Brooklyn, (718) 287-3400, prospectpark.org/audubon ; free. New Museum First Saturday for Families: New Optics (Saturday) Paintings can make you see a lot, including, sometimes, things that aren’t there. In conjunction with the New Museum’s exhibition “Ghosts in the Machine,” children will explore the work of the artists Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely, who employ repeating shapes, lines and colors to create the impression of depth and movement. Working with museum educators, young visitors will devise their own optical illusions. From 10 a.m. to noon, 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org ; free, but limited tickets available first come first served.

They will demonstrate their skills at this three-day extravaganza, which includes a long-distance trip across Brooklyn, from 2 to 6:30 p.m. on Friday, followed by festivities and fireworks at Coney Island. But the main event is on Saturday and Sunday on Governors Island, where the festival will offer races and demonstrations of all kinds of feats and games, including unicycle basketball, unicycle hockey and a challenging course for “extreme riders.” Visitors can try unicycling too.

These days the Brooklyn Children’s Museum is providing the flowing capes, the wands and lots of instruction. Best of all, the magic is real.
