When no one else wanted power plants, Astoria said yes, and it now provides 60 percent of the city's energy. When Manhattan banned graveyards, Queens became the Borough of Cemeteries. When no one else wanted airplanes buzzing overhead, New York built an airport in Flushing. Then it built another in Jamaica. When New York wanted a World's Fair, the city spent 50 years, from 1889 to 1939, holding out for a location in Manhattan, without success. Finally, the city settled on Flushing Meadows and won the fair, which returned in 1964. And so yesterday, a day after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced that Queens would be the fallback site for the city's Olympics bid -- his Manhattan dream having crashed and burned -- few people in the Borough of Fallbacks were shocked. Once again, New York's utility borough would pick up after Manhattan, repairing what needed to be fixed, bearing the burden of the city's, and the nation's, Olympic hopes for 2012. "They can't live without Queens," said Gene Carballo, a retired sanitation worker who was playing cards yesterday at an Italian men's club in Corona. "The mayor wants it over there. He can't get it over there, so Queens is his second choice."   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The mayor did not exactly deny that. To the contrary, at certain points in his announcement he sounded as if he was trying to wound the borough's pride.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       "It's not our first choice, but it's an awful good alternative," Mayor Bloomberg said at a news conference on Sunday, announcing Olympics 2012, Plan B. If the message was not clear, he also said, "Our first best choice didn't work." Though the mayor's remarks landed like a slap in some quarters, they reflected the political reality of the Olympic campaign's history. Long ago, Shea Stadium was good enough for the Beatles and the Miracle Mets, but this year the mayor has derided it as lacking grandeur, unable to attract corporate box suites or the attention of international athletes. "The mayor is not a politician," said Claire Shulman, the former Queens borough president. "Otherwise he would have been more gentle in his description of this borough." Choice of words aside, Mrs. Shulman said she was not surprised at the Olympics boosters' reluctant acceptance of the borough. Three decades in local politics left her with vivid memories of tiny daggers. There was the time she considered putting up a fake "Great Neck" sign at a Queens station on the Long Island Rail Road, on the theory that railroad officials would pay more attention to cleanliness if they believed they were in Nassau County. There were campaigns for improvements to the Van Wyck Expressway; there was a pitched battle for a swimming pool at Long Island City High School. "I had to beg and practically cry," Mrs. Shulman said. "Manhattan comes first, and whatever else, you can split up among the other boroughs." Beyond the small stuff, the list of snubs starts to get embarrassing. The United Nations fled long ago. The Jets football team has steadfastly refused to return to Queens, even though the place it would be returning from is New Jersey. And last summer, protesters against the Republican National Convention refused to hold a march in Queens.

When Eddie Murphy played an African prince seeking a suitable American bride, he came to Queens only by a misunderstanding. When a character in "Quiz Show" suggested that people would root for an underdog from Queens as a "New York thing," another shot back: "Queens is not New York." With the burden of all that history as a backdrop, the people of Queens were taking this latest request from the mayor, prominent Manhattan resident he, with what might be described as grumpy stoicism.

"There's a lot of people who start in Manhattan, move to Brooklyn, can't afford Brooklyn and finally end up in Jackson Heights," said Mr. Matlaga, who, for his part, is still hanging on to an apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, commuting to his job in Queens. Alex Andres, 38, who works at New York Hospital and lives in Elmhurst, took heart in the surmise that every big city has its Queens. "It's like that with any metropolitan area; the heart is the center of attention and the rest is the supporting cast," Mr. Andres said. "The World's Fair didn't change it, the tennis stadium didn't change it, Shea Stadium didn't change it and the Olympics won't. It's the way it is." As if to reinforce the borough's most frequent selling points -- diversity, food and diversity of food -- Mr. Andres was sitting near the boccie court in William F. Moore Park with an orange treat from the Lemon Ice King of Corona, one of the borough's more storied small-time institutions. Feeling inspired, he rushed to Queens's defense, drawing in allegory on short notice. "You could try to run a ship with a captain," Mr. Andres said, "but unless it has the sails, it won't go anywhere." Marjorie Sweeney, who works in public relations for the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, portrayed second choice as a good thing.

Back at the social club in Corona, Mr. Carballo was having none of this business about the good side of second choice. "If you don't come in first, you come in dead last," Mr. Carballo said. "It's like a horse race; if you finish by a nose it's terrible." Mr. Carballo added that Manhattan would always need Queens for its work force, speaking from experience as a retired city worker. Then he got up from his card game and looked out the glass door onto 51st Avenue. There was once last thing to say, before another hand of poker with a lot of old men: To some hearts, Queens is first choice for reasons Manhattan cannot hope to change. "You can have true friends over here," Mr. Carballo said, "not fly-by-nights."  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
