From the wooden cross that the nobleman, Pedro Alvares Cabral, erected a few days later at Porto Seguro (safe harbor) small Portuguese villages soon grew -- humble stucco cottages dominated by whitewashed churches. But in subsequent decades Portugal's vast South Atlantic colony grew in other directions, and Brazil's Plymouth Rock lapsed into tropical neglect. Principal access to Porto Seguro, 110 miles south of Ilheus, continued to be by sea until 1972, the year a paved road was pushed through to the coast. When pioneering tourists -- largely Brazilian and European hippies -- ventured to Trancoso, a neighboring village, they introduced a money economy to a community that had long since reverted to barter. Today scheduled airlines bring in tourists daily from Brazil's largest cities. The country's most popular tourist destination in the northeast after Salvador and Recife, Porto Seguro, which has a population of about 5,000, offers comfortable hotels and excellent seafood restaurants in a setting of primeval beauty that struck Portuguese explorers almost 500 years ago.

Zoning laws are zealously enforced to preserve beaches and historic buildings, some of which rank among the oldest in South America. Indeed, much of the coast of southern Bahia State is still wilderness.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Modern American visitors too will feel a sense of discovery here. While Brazilian guidebooks list as many as 100 hotels and guesthouses in Porto Seguro and the neighboring villages of Trancoso and Arraial d'Ajuda, English-language guidebooks devote relatively little space to this remote corner of southern Bahia State. When Americans think of vacationing on Brazilian beaches, they think of Copacabana and Ipanema in Rio de Janeiro. When Rio residents think of vacationing on Brazilian beaches, they head for Porto Seguro. "Less than 1 percent of our tourists are foreigners," said Cicero G. de Sena Neto, former director of the local trade association and now manager of the Portobello Praia Hotel, one of Porto Seguro's top four hotels. For visitors strolling the cobblestone streets, shaded by breadfruit and weeping fig trees, Porto Seguro offers a spirit that is fading from Brazil's coastal megapolises -- honesty, amiability and a guileless smile. As tourism has grown in recent years, Porto Seguro has also won a niche in Brazilian mythology for string bikini sensuality and bronzed beach athletics. The town's two international exports reflect this: a world windsurfing champion and the sensuous dance called the lambada. Because seasons are reversed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, Americans can visit Porto Seguro in the off season, March through June and August through November. During Brazil's summer, December through February, and during winter break in July, the fishing villages can become so crowded that they take on the air of a Brazilian Fort Lauderdale. But off season, prices are lower, restaurants and hotels are less crowded and the local people are more patient with tourists who do not speak Portuguese. Our trip last June started from Rio's downtown Santos Dumont airport. Shortly after taking off in a 14-seater plane of Nordeste Airlines, the pilot pointed north and the co-pilot settled into reading the sports section of a newspaper. Passengers watched the changing coastline below -- the salt flats of Cabo Frio, the yachts and turquoise-green swimming pools of Buzios and the eucalyptus plantations of Espirito Santo. We stopped to refuel at a southern Bahian town named, appropriately, Caravelas. For scuba divers, Caravelas is now the jumping-off point for boat tours of the Abrolhos National Marine Park, an uninhabited archipelago 40 miles offshore. From Porto Seguro airport, it was a 10-minute taxi ride to our hotel, the Portobello Praia. Porto Seguro has several car rental agencies, but with driving reduced to one beach road, we found it simpler to have the hotel receptionist telephone for cabs. The hotel, reflecting local taste and zoning restrictions, is a Mediterranean-style two-story building with a decor of natural materials -- black wood trim, beige roofing tiles and red hibiscus blooms brushing against whitewashed walls. Crossing the coast road to Itaperapua beach, a two-minute walk, one appreciated the zealousness of Porto Seguro's Green Party. Viewed from the water's edge, the beach road and the low, setback hotel disappeared behind a long line of native vegetation, largely coconut palms. A series of immaculate beaches and coves runs for roughly 10 miles along the beach drive, protected by offshore reefs and affording good swimming. The only signs of man on Porto Seguro's beaches were palhocas, wooden restaurant-bars with round thatched roofs. At Boto's, the inescapable lambada music blasted from loudspeakers as beachgoers snacked on fried shrimp and sipped batidas de coco, stiff iced drinks of half coconut milk and half locally distilled sugar cane rum.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Lambada is the theme that links the scattered villages of southern Bahia's coast. By Porto Seguro's docks, a few yards from one of two competing crosses that supposedly mark the site of the first Roman Catholic Mass in Brazil, a sandy lane named Discovery Avenue now houses a string of open-air lambaterias. There, tourists from southern Brazil pay loose-hipped dance instructors to discover that they are stiff-jointed. IN 1988 a French entrepreneur, Olivier Lamotte d'Incamps, visited Porto Seguro and discovered locals dancing the tightly syncopated lambada to a melody that turned out to be Bolivian. With a blitz of publicity, Mr. Lamotte d'Incamps launched the lambada craze, largely by promoting a European tour of Kaoma, a Porto Seguro dance group. Forgettable movies followed. The lambada meteor eventually crashed , but only after Kaoma sold over seven million records. Down on Discovery Avenue, local teen-agers dance on, dreaming of making it in groups that still tour Brazil under names like "Do Do From Bahia and the Virgins From Porto Seguro." For more highbrow entertainment, a hike up a nearby bluff takes a visitor to the colonial heart of Porto Seguro. Declared a National Historic and Artistic Monument in 1973 and closed to cars old Porto Seguro includes Our Lady of Mercy Church (1523), reputedly Brazil's oldest church still in use, Our Lady of the Blacks, built by and for African slaves, and a white and mustard-trim town council house and jail whose Baroque style has survived untouched since construction in 1772. Set against a sweeping view of the sea, a roughly hewn white marble marker bears the arms of Portugal and the cross of Prince Henry the Navigator. Erected in 1503, the marker is generally considered Brazil's oldest surviving colonial monument. Every April 22 Portuguese diplomats gather here to celebrate Discovery Day. As Porto Seguro has blossomed into a full-fledged resort, the diplomats' interest in fulfilling this official chore has grown. Descending a cobblestone lane, one arrives at Porto Seguro's main oceanfront street, Avenida Portugal. Nicknamed Passarela do Alcool, literally Alcohol Alley, the street is lined with sidewalk cafes, stand-up bars, resort-style pizzerias, handcraft boutiques and seafood restaurants. All are housed in the traditional one-story fishermen's cottages, with pastel stucco facades. Items for sale include hand-embroidered cotton tablecloths, painted clay figurines from the rural Northeast and baskets woven locally from white creeper vines. On the Passarela, Tres Vintens offers rich Afro-Brazilian seafood dishes bubbling hot in earthenware pots. The 1970's decor -- geometric designs by Max Escher -- can seem overwhelming after a few batidas of coconut milk or passion fruit juice. Nearby, Ilha do Mel (Honey Island) offers Charles Aznavour music while waiters serve slices of California pizza (topped with peaches and figs) and glasses of draft beer chilled to what Brazilians call "stupefyingly cold." For dessert, an espresso bar next door serves chilled slices of lime pie and ricotta pie.

With one of Brazil's richest fishing grounds offshore, Porto Seguro fishermen bring home varied catches: shrimp, octopus, mullet, snook, sea bass, red snapper, swordfish, mackerel, anchovies and flatfish. For excursions out of Porto Seguro, the paved beach road continues 15 miles north to Santa Cruz de Cabralia, a colonial-era village named in honor of the Portuguese explorer. Along the way, it is not worth stopping at Ponta da Coroa Vermelha (Red Reef Point), where there is a brazilwood cross marking another reputed site of the first Mass in Brazil. The site is surrounded by a Pataxos Indian community.  Today's Pataxos dress up as Indians and jog alongside tourists' cars, peddling neo-Pataxos trinkets and tomahawks. Cabralia, the northern terminus of the beach drive, offers a hilltop colonial church and an embarkation point for schooner tours of offshore reefs. We set off for a day tour in the Luanda, a schooner that takes tourists cruising; it is owned by a Portuguese who fled Angola after colonial rule collapsed there. With the inescapable lambada medleys wafting over the waters, the blue and white trim Luanda glided past mangrove swamps until anchoring at Coroa Alta reef. With sneakers protecting their feet, passengers spent the morning clambering over the milelong coral reef, inspecting pools where luminiscent fish were trapped by tides in temporary tropical aquariums. On high ground, two men sold chilled coconuts for 75 cents apiece to the thirsty amateur naturalists.

Boat tours also head south for the less-visited beaches of Arraial d'Ajuda and Trancoso. But these beaches are generally unprotected by coral reefs and the ride is in the rough open sea. An alternative is to go to the ferry dock in Porto Seguro and cross the Buranhem River in a 15-minute ferry ride (40 cents). On the other side, a city bus will lurch over a pitted dirt road to Arraial (15 minutes) and on to Trancoso (another 45 minutes; $1.20). The road to Trancoso is so bad that it is usually impassable after heavy rains. Arraial's church dates back to 1549. Trancoso's church is comparatively modern, dating only to 1656 -- 36 years after the first English settlement in Plymouth Rock.
