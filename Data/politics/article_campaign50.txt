Credit Joshua Roberts/Reuters     Earlier this month, Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House and a presidential candidate in 2012, released a set of recommendations for Republicans running for election this year. Gingrich put together the 22-page manifesto, “ 2016 Election Principles ,” at the request of the Republican National Committee. The document — in essence a master plan that comes with the strong endorsement of Reince Priebus, the chairman of the R.N.C. — stresses the need for “widespread inclusion of ethnic groups.” It sounds remarkably like an across-the-board renunciation of Donald Trump’s campaign strategy. This presents something of a paradox, though, because Gingrich claims to be one of Trump’s strongest supporters. In March, well before it was clear that Trump would go on to win the nomination, Gingrich told Slate that Trump has had the nerve to raise questions in a clear language because he represents the millions of Americans who are sick and tired of being told that they have to be guilt-ridden and keep their mouth shut. Since then, Gingrich has made it official, telling Fox News’s Sean Hannity on May 11 : Let me start by saying that, clearly, to anybody who’s watched, you know, I endorse Donald Trump. I’m going to work very hard for the Republican nominee. Given the fact that it would be hard to imagine an approach to campaigning more diametrically opposed to Gingrich’s plan than what Trump has done so far, Gingrich’s enthusiasm for Trump appears almost inexplicable.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       But Trump won the Republican presidential nomination by appealing specifically to just those voters most opposed to “widespread inclusion of ethnic groups.” His core support in primary after primary has been white voters who rank highest on scales of ethnocentrism and racial resentment . Trump, the very antithesis of inclusivity, has also raised the level of hostility to his campaign among women, African-Americans and other minorities to record highs. The conservative Washington Times reported on April 21 that Trump “has a staggering 87 percent unfavorable rating” among Latinos, and “in a head-to-head matchup with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump loses the Hispanic vote 76-11.” According to Gallup , Trump’s unfavorable rating among women is 70 percent. Trump’s alienation of minority voters — 86 percent of African-Americans view him unfavorably — means that in order to win, he has to match or exceed Ronald Reagan’s 66 percent of the white vote in 1984. Given Trump’s 68 percent unfavorability rating among white women, he would have to win 70 percent of the votes cast by white men. In the R.N.C. document, Gingrich fails to reconcile his inclusive strategy with Trump’s focus on driving up conservative white support by demonizing minority voters. Without referring to Trump’s “ white power ” strategy, Gingrich asserts that in every campaign we studied, there was a direct correlation between paying attention to minority communities, events, activities and key dates and the increase in votes. Gingrich singles out the example of the Colorado senator Cory Gardner’s election in 2014: Gardner went from between 6 and 8 percent support among Colorado’s Latino voters in January to tying incumbent Senator Udall at 48-48 on Election Day. Colorado Republicans worked Pueblo, a largely Hispanic area they had traditionally ignored and which now has a Republican Latina state legislator and boosted Gardner’s vote above the historic pattern. In the case of women, Gingrich writes, Gardner seized the initiative and defined women’s health on his terms before the left could push him into a ‘War on Women’ defensive position. Gingrich argues that the goal has to be inclusion, not outreach. Outreach is when the old order makes a decision and then calls the community leaders to inform them. Inclusion is when the community is in on the discussion before the decision. Republicans, in Gingrich’s analysis, have the opportunity to perform better among single women, younger voters, Asians, Hispanics, and African-Americans. The Gingrich document pointedly ignores the crucial issue facing his party this year: How do Republican candidates deal with the controversies raised by their presidential nominee? Nor does Gingrich explain how he could endorse Trump when Trump’s electioneering approach runs counter to the strategy Gingrich believes is essential for Republican success. Gingrich’s stance is striking because it is obvious that Republican candidates are going to be under pressure — at meetings with voters, at news conferences and during door-to-door canvasing — to respond to voters who ask, “Do you agree with Donald Trump’s latest statement about (insert women, Muslims, immigrants here)?”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Why does Gingrich think he and his party can skate over his core disagreements with Trump? The answer is provocative and illuminating. Gingrich is convinced that there has been a weakening of the Democratic Party over the last eight years at the state and local level — including in key battleground states — which has left a door open for a broad Republican victory this November. Gingrich bases his argument on the following data. According to the average of the first five Gallup polls in early 2009, when Barack Obama took office, 51.8 percent of voters identified with the Democratic Party and 38.4 percent with the Republican Party, a solid 13.4 point Democratic advantage. In 2016, however, the average of the first five polls shows that the Democratic advantage has shrunk to a far more modest 5.2 point edge, with 47.2 percent of voters identifying as Democrats and 42 percent identifying as Republicans. This translates to a Democratic loss in voter identification, over the past seven-and-a-half years, of 8.2 percentage points — a political bloodletting. Then take three battleground states: Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. In 2008 , Gallup found partisan advantages favoring Democrats in these states by 18, 16 and 9 points respectively. But in 2015 , the most recent year for which Gallup state data is available, the Democratic advantages had virtually disappeared in two of the three states, falling to 0.2 points in Ohio and to 0.7 points in Florida. In Pennsylvania, the 16 point Democratic advantage fell to 3 points. Last week, Quinnipiac provided further evidence of increased Democratic liability in these three states, with polls showing Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton in Ohio by 4 points and just one point behind her in both Florida and Pennsylvania. These Gallup findings favoring the Republican Party appear to work against demographic changes pushing the electorate in the opposite direction. E very four years , voters in presidential elections become roughly 2 percent less white and 2 percent more minority, primarily Hispanic, Asian and black. These diverse voters support Democrats by large margins. The death of older voters, the most Republican of all whites, also drives the decline of the white demographic. I asked Charles Stewart, a political scientist at M.I.T., about conflicting currents in the electorate.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Stewart wrote back: Bottom line: the demographic trends are glacial, whereas the sorting that’s due to animosity toward Obama has acted more quickly. Stewart went on to elaborate: It’s pretty clear that whites in more conservative areas of the country have moved away from the Democratic Party — at least those who were still Democrats — at a much faster rate than others have moved toward the Democratic Party. In effect, Stewart supports Gingrich’s claim that the Obama years have “done more to grow the Republican Party than any Democratic president in our history.” Gingrich, for his part, argues that pro-Republican trends will have a long-term negative impact on the ability of the Democratic Party to compete in future elections. “Since President Obama’s election in 2008,” Gingrich writes, we have gone from 22 to 31 Republican governors, for a gain of 9; 22 to 32 Republican lieutenant governors, for a gain of 10; and 18 to 27 Republican attorneys general, for a gain of 9. Gingrich then gives the dagger another twist: To get a sense of the depth of the Democratic Party’s decay at the state legislative level in the Obama era, consider that since President Obama took office, 85 of 98 legislative bodies have become more Republican than they were when he was inaugurated. The result, according to Gingrich, has been “the destruction of the Democratic Party’s farm team in the states.” Gingrich is at his best in identifying Democratic vulnerabilities. His 2016 victory plan, however, has a number of weaknesses. First, while the Gallup data supports the Gingrich case that the Democratic Party is weaker than is widely recognized, the most recent findings from Gallup show Republican gains are grinding to a halt.

A detailed analysis that Politico published on Tuesday, however, found that the turnout increase in primaries this year comes not from new Republican voters, but from voters who in the past eschewed state and local races and only cast ballots in the general election. A third vulnerability: Gingrich claims that Republicans are on the cusp of a game-changing “revolution” in microtargeting through the use of a new technology called “Voter Score.” Voter Score is a database that ranks every voter in the nation on a series of 100 point scales for their likelihood of casting Republican or Democratic ballots, their stands on issues and their turnout history. There are indications that Voter Score is not as revolutionary as Gingrich makes it out to be. I sent Gingrich’s description of Voter Score to Laura Quinn, a former Democratic National Committee technology guru who now runs Catalist , a Democratic list management firm. Her response was straightforward: LOL. We have been doing this for a decade. Wow, they have a long way to go. We can show progress far beyond that. Eitan Hersh , a political scientist at Yale who has written a book on political microtargeting, “ Hacking the Electorate ,” raised a number of questions about the value of Voter Score.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   To begin with, Hersh said, Democrats and liberals have been more willing to share key voter lists between candidates, parties and interest groups than Republicans have. He argues that since each user keeps adding new information to the list, the accuracy of the Democratic lists improves. Hersh contends that a crucial factor in the development of microtargeting lists is a large volunteer force constantly going door to door and refining the quality of the list through hand-held devices. In 2004, this worked well for Republicans because conservative and evangelical churches provided a massive base of workers for canvassing. In 2008 and 2012, however, Hersh said, neither John McCain nor Mitt Romney drew much enthusiasm from the Christian right. With fewer volunteers, the lists atrophied. The Obama campaigns of 2008 and 2012, Hersh points out, were swamped with volunteers. So far this year, Trump has shown little interest in building a volunteer-based “ground game,” and without such a network, Hersh suggests, the Republican Voter Score system will not undergo the constant updating required for a high-quality operation. What can we conclude from the pluses and minuses of the Gingrich analysis? To some extent, Gingrich is right. Democrats are arguably too sanguine about the party’s demographic inevitability and its Electoral  College  advantage . That overconfidence may, in turn, lead to strategic errors in targeting states, making ad buys and other key tactical decisions. Meanwhile, NBC’s most recent poll gives Clinton just a three-point lead nationally, 48-45. While Trump brings the risk of implosion to the campaign, with the potential to devastate the Republican Party, he also has the potential to win and to transform American politics for the foreseeable future. The odds favor implosion, but do not preclude the possibility of transformation.   Still, the Trump campaign is (and has been) playing a high-risk game, the opposite of the base-broadening, inclusive strategy Gingrich now calls for. Trump’s presidential campaign will be the ultimate test of whether the Republican Party can survive as the nation’s bastion of revanchism — the party of racial reaction. The very fact that he is still afloat suggests that his backward-looking, white-dependent strategy may be more viable than those on the left, not to mention those on the traditional establishment right, believe.
