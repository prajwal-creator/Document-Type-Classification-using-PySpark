ISEMAN OCT. 6, 2009     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           The baseball playoffs, which start this week, provide the perfect distraction for my 11-year-old son, Alex,  and me. In this year of financial turmoil, swine flu and continuing war casualties abroad, we are eager to follow the race for the pennant. The interleague fall rite will produce some of 2009’s baseball heroes, who will lead their teams to the World Series. A championship that has existed since 1903 through world wars, a boycott and a baseball players’ strike, the Series, between the American and National Leagues, will lift one team to the pinnacle of the sport. Who will prove the winner? Alex and I have been pondering this question. We also talk about the larger issues of heroism: what should constitute a hero in baseball and how such heroes are valued in our society. I used to find all of my heroes in the political realm: Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression ; Winston Churchill in World War II; Lyndon B. Johnson for his war on poverty; the Nobel laureates Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi; and, more recently, President Obama. But Alex has taught me to find heroes at Yankee Stadium . Under his tutelage, I have come to admire the lineup of our home team. Alex, who has passionately followed the Yankees ’ progress since he was 5, has influenced me to see heroes through a pinstripe prism.

Derek Jeter is a hero because his abilities are extraordinary. This talent, of course, was most recently on display when on Sept. 11 he surpassed Lou Gehrig’s record of 2,721 hits as a Yankee.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Gehrig was a class-act team captain, as is Jeter, and a huge hero in our household as well. We revere Gehrig because he demonstrated such strength when he was ill, as did my husband, who died of cancer when Alex was 8. I have tried to explain to Alex that character plays a part, too, in judging a baseball hero. I have shown him the famous video of Gehrig, weak but handsome and full of grace, resigning from baseball in 1939. He tells the rapt audience at the old Yankee Stadium that he is “the luckiest man on the face of the earth,” only to live just two more years.

I have tried to impart the message to my son that a player’s merit should not be measured solely by runs batted in  or other statistics. Leadership, admirable comportment on the field, humility  — all are elements that make a genuine hero. For Alex and me, our focus in the playoffs is unabashedly on the American League, as we gauge the odds of a Yankees’ win and imagine different situations, depending on the opposing teams. Alex has a firm grasp of possible outcomes, while I remain essentially in the dark. Phrases like defensive indifference, a scoring decision in which the defense ignores a player attempting to steal, thus depriving the runner of credit for the theft, no longer intimidate me. But as a baseball mother arriviste, they leave me perplexed. Despite my ignorance, I, like millions of other fans, will be swept up in the playoff fervor. Swayed by my son’s unflagging faith, my vision is that the Yankees will win the American League pennant, not accomplished since 2003, and ultimately triumph in the World Series, a victory that last occurred in 2000. In our imagination, World Series heroes they will be again, a rare feat in the history of baseball for a team with a new stadium. As momentum gathers throughout the month, we hope to get our chance to cheer in the stands at the Series’ final game. The mayor will be present next to the Yankees’ dugout, military planes will swoop over the diamond and the 50,000-strong crowd will roar as each Yankees player steps up to bat. For at least nine innings, we will be able to forget foreclosures and bankruptcies, our friends at home sick with the flu and the many conflicts in the world, and simply revel in the success of our hometown heroes.
