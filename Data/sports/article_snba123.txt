George, chairman of the middle school program at the University of Florida, was ''the Edsel of American education, but for several decades few were aware that it wasn't selling.'' It was intended as a buffer between elementary and high school, a safe haven in which preadolescents, roughly from age 10 to 14, would be protected from the corrupting influence of high schoolers. At the same time, of course, they would presumably not corrupt grade schoolers. In reality, junior high school often became an isolation ward in which preadolescents aped the worst excesses of the high schools, such as obsession with varsity sports, marching bands and partying - as the late James B. Conant pointed out in a 1960 study. Often, these schools were staffed by disgruntled people who really wanted to be high school teachers. In response to these factors, educators then tried to design a new model - the middle school. That experiment is now 20 years old, and is critiqued in the current issue of Principal, the journal of the National Association of Elementary School Principals. The differences between junior high and middle schools are often hard to define. Junior high grades are usually, but not always, the sixth through ninth. Middle school grades are usually, but not always, fifth through eighth. And middle schools are known by different names in various parts of the country (in New York City, for example, they are called intermediate schools).

Junior high students are treated more like high schoolers and their environment is more subject oriented. Middle schools, in theory anyway, are supposed to be more child oriented.

Throughout the first half of the century, the junior high school was touted as revolutionary. By 1960, educators had learned a great deal about preadolescents.  ''To be different at this age is to be doomed,'' one observer said.  Recalling her own experience, Sally Banks Zakariya, editor of The Principal, agrees: ''And different we were, all of us, or feared we were. We were all elbows and egos. We didn't seem to fit in the new school - we were too short, or too tall; we wore the wrong clothes, sang the wrong songs; we were too shy, too fat, too awkward, too pimply. We were, in a word, vulnerable. And nobody seemed to care.'' The middle school was created to be more than a high school prep.  It was to provide a planned transition from childhood to young adulthood, from the protective environment of a good elementary school to the often depersonalized high school. Whatever its success in accomplishing those goals, the middle school's growth has been phenomenal. There were about 500 middle schools in 1965; today there are more than 5,000. That figure may double in 10 years.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

It is ''one of the few humanistic innovations since the progressive education movement - indeed, perhaps the only one - that is still thriving.'' Today's preadolescents are different, says Roger Wall, associate editor of ''The Principal.'' They are physically more mature. Their behavior often veers between insecurity and audacity. Their moods swing wildly. They are argumentative, yet vulnerable. They readily succumb to fads, either to improve their appearance or to make themselves popular with their peers. Spurts of exuberant energy alternate with mournful lassitude. The proponents of the middle school insist that they are designed to respond to these problems. They see these schools as a place for specially-trained teachers to deal, in John Dewey's old phrase, with ''the whole child,'' and not just the mind; institutions where, as Mr. Wall puts it, ''right thinking'' is more important than ''right answers.'' When it comes to specifics, the experts are somewhat vague. They say that in good middle schools, scheduling of academic subjects is more flexible than in high schools where the day is dominated by ''the big four'' - English, social studies, mathematics and science - with a 50-minute period rigidly assigned to each. Ideally, middle school teachers should cooperate, and perhaps even handle a combination of subjects through teaching teams. High school-style athletics are replaced by more relaxed intramurals. In a society driven by competition, says Mr. George, the good middle school lets youngsters seek success and satisfaction without feeling driven.

''I found that elementary teachers are able to identify the needs of middle school students better than the subject-matter specialists you typically find on a high school staff.'' A rigorous academic program is not necessary at this stage, she says. More important is a strong foundation in how to study, how to do research, and how to explore subjects. Much of this is anathema to the growing body of educational conservatives - those who scoff at coddling the delicate psyche of the preadolescent. Even many educators who favor the principle of the middle school criticize it in practice as a mere cosmetic change -a new name for the same old classroom procedures that failed in junior high. Despite such criticism, middle school growth continues. Mr. George says that whatever the movement's eventual fate, 'the focus on this (preadolescent) period of life will continue to sharpen and intensify.
