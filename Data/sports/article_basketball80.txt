Coach Mike Woodson called the absences of Kidd and Chandler “maintenance” days. That is one step above “rest,” which is how the Knicks officially excused Kidd’s sitting out all but five minutes of Sunday night’s game against Atlanta. It was later reported that Kidd had back soreness. With the Knicks facing three games in the next four days, Woodson acknowledged that more rest for Kidd could be the best medicine. Kidd did not speak with the news media Tuesday. “If he tells me, ‘Hey, I need to back off,’ I’m going to back off,” Woodson said. “Jason is a big piece of this puzzle, and I need him when it really counts. That’s coming down the homestretch.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Woodson was more hopeful that Chandler, who has a sore neck, would be available for the Knicks’ game Wednesday against the Orlando Magic at Madison Square Garden, but he said he would not know until game time. Woodson also played down speculation that forward Rasheed Wallace would return to practice this week, saying that both Wallace and center Marcus Camby could be out until after the All-Star break.

Smith and Iman Shumpert soared past his outstretched arms for easy layups. “You can’t be afraid to get into the teeth of the defense,” Woodson said. It was a pick-and-roll exercise. One assistant, Jim Todd, delivered the entry pass. Another, Herb Williams, set the screen. Smith and Shumpert let their intuitive skills figure out the rest. Ideally, it would be Kidd delivering the pass, and Chandler setting the high screen, but the Knicks are coming to grips with the reality that no lineups or roles can be set in stone. Tuesday’s extra workout session for the young and spry Smith and Shumpert seemed geared toward enhancing their roles as key parts in the offense, working off high screens, breaking down the defense. In essence, bolstering their ability to replace whomever, whenever. Beginning with Kidd. “He’s got confidence in us being able to make plays out there, and not just scoring plays,” Smith said. “Make the right pass and try to find other people as well.”  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
