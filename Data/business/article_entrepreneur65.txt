BROWN MARCH 3, 2009     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           How should you fire someone? “It’s perhaps the single most unpleasant task a boss must take care of,” the aptly named Web site howtofiresomeone.com says.  “The mere consideration of it makes your gut clench up, your palms sweat, your head pound. Trepidation courses through your body, making you tense. You snap at your spouse or significant other. You tune out your kids. You pace the floor.” But there are times, like now, that you may have to do it. Experts offer the following advice. YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS Writing on Inc.com ,  Jerry Colonna offers these four suggestions on how  to let someone go. ¶ Be honest. “Sugarcoating the message only ensures that whatever confusion the employee felt in the months leading up to the dismissal will continue,” he writes. “If they are being fired for poor performance, say so. Be as specific as possible and give clear examples. Ideally, you’ll have had many discussions beforehand about performance (although most start-ups rarely can afford this type of investment in management) and you can refer to those discussions.” ¶ Listen. Don’t get defensive. Let the employee talk. You may learn that there are organizational problems that contributed to the employee’s underperformance, if they being fired for cause. Fixing them could improve the company’s performance.

Let them experience the whole range of emotions. Don’t let your fear of their anger force you to cut short their emotional arc. Regardless of their reasons for failure, they are entitled to that.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       ¶ Consider those who are left. Talk to the remaining staff about why the employee was let go. “You can skip details and be discreet about causation.” But do take questions. Employees will want to know if the firing is a sign that the company is in financial trouble and they will want to know who is going to do the fired employee’s work and if more people may  be fired. “Be prepared to answer them all.” BE COMPASSIONATE Treating the person you are firing with respect is simple human courtesy. As Alison Green, writing on USNews.com , says ,  “Even if you’ve been incredibly frustrated with the employee, now that the decision has been made, there’s no reason not to allow yourself to feel and express genuine compassion for what’s inescapably a horrible outcome for the person.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Here’s one of our favorites examples, courtesy of anecdotage.com . “Tired of pounding the pavement in search of a job,” an exercise that was presumably  wearing out his shoes, “an unemployed Bostonian named Humphrey O’Sullivan sat down one day and invented the rubber heel.” And so O’Sullivan Rubber Company was born.
