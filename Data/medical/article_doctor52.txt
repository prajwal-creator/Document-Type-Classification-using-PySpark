He has overseen spending of roughly $20 million (before tax writeoffs) on a world premiere run in Britain and then on an entirely new version of the musical, which opens April 15 on Broadway. He has thrown himself into the role of script doctor, huddling over a laptop the other week with the show’s book writer, James Graham, trying to punch up jokes. He has even fussed over the dog in the cast, pushing for a real-live version instead of an actor. Yet Mr. Weinstein has been more than a hands-on producer. At 63, he has also become a student again, learning the art and craft of making musicals, one of the trickiest entertainment forms to get right. The experience has been both searing and enlightening for him, as he’s gone from rough relationships with his first creative team to a close collaboration with his current one, led by the Tony Award-winning director Diane Paulus . Ask Mr. Weinstein what didn’t work when he started developing the musical, and he is willing to look in the mirror. “I don’t think I worked,” Mr. Weinstein said, in a recent interview, about his feel for theater early on in the show’s history. “I think it was me, more than anything else. If I knew what I know now, four and half years later, we could have done better.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   With preview performances at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater now underway, Mr. Weinstein is not just aiming for better but also best. One frigid afternoon late last month, the “Neverland” cast and creators gathered to test out a restructured opening sequence. The goal was to get to the heart of the musical faster: the emotionally powerful relationship between the main character, the playwright J. M. Barrie, and the four boys and their mother who inspired him to write “Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Weinstein and Ms. Paulus had taken various stabs and were not completely satisfied. But after an hour and a half of rehearsal, the new approach — cutting two songs in order to speed to the momentous first meeting of Barrie and the boys — didn’t feel right. Ms. Paulus hopes to take another crack at it before critics review the show. Hooking the audience with an enthralling opening number is just one of many lessons that Mr. Weinstein has absorbed in reading dozens of books about the theater: The classic opening song “Tradition” was added late to “Fiddler on the Roof,” as was “Comedy Tonight” to “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.” For Mr. Weinstein, whose oversight of his films’ editing is both lauded and notorious, the crossover to the painstakingly slow and wholly unpredictable process of creating musicals has tested both his patience and his decision-making skills. But if “Finding Neverland” has bruised his reputation at times, it’s also been worth it, he says — a passion project that he says often leaves him in tears when the curtain comes down. “You have to make decisions all day long — you have to be supportive,” Mr. Weinstein said in his meeting room in the TriBeCa offices of the Weinstein Company, which includes a treadmill with a phone and movie posters for “Exodus” and “Repulsion” on the walls. “But I have to do the job I’ve been hired for. I have to be the one who does the dirty work — even the dirty work that has nothing to do with me. But that’s my job.” Almost all Broadway producers do dirty work from time to time, no matter if they are courtly or cutthroat (and theater runs the gamut). But they usually deal with problems as quietly as they can — a difficult actor who leaves because of “scheduling conflicts,” an announcement of a show’s close that doesn’t acknowledge lousy ticket sales. “He’s just this giant character who, if he is successful with his show, can only help Broadway,” said Rick Miramontez, a Broadway publicist who quit the “Finding Neverland” account this winter after a clash with Mr. Weinstein (but is still working on one of his films, “The Last Five Years”). “We’re a little provincial, and he can only help change that.” With his early company Miramax, and movies like “Pulp Fiction” and “The Crying Game,” Mr. Weinstein took indies from the art house to the multiplex. A throwback in some ways to the chieftains of the Hollywood studio system, Mr. Weinstein is more than a brilliant marketer. He made (and still makes) movies that at their best are formally and thematically ambitious yet accessible to a large audience.

Mayer, that powerhouse kind of producer,” said Matthew Morrison, who plays Barrie and starred on Fox’s “Glee.”  Photo        Kelsey Grammer during a rehearsal of "Finding Neverland."   Credit Benjamin Norman for The New York Times    Eliot Kennedy, who, with the British pop star Gary Barlow, wrote the music and lyrics for “Finding Neverland,” added: “That sort of slightly tenacious, rambunctious sort of energy he has can come off as a bit aggressive at times. But what you do get is unbridled passion for creativity.” Mr. Weinstein, in turn, has a long history of attracting publicity to his work or himself, by design or by reputation; just last week, for instance, he drew headlines when the police interviewed him over an accusation that he behaved inappropriately with a woman. “We are cooperating fully with the authorities and are confident that we will be fully vindicated,” his spokesman Ken Sunshine said on Monday. No charges have been filed. The voluble Mr. Weinstein sidesteps any psychological probing into whether a desire for a creative challenge drove his decision to become a lead producer on “Finding Neverland” — originally a nonmusical Miramax film starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet — even as he threw himself into salvaging the “New York Spring Spectacular” at Radio City Music Hall for his friend, the sports and entertainment magnate James Dolan. Mr. Weinstein had previously played a supporting role investing in Broadway shows, including “The Producers” and “The Color Purple.” Though entertainment companies are increasingly raiding their libraries to spin off stage shows, and some of the more reliable moneymakers on Broadway are family musicals (like “The Lion King”), Mr. Weinstein surely understands that big payoffs are rare. He decided to turn it into theater because of his children’s love for the movie, he said. Some of the themes in the show — coping with parental death at a young age and embracing the nontraditional family — resonated with him as well. “I wanted just to protect my vision of the show, and so that’s why I said I want more control” of the production process, he said. His controlling impulses caused ill will early on. Mr. Weinstein canceled a tryout production with La Jolla Playhouse in Southern California in 2011, opting for a world premiere instead in 2012 in Leicester, England. During preview performances there, he put pressure on the first director of “Finding Neverland,” Rob Ashford, and the creative team and actors to make changes on the fly, causing anger and resentment, according to five people involved with that production. (Mr. Ashford declined to comment.)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   After Leicester, Mr. Weinstein acknowledged that he had struggled there; the show itself drew mixed reviews from critics , as well as much feedback from friends of Mr. Weinstein like Bono and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Another friend, James Corden, an actor who now hosts “The Late Late Show” on CBS, suggested to Mr. Weinstein that a musical required a hummable song. “I didn’t even know that,” Mr. Weinstein said. “The music that we had was so beautiful, but maybe a little too intellectual for the audience. These guys are terrific. But whatever it was, something didn’t work.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Weinstein jettisoned the two songwriters, as well as Mr. Ashford and the book writer, Allan Knee, whose play “The Man Who Was Peter Pan” was adapted for the movie. The Leicester cast was also dropped. It was a rare instance of an entire production being dumped, at a cost of several million dollars. (The agency of the respected Broadway general manager Nina Lannan also left the show early on.) For all that, Mr. Weinstein was determined not to give up. A new creative team and cast had to be wooed. Ms. Paulus got the invitation to drop by his TriBeCa offices in the spring of 2013 while she was prepping “Pippin” for a Broadway revival. (Mr. Weinstein’s company owns the film rights.) After giving her notes on “Pippin” — including about how to fix what Mr. Weinstein called “the worst ending ever” (she said she implemented many of the suggestions) — he told her he wanted to bring “Finding Neverland” to Broadway, asked her to watch the Depp movie, and gave her a CD with songs that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Kennedy had already written. Next Mr. Weinstein pursued Mr. Morrison, calling him in early 2014 while he was on the set of “Glee.” After several follow-up phone calls and lunch at a swanky Beverly Hills hotel, Mr. Morrison signed on for a developmental workshop of the show that spring. Soon he found himself on the Weinstein payroll, signed to star in one movie, “Tulip Fever,” and provide his voice for the company’s English-language remake of an Argentine animated feature. (With that have come regular invites to industry events and parties, including this year’s Weinstein Company bash held the night before the Oscars, where he and the pop singer Rita Ora performed tunes from “Finding Neverland.”) Mr. Graham, meanwhile, was sought out when his play “This House” drew crowds and critical acclaim in London. He is also writing a movie for Mr. Weinstein.  Photo        Gary Barlow, left, and Matthew Morrison at the Weinstein Company bash held the night before the Oscars.   Credit Charley Gallay/Getty Images for TWC    At last spring’s New York workshop of the retooled show, Mr. Weinstein was self-deprecating before a crowd that included Taylor Swift, the actress Michelle Williams and Mr. Lloyd Webber. “Producing a musical is the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and, those who know, the hardest thing I’ve ever redone,” he said, drawing laughter for his reference to Leicester.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The workshop went well enough that Mr. Weinstein and Ms. Paulus went forward with a production at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., where Ms. Paulus is artistic director. At the opening night party there in August, Mr. Weinstein was by turns complimentary — he called Ms. Paulus “the better version of both” Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese, “and easy to look at” — and swaggering. “I see a lot of Broadway shows and think ‘Yikes.’ To see inventive choreography like ours is so exciting,” he said of the work by Mia Michaels, best known for her work as a judge on “So You Think You Can Dance.” The crowd was full of business titans who don’t usually make it to out-of-town productions. Among them were friends of Mr. Weinstein’s like the billionaire Ronald W. Burkle and Mr. Dolan, who were investors in “Neverland.” When a reporter approached them, they turned away and began talking about which one of them was flying Mr. Weinstein and his team back to New York on their private jets. Next up was Broadway, but not everyone made it there from Cambridge. The star of “Neverland” last summer was the Tony nominee Jeremy Jordan (Mr. Morrison had been unavailable), and Mr. Jordan had hoped to play the role on Broadway, according to friends. But Mr. Weinstein seemed wedded to Mr. Morrison, as were people close to him; his wife, the fashion designer Georgina Chapman, at the opening-night party, said she favored Mr. Morrison because of his sex appeal. Mr. Morrison was again tapped to play Barrie; Mr. Weinstein said he had another project in mind for Mr. Jordan, who also starred in his company’s film “The Last Five Years.” Mr. Weinstein also went through several actors playing the key role of Barrie’s producer, Charles Frohman. Ms. Chapman suggested Kelsey Grammer of “Frasier” fame, and he was successfully recruited. With a move to Broadway in the works, Ms. Paulus and Mr. Weinstein tackled what they felt were the biggest weaknesses, particularly the opening. Instead of a song among Frohman, Barrie and their troupe of actors, the show now opens with Barrie addressing the audience about the story they’re about to hear. “If you frame the show, that epilogue is where we start, and then the whole show is a flashback of how he came to write ‘Peter Pan,’ ” Ms. Paulus said. Mr. Weinstein broke in: “She let me have a rare movie quote,” he said, explaining that he threw so many film references at Ms. Paulus that she parried with a list of theater books to devour. “Billy Wilder opened with narration on almost every movie, because he sets the scene.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Weinstein’s newly bulked-up collaborative muscles were on display during an afternoon rehearsal in mid-March. Sitting in a darkened theater with a laptop-toting Mr. Graham, the two tried to top each other with ever-more snide lines for a scene where the actors in Barrie’s play bad-mouth the playwright behind his back. “Is this funny? Do you like this one? Mr. Graham recalled the two saying to Ms. Paulus, who sat directly in front of them. “Diane would laugh at some and then say, ‘Work harder, boys.’ She’s like Wendy, bossing the lost boys around.” Mr. Weinstein takes great pains to say that he, as a self-described word guy, works with Mr. Graham more than anyone else. While he has Ms. Paulus run every line of the narrative by him, he said she does not need to call him on vocal and choreography matters. “It’s her decision at the end of the day,” Mr. Weinstein said. But that doesn’t mean Mr. Weinstein won’t freely offer his opinions, forcefully, on song lyrics or dance moves or any other aspect of the production. He, as much as Ms. Paulus, if not more, is still pushing to tinker with the first 10 minutes. Last week, the plan called for a new orchestration for the show’s second song. Whether it would satisfy Mr. Weinstein remained to be seen. “He trusts Diane implicitly,” Mr. Kennedy said. “But at the same time, if he feels passionately about something, he’ll hammer it home. He doesn’t stop.” After all, that’s what a Broadway producer does.   Correction: April 12, 2015   An article last Sunday about the new Broadway musical “Finding Neverland” misspelled the given name of the man who wrote “The Man Who Was Peter Pan,” the play on which the musical is based. He is Allan Knee, not Alan.      A version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2015, on Page AR1 of the New York edition with the headline: Alighting on Broadway.
