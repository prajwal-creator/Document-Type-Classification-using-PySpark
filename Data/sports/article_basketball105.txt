Negotiators for the league and the players union were working through the last of the so-called B-list issues on Tuesday. The goal was to have the labor deal ready for ratification by Wednesday, paving the way for training camps and free agency to start Friday. The players will vote first, through an electronic balloting that will begin at 6 p.m. Wednesday and end at 4 p.m. Thursday. The owners are expected to ratify the deal Thursday at a board of governors meeting in New York. The owners will also be voting on a plan to quadruple the league’s revenue-sharing pool. Assuming there are no hiccups along the way, training camps and free agency will open Friday morning. The season will start Dec. 25 with five games on national television.

But coaches are barred from working with players until camps open.

The signing period will begin Friday at a time yet to be determined.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There was a sentiment from some team executives to push back the start of camp because so many teams have incomplete rosters. The Boston Celtics, for example, have six players under contract. The Denver Nuggets and Washington Wizards each have seven. But with so little time to prepare for the season, league officials decided to stick to the schedule it laid out Nov. 26, the day the parties reached agreement. The approval process has had a few bumps already. The union had planned for a Wednesday meeting of its executive board and player representatives in New York to review the full labor deal before sending it to a membership vote. That meeting was canceled in favor of a conference call because most of the players preferred to head straight to their teams rather than spend an extra day traveling. Some teams are holding physical examinations as early as Wednesday.
