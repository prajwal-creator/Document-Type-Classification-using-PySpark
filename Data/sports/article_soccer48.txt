Soccer has been used as a catalyst for the public uprisings against Brazil’s social and economic problems. The billions being spent on stadiums for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games — and the profits that will go out of the country from those events — are clearly a cause of some of the public disaffection. The people do not buy the spurious propaganda that these jamborees are supposed to inspire lasting urban regeneration beyond the lifecycle of the two major coming events. Montreal impoverished  itself to stage the 1976 Summer Games, and South Africa is staring at white elephant stadiums after the 2010 World Cup. Still FIFA, the world soccer authority, claims that the World Cup next year will inject 112.8 billion reais, about $50.6 billion, into the Brazilian economy by 2014, against the cost of putting on the 64 games in the 12 new or enhanced stadiums that were paid for at public expense.

Brazilians might adore their futebol, but in the words of Romário, a grand goal poacher turned congressman, the money spent on the Mané Garrincha stadium in the capital of Brasilia could have been used to build 150,000 houses for low-income families.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Romário is turning into as opportune a politician as he was a player. But it was President Rousseff who gave the speech addressing the protests at the Presidential Palace on Monday. She spoke of the energy that comes from the streets. “The streets are telling us that they want more citizenship, they want full citizenship,” she said. “They are telling us that the country wants quality public services, that they want more efficient mechanisms to fight corruption that ensure proper use of public money.” There were 2,000 words in the presidential address. Soccer and Olympics were not among them. There were pacts to deal with corruption, health reform, public transportation, education and lawlessness. There was a government proposal to use future oil royalties to reverse the century-old delay in the education system and to import doctors from abroad to strengthen health care. Nothing about what role, if any, soccer might play in this rebuilding of the national state. No mention of Neymar, or David Luiz or coach Luiz Felipe Scolari all saying that the players were on the side of the people. “All of us want justice in our country with everything that we imagine possible,” Scolari had said after his team beat Italy on Saturday night. “I hope that you from abroad, who are experiencing the Confederations Cup, know that this is not a usual situation for us.” Things will change, said Scolari. “Perhaps in one, two, five, 20 years — who knows — we might have a better country. But it won’t happen tomorrow.” Clearly not. But that is where the sport, the pledges of government and of FIFA all must come together. President Rousseff told the governors and mayors Monday that there was an emergency-driven need to find physicians in sufficient numbers to work in the poorest areas of Brazil’s major cities. “There are regions in our country where the population has no health care,” she stated. “This cannot continue.” It cannot for the people of Brazil, and also for the million or more visitors that the World Cup is intended to attract next year.

We asked the same questions of South Africa and, by and large, those fears were redundant. But if there is a pact between the host country and FIFA to run an event, what duty of care should FIFA have in guaranteeing the safety of all those who come to play or to watch? Romário, again, has broadcast his concern that Brazil will become a “FIFA State” during the tournament next June and July. “FIFA,” he also contended, “will profit by 4 billion reais from the World Cup, and will not pay any tax to Brazil.” There must be concerns now about security, not merely around the stadiums, but in the cities and off the beaten path where the more adventurous soccer fans might travel. Maybe the measures now proposed by the president — in her words “emergency driven” — will suffice.

But that could depend on promises made under duress today being deliverable tomorrow. And if not? FIFA’s general secretary, Jérôme Valcke said this week there was no Plan B, no intention to move the World Cup to another country. One would hope not, because Brazil, the most successful and most joyous of nations in soccer history, will have waited 64 years to stage its second World Cup. The United States, one imagines, could be the backup plan if there was one. The United States has the stadiums, the capability, the organizational skills and the public spirit to take it on at the drop of a hat. In Europe, Germany still has its 2006 infrastructure in place. England has more than a dozen stadiums, and the experience of staging Premier League soccer games three times a week in every major city. So a Plan B there must be. But the cost to that would be in more than money. It would be the removal of hope in a nation that breathes the sport, and a nation that until now had begun to believe in its economic and structural rebirth. Soccer didn’t get a mention in the presidential speech, but it is central to it.   A version of this article appears in print on June 26, 2013, in The International Herald Tribune.
