Credit Collin Chappelle for The New York Times In San Diego, residents have long heard the charge that their fair city is a place where people put more stock in sunny weather and surfing than in art, architecture and cuisine. But Barrio Logan is challenging that outdated perception. The neighborhood, southeast of downtown, is among its oldest and most diverse. It also has long been a center of Latino culture. Today, a new crop of locally owned art galleries, breweries and restaurants, mostly along Logan Avenue, are popping up alongside the auto body shops and fruterías. ¡Salud! Tacos The owner of ¡Salud! tacos, Ernie Becerra, turned his taco-catering company into a brick and mortar space in 2015. The dinerlike interior evokes the lowrider lifestyle with a tattoo-inspired mural and a pinstripe car hood. The place features tacos like the Barrio, a meat and vegetable stew served on a flour tortilla topped with nopales, avocado and sour cream. 2196 Logan Avenue; 619-255-3856; saludsd.com Image Credit Collin Chappelle for The New York Times Border X Brewing San Diego’s first brewery wholly owned by Latinos moved two years ago to this larger space with a tin ceiling and an outdoor beer garden. The brewery is known for infusing staples of Mexican drinks like hibiscus, agave and whole cinnamon into its award-winning beers, including the crimson-hued Blood Saison and the sour-style Saladito, flavored with salt and coriander. 2181 Logan Avenue; 619-501-0503; borderxbrewing.com Image Credit Collin Chappelle for The New York Times One Bunk Barrio This Airbnb accommodation is in the National, a building whose tenants include an art gallery.
