He was a popular man, affectionately known as Mr. Indiana. Less than half an hour after Brown's fatal heart attack, Lee Corso, then the head coach at Indiana, received a call from an assistant coach at another university. ''I expected the calls of sympathy,'' Corso said. ''Word gets around fast when that happens in our profession. But this first guy who called didn't even express condolences. He just wanted me to know he was available for Coach Brown's job. ''That shows that coaches have no scruples when it comes to trying to get another job. There are lots of them out there and there aren't that many jobs in Division 1-A football coaching. Being aggressive is the nature of the person in coaching and is a necessity to advancement. Coaches are always after what's greener on the other side. It's maybe the result of doing all the work and getting little reward or attention.'' Corso was dismissed last year as Indiana's head coach after 10 seasons with the Hoosiers. He is back to job-hunting while working as a television football commentator. He is luckier than most coaches who find themselves out of work, particularly the assistants.

It was also agreed that without the satisfaction and enjoyment they derive from the job, assistant coaches would give up in face of all the drawbacks - long hours, too much travel away from home, defeats, 18- and 19-year-old athletes whose performances may determine the future of a coaching career, recruiting, not enough professional credit and sometimes low salaries in a very competitive profession. They also are fatalists and either accept the occasional loss of a job or leave coaching.   Their Number Is Limited  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       What has been a competitive occupation throughout its history is made all the more difficult by recent limitations placed on the size of major college football coaching staffs by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. After seven years during which the limit was eight full-time assistant coaches for Division 1-A teams, the N.C.A.A. increased the limit to nine assistants this year. Before 1976 there were no limits to staff size, and some head football coaches hired as many as 15 assistants. The current rule means that the 104 Division 1-A football teams provide a total of 936 full-time assistant coaching jobs. The 85 Division 1-AA football teams are limited to eight full-time assistant coaches each, so there are 680 of these positions available. Divisions II and III have no coaching limits. Economic necessities often dictate staff sizes at those schools. Some of these colleges have as few as one or two assistant coaches and some have only part-time assistants. Some coaches at smaller colleges are required to teach in the academic departments of the institution in addition to their coaching work. Some assistant coaches at major institutions also teach or coach in more than one sport. The N.C.A.A. put a limit of two assistant coaches on major college basketball staffs.   Many Need Extra Jobs An assistant's salary in major college football can range from $18,000 to $50,000 but can be higher in a few cases, according to Charles McClendon, the executive director of the American Football Coaches Association. Many of these assistant coaches supplement their incomes with jobs at summer camps and some make money lecturing at football clinics. The young and eager coaches are not easily discouraged despite the large number of men in the business and the small number of jobs at the top.

Each league reports that the salaries can range from $40,000 to as much as $100,000 for an assistant. With 18 teams in the U.S.F.L. and 28 in the N.F.L. there are about 368 jobs available as an assistant coach in professional football. The National Federation of State High School Associations in Kansas City says there were 13,174 high school varsity 11-man football teams in the United States during the 1982-83 academic year. There were 912 high school teams playing six, eight or nine-man football. In Texas, for example, there are 1,024 high schools that field football teams, according to Donald Jay, the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association. He said there were also more than 1,100 high schools with varsity basketball teams and many other high school varsity sports for boys and girls. ''We have more high school football teams than any other state,'' Jay said. ''And California is the only state with more basketball teams in high school.'' Jay said that there are usually five varsity football assistant coaches, and in some of the bigger schools there are junior varsity teams, B teams and BB teams. ''We may have about 14,000 coaches in the state in all of the sports we have for boys and girls,'' Jay said. So for the assistants at any level who want to try for the top, the competition is difficult and often frustrating.   Looking for a Job Jim Bob Helduser is a 26-year-old former linebacker at Texas Lutheran College who is looking for a new job after spending the last three years as an assistant coach at Rice University. Although his contract at Rice runs through next March, he has been looking for another position ever since the middle of the 1983 season, when Rice announced its plans to dismiss Ray Alborn and his staff when the season ended. Helduser was asked to vacate his office at Rice. He spends most of his time at home now, close to the phone, and caring for his 11-month-old son while his teacher-wife, Christina, is working.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''Basically, you just have to canvass all the openings that occur,'' Helduser said. ''There's not anything for me to be too optimistic about. It is very difficult to get a full-time job as an assistant in a 1-A college. You pretty well have to make a commitment that you will go to work anywhere a job is offered when you go into the college profession. And you have to be willing to move your family.'' Ted Cottrell, a 35-year-old assistant football coach at Rutgers, is in much the same position as Helduser. Cottrell does not expect to be on the staff when a new head coach is hired to replace Frank Burns, who was dismissed last month. But Cottrell's contract runs through the 1984 season, so if he doesn't find anything Rutgers will still be obliged to pay him a salary for another year. This is nothing new to Cottrell, the father of two children. He was on the Rutgers staff for seven years before joining the Kansas City Chiefs' staff in 1981. That was a voluntary move to the N.F.L. The Chiefs changed head coaches this year and the staff was replaced. Cottrell was fortunate enough to get back to Rutgers because the N.C.A.A. had increased the number of assistants allowed.

''I called my wife and told her what happened. She said, 'Well, don't worry about it, but be sure that on your way home you pick up some milk and bread for dinner tonight.' '' Cottrell said, ''I have been told that my contract through 1984 will not be renewed. I don't have any resentments. I have come to accept this as the practice in the profession. I'm looking for what's available out there.''  Some Suggest a Union More than once in the last 30 years, some assistant coaches have talked of forming a union. There is little security in the profession, according to most coaches, and there are no universal retirement benefit plans common to the industry. But no union move has ever got beyond the discussion point. Cottrell said, ''I think there might be need for a union. It would not be a bad thing. There have been moves for one, but nothing happened. There might be another move someday. ''A union would not be for salary scales or vacations or that sort of thing. It might help just to air grievances and possibly for some retirement benefits. Everyone can't be a head coach and get the big money, although we all try and want it.''  ''I hope we never have to come to a union,'' said McClendon. ''My pet project since I've been director of the coaches association is to be able to help the assistant coaches some way. I'm trying to do something where they can have some kind of annuity that is transferable from college to college just the way some professor retirement benefits and insurance plans work. ''Good young coaches in their twenties know they are going to starve, but they go into the darn business anyway. They know they are going to have to fight for their lives. Then in five or 10 years they begin to realize, 'What do I have? What can I provide for my family?'

Then, if their head coach leaves for any reason, an assistant would have a little cushion where he wouldn't have to push the panic button.''  College coaching was almost exclusively a man's profession until the last few years. Women are now entering the business to coach the increasing number of women's varsity teams. They have the same problems as male assistant coaches and get less reward for their work, according to some in the business. Jennifer Bednarek, a former star on Penn State's women's basketball team, began as an assistant coach at Iowa this season. This is her third assistant coaching job since she was graduated from Penn State in 1980. So far, the 25-year-old native of New Jersey has not lost a job. She has moved to what she believes to be a better job each time.   Salaries Lower Than Men's ''Status-wise and salary-wise we don't compare to men coaches,'' Miss Bednarek said. ''This is frustrating because we are putting in the same hours, do basically the same work in coaching and recruiting and traveling all over the country. Of course, the men's team draws 16,000 here, while we had a record crowd for Iowa women's basketball the other night of 4,000. ''But good things take time, and someday we will be up with the men in all those things. I'm not bitter about this at all. George Raveling, the men's head coach, has been wonderful to us, given us all the help he can, and always encouraged us. We're not in any macho situation at all. It's just that we don't get paid as much - yet.'' Chalmers (Bump) Elliott, Iowa's director of athletics for men, said that Raveling has a salary of $60,000 a year and that his assistants are paid between $38,000 and $42,000 each. Many top male coaches can make significant extra money from television programs, endorsements, clinics and speeches. According to Miss Bednarek, Vivian Stringer, the women's head basketball coach at Iowa, makes $50,000 in salary. Asked her salary, Miss Bednarek said, ''We make relative to Vivian's salary what the man assistants make to George's salary.'' In rare cases there is stability in assistant coaching. This usually happens where there are years of success on the field.  Such is the case at Nebraska, where Tom Osborne succeeded Bob Devaney in 1973 without making many changes. Cletus Fischer, a former Nebraska back who played one year for the New York Giants (1949), has been a relatively secure assistant football coach with the Cornhuskers for 24 years. Fischer is one of two coaches responsible for the offensive line, the hallmark of Cornhusker football teams in the last two decades. The owner of two farms producing wheat and corn, Fischer is a native of Nebraska who expects to retire to his farms ''in probably another three or four years.''  'Never Had a Contract'   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''I never had a contract,'' Fischer added. ''I don't think I ever saw one. We had a card once years ago. It just was some I.D. card saying we worked for the university. ''Certainly I feel fortunate being here instead of moving every three or four years. When I got into this, the salaries weren't all that great. If I had to do it over again, I might look into it a little more. But Nebraska has had such a successful program with Bob Devaney and Tom that it's been great here.'' Fischer is the assistant who was responsible for recruiting some of the finest players in recent Nebraska history, including Johnny Rodgers, the wingback; Dave Rimington, the center, and Dean Steinkuhler, the guard. Rodgers won the Heisman Trophy in 1972. Rimington won the Outland Trophy in 1981 and 1982 as the best interior lineman in the nation those two seasons and Steinkuhler won the Outland this year as well as the Vince Lombardi Award, which goes to the outstanding lineman in the country.  All three of these athletes came from eastern Nebraska, Fischer's recruiting territory. Fischer, 58, said, ''Recruiting doesn't wear on me. I sort of enjoy it. I'm just here in the state recruiting and I don't have to get on an airplane and go all over the country. And people know me all over the state.'' Fischer is the exception to the rule that led Frank Broyles, the former Arkansas head coach, to say, ''A coach is just another form of migrant worker and a head coach is a migrant worker disguised as a millionaire.'' Fischer is an example of security through strength on the field. Not all coaches have to struggle for this security as many colleges, particularly at the levels below Division 1-A in football, offer tenure similar to that gained by professors. The University of Delaware with a Division 1-AA football team and a Division I basketball team gives tenure to all of its coaches, head and assistant, after 10 years service, according to David M. Nelson, the director of athletics. Nelson said he had four tenured football coaches - Harold (Tubby) Raymond, the head coach, and three assistants. A few Division 1-A football schools also offer tenure to certain coaches. Joe Paterno, Penn State's head coach, has tenure and so do three of his nine assistants. Cottrell said, ''When you plan to get married, you tell your fiancee how much you enjoy being an assistant coach and all that it means to you and what the future may hold. You don't tell her you have a secure career because it's not a secure career.''    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
