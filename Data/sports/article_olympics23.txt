Photo        Chicago hosted Farm Aid in its 30th year.   Credit Rob Grabowski/Invision, via Associated Press    The most recent Farm Aid concert drew about 26,000 people to Chicago over the weekend. It was headlined, as usual, by Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp and Neil Young, who founded the benefit show.
