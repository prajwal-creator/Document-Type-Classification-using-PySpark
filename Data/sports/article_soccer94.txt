Credit Ruby Washington/The New York Times     The city still burns bright as a beacon of immigrant aspiration, and the proof these days can be found clustering in bars and cafes, and spilling onto the streets, in raucous displays of multinational pride during the World Cup. On Tuesday morning at the original outpost of Mercadito, a tiny taqueria on Avenue B that attracts a young, hip crowd and feels like a resort cantina, a mellow version of this phenomenon played out as Mexico struggled against Uruguay. Even with a $25 all-you-can-eat tacos or wings special on offer during games, not everyone can show up at 10 a.m. for soccer. Those who did — a few couples up front, a group of men in back — sat transfixed, at times rising halfway out of their seats, calling out “Vamos,” or clasping their hands as if in prayer when either team came close to triumph or disaster. DIANE CARDWELL IN THE SEATS Giannina Perez, 38, a public policy advocate for children’s issues, and her husband, Guillermo Mayer, 36, a civil rights lawyer. ON THE PLATES To share, guacamole ($7); for Mr. Mayer, chilaquiles al chipotle ($12), which he pronounced “very well done” and encouraged Ms. Perez to sample. She was waiting for her huevos rancheros ($12) to come back scrambled rather than over easy; she is four months pregnant and wants to make sure any eggs she eats are fully cooked. WHY THEY CAME Fans of soccer who are on vacation from Oakland, Calif., the couple looked online for a place with good food in an interesting neighborhood to watch Mexico play. Mr. Mayer is originally from Guadalajara, roots his wife seems to identify with, even though her family is from Peru. “It’s Mexico,” she said fondly in explaining why they needed to see the match, adding as she patted her belly, “and I’m having a Mexican baby.” Uruguay won, 1-0, but both teams survived to move into the next round. WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT Not so much — after all, there was a game on — except to weigh the options for the rest of the day, like a trip uptown to the American Museum of Natural History.
