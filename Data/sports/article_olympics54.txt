So is Tara VanDerveer, the Stanford women’s basketball coach, a Tiger mother? “A little bit, yeah,” she conceded. “I think it’s only because I really care about them and I would hate for them to not be able to accomplish what they’re capable of.” VanDerveer follows the same guiding principle as Amy Chua, the author of “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,” who wrote , “What Chinese parents understand is that nothing is fun until you’re good at it.” In the book of Tara, the oral teachings that every Stanford player quickly commits to memory, VanDerveer says: “You want to have fun? Try winning. Now that’s fun.” This season has been one long joy ride for VanDerveer and the Cardinal, which is 31-2, with a victory against top-ranked Connecticut and a perfect record at Maples Pavilion behind it and a Round of 16 game against North Carolina this weekend in Spokane, Wash.

They are into details, not drama, which plays to VanDerveer’s strength.

She professes to be learning about the game all the time and describes herself as still “crazy into it” after all these years. The proof is there for all her athletes to see, as when they find her watching game tape while exercising on a treadmill. Or peek into the walk-in closet in her office, which is stacked with VHS tapes and piles of DVDs of games dating back decades. “She knows how hard we work and she wants to reward us by working just as hard,” Lindy La Rocque, a junior guard, said, adding: “She gets us as prepared as possible. She complains about her eyesight all the time, but when it comes to seeing a missed screen or a false step on defense, she has eagle eyes.” After Stanford dispatched U.C. Davis in the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, the Aggies’ coach, Sandy Simpson, noted that the Cardinal players made up for their one clear shortcoming — team speed — “by knowing the angles and getting to places sooner.” “It’s like they see the game a second or two ahead as opposed to seeing it in real time,” he said. Because the team collectively carries well above a B grade-point average, there is a tendency to ascribe the crispness of Stanford’s execution to the sharpness of the players’ minds. La Rocque suggested as much when she described one of the team’s assets: “We’re all students of the game; we’re all intelligent.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   VanDerveer let La Rocque have her say, then gave an impassioned rebuttal. She rejected the notion that her team’s path to the Final Four was somehow a velvet rope line because the players were book smart. The Cardinal’s success is a product of endless instruction, she said, not natural instincts.  Photo        VanDerveer, with Mikaela Ruef.

So we go over stuff constantly. I really believe that for me personally and for us, we have to outwork people.” VanDerveer grew up in upstate New York, the oldest of five children of parents who were teachers. Her high school did not have a girls’ basketball team — “My players don’t believe that,” she wryly noted — and although she did compete in college, at Indiana, it was during the infancy of women’s intercollegiate athletics, when seven- to nine-game schedules were the norm. She arrived at Stanford in 1985 after leading Ohio State to four Big Ten championships and three N.C.A.A. tournament appearances. Except for a one-year leave of absence to coach the United States women’s basketball team to a gold medal at the 1996 Olympics, VanDerveer has been a ballast in a sea of change. Stanford has had eight football coaches and three athletic directors during her tenure.

When changes in athletic directors happen, there were times where I definitely thought I should be looking at other schools.” She praised Bob Bowlsby, who has been Stanford’s athletic director since 2006. “I think that one of the things we as coaches want is to feel appreciated,” she said, “and there were times when I definitely did not feel that.” VanDerveer regards the athletic department as a team, and as is the case with her own players, she strives to build a collaborative environment, free of cliques. To promote the wrestling program, she agreed recently to be photographed wearing a singlet and head gear. With her players, she arranges bonding activities like charades and is constantly exploring ways to make basketball learning less monotonous. Before the Cardinal played St. John’s in the second round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, she divided her players into two teams for a “Family Feud” contest. They competed to name the correct answers to questions posed by VanDerveer, who was occupying the role of the game show’s host, Steve Harvey. A sample question: Who are St. John’s starting five? VanDerveer has created the kind of environment that her teenage, inquisitive, driven self would have thrived in. Still, she said: “Sometimes I worry that I’m like the parent that’s like ‘You go study!,’ that says: ‘How come you got a B? You could have gotten an A.’ ”   A version of this article appears in print on March 23, 2011, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: Under Stanford’s VanDerveer, a Master Class Ever in Session.
