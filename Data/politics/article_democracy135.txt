After a wave of defections from his cabinet, and as protests turned violent in Athens amid a general strike, Mr. Papademos told lawmakers that they must approve new austerity measures demanded by Greece’s creditors — including a 22 percent cut in the benchmark minimum wage and public-sector layoffs — or the country would suffer a disorderly default with social dislocation and would eventually leave the euro zone. After a five-hour meeting, the cabinet approved the package, sending it on to Parliament for final approval, perhaps as early as Sunday. The prime minister’s comments kicked off what is expected to be a long and chaotic weekend of brinkmanship, with Greek politicians fighting for their survival in the face of unpopular austerity measures and European leaders demanding more concessions in a climate of growing urgency — and mistrust — between Greece and its foreign lenders.

The troika has also made passage of the measures a condition for sealing a deal in which private creditors will take voluntary losses of up to 70 percent of Greek debt.

Europe has lost confidence that the Greek government has the will or capacity to follow through on its commitments to structural changes. Greeks, whose standard of living is dropping precipitously with no end in sight, have lost confidence that the bailout will actually save the country from default.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       With so many variables and so little time, some experts said that almost any outcome was possible, from disorderly default and chaos to a new agreement and at least temporary calm. “Greece defaulting is probably just as likely to happen as a result of an accident as an act of will,” said Platon Tinios, an economist at the University of Piraeus. “If you are skating at the edge of a precipice, the slightest push could push you over.” For now, both sides appear to lack a viable Plan B. Behind closed doors in Brussels at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Thursday, the lack of trust was evident — and may have put the entire bailout at risk. The ministers had been expected to approve with little fuss the austerity package negotiated among Greek politicians. Instead, the European ministers made it plain that they did not believe the figures provided by Greece. They jolted Athens by insisting that it find an additional $428 million in savings — to make up for a shortfall created by the refusal of political leaders to slash supplemental pensions — before their next meeting, expected on Wednesday. In one of several tough exchanges, the Greek finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, was taken to task by the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, for having failed to begin the required negotiations with labor unions over the reduction in the minimum wage. At some point in the evening, an open television microphone recorded a markedly different exchange between Mr. Schäuble and the finance minister of Portugal , which faces an austerity-driven economic slump similar to Greece’s. If Portugal needed to ease its bailout terms, “we would be ready to do it,” Mr. Schäuble said in a friendly conversation broadcast on a private Portuguese network, TVI. “That’s much appreciated,” replied his counterpart from Portugal, Vitor Gaspar.

Because of Greece’s failure to meet budget targets amid a recession aggravated by the troika-imposed austerity regimen, its lenders no longer believe the $170 billion bailout will be enough. But the I.M.F. does not want to provide extra financing, because its analysts do not believe Greece’s debt load is sustainable.

The measures are understandably unpopular in Greece, where politicians are positioning themselves for elections that could be held as soon as April, although two of the three parties in the coalition have said they want to delay them until 2013.

Several coalition legislators have indicated that they object to certain measures — chiefly wage cuts — and may vote against them but it would take a huge backbench rebellion for the vote to fail as the two largest parties have 236 seats in the 300-member house. Mr. Karatzaferis called on Mr. Papademos to reshuffle his cabinet and replace Socialist ministers with technocrats. He also accused creditors of trying to “deprive Greece of the last trace of national sovereignty” and expressed frustration with German officials, who have taken a hard line in the negotiations.
