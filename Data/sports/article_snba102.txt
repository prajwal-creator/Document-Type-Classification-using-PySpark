It's never happened. In order to be chosen unanimously for enshrinement at Cooperstown, a player must be named on every ballot by those members of the Baseball Writers Association of America who vote in that year. The closest to perfection so far was Ty Cobb, one of the original five members of the Hall, who was named on ballots by 222 of the 226 voters in 1936, a 98.2 percentage. Others to come close were: Henry Aaron in 1982 with 406 of 415 for 97.8 percent; Honus Wagner and Babe Ruth in 1936, each with 215 of 226 for 95.1 percent, and Willie Mays in 1979 (409 of 432 for (94.6 percent). QUESTION: Did Granny Hamner ever hit .300 in the major leagues and did he have a brother who also played for the Philadelphia Phillies? No and yes. Hamner's highest season average in the majors was .299 for the Phillies in 1954, when he had 178 hits in 152 games while playing second base. He was the Phillies' regular shortstop from 1949-52 and at 23 years of age one of the chief ''Whiz Kids'' who won the pennant for Philadelphia in 1950. His brother Garvin, three years older, appeared in 21 games, all in 1945, at second base and shortstop, getting 20 hits and batting .198. Granny, who first appeared in the majors at 17 in 1944 and ended his career as an infielder with Cleveland in 1959, did lead the Phillies with a .429 average in the 1950 World Series, going 6 for 14 as the Phillies lost to the Yankees in four straight. He called it quits for good after attempting a comeback as a relief pitcher with the Kansas City Athletics in 1962. For his career of 1,531 games, Hamner averaged .262 with 104 home runs. His pitching career was less impressive: 0-2 with a 5.40 earned run average in seven games covering 13 innings.

Even though he faces a third down and 20 situation on Team B's 40-yard line, the Team A quarterback decides on a pass play in the belief that he can either pick up enough yardage to position a field goal attempt that could raise his team's lead to an insurmountable 8 points or he could make the first down that will enable his team to run out the clock. But the rush by the defense is so swift and effective that his pass attempt is batted in the air, then caught near midfield by a Team B player, who has a clear field to the end zone for the points that would give Team B the victory. If the player rambles downfield with the interception followed only by his teammates, can he pause just before he crosses the goal line in order to take enough time off the clock that Team A will never get the ball again in the game? Or will the play be whistled dead when his forward progress stops?  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Although it seems contrary to the aim of the game, it's sometimes wise to make sure your opponent gets into the end zone as quickly as he can. A ball-carrier should always be pursued and never allowed to dawdle on his way to the end zone, for there's always the possibility that the runner will slip, or develop a cramp or even drop the ball (see: Jerry Rice, San Francisco vs. Giants, Jan. 4, 1987).  QUESTION: Players on the winning team each get a ring for their Super Bowl victory, but what about members of the losing team? After they've finished wringing their hands, the losers earn rings for their fingers, too, but not for being runner-up in the game. The losers' rings celebrate the conference championship they won that carried them into the Super Bowl. The National Football League makes available $3,000 each toward a Super Bowl ring for 90 members of the winning organization, including coaches, assistants, trainers, front office personnel and any other members the organization deems deserving. For the Super Bowl loser, there is $1,500 available from the league per conference championship ring. If teams want to commemorate their achievments more extravagantly, they pay the difference, as the Chicago Bears did last year after they ran rings around the Patriots in the Super Bowl.
