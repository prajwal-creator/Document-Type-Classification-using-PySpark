While the soldiers, whose activity was not recounted in the article, were indeed firing rifles at stone throwers in the West Bank town of Al Ram last month, the rifles contained rubber bullets. NATIONAL An article on Thursday about Congressional testimony by the director of the F.B.I. carried an erroneous dateline. The article was reported and written in Washington, not in Baghdad. • An article last Friday about Bay Area Russian expatriates voting in the Russian presidential election misstated the length of Vladimir Putin’s presidential terms. His most recent campaign was for his third term, not his third six-year term. (The law was changed. His first two terms were four years, but his third term will be six years.) BUSINESS DAY An article on Thursday about the growing role of the British government in the management of Royal Bank of Scotland, in which it took a majority stake as part of a 2008 bailout, referred incorrectly to the slogan on a poster that some bank employees have displayed on their desk. “Keep Calm and Carry On” was printed on a poster developed in 1939 for distribution in the event of a Nazi invasion of Britain. Only a few were ever distributed; it was not “Britain’s World War II slogan.” (An original copy of the poster surfaced in 2000 and reproductions became popular.)

The photograph was of the Devils’ David Clarkson scoring against Henrik Lundqvist in the third period. It did not show the Devils’ Marek Zidlicky toppling the Rangers’ Ryan Callahan during the first period. (A picture of the Zidlicky and Callahan play was published in another edition.)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       • An article on Tuesday about the well-rounded season of Devils forward Ilya Kovalchuk misidentified the site of the Devils’ game against the Rangers that night. It was at Prudential Center in Newark, not at Madison Square Garden. • An article on Saturday about an Islamic school in Houston that sought membership in the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools misstated the name of the school that played an Orthodox Jewish school in Tapps’s boys’ basketball state semifinals, a game that was rescheduled under legal pressure because of the Jewish team’s observance of the Sabbath. It is the Covenant School in Dallas, not the Convent School. The error was repeated in an accompanying picture caption. SPECIAL SECTION: RETIREMENT An article on Thursday about 403(b) retirement plans, used by employees of many nonprofit organizations, misspelled the given name and misstated the surname of a Los Angeles teacher who is on the school board’s retirement investment advisory committee. He is Alan Warhaftig, not Allan Warfhig. OBITUARIES An obituary on April 8, 2011, about the computer programmer Jean Jennings Bartik erroneously attributed a distinction to her. She was not the last surviving member of the group of women who programmed the Eniac, considered the first all-electronic digital computer. One other member of that group, Frances Bilas Spence, is still alive. The error was pointed out in an e-mail from Ms. Spence’s son on March 3.
