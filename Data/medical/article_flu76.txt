Bowen, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, has issued a warning reminding parents that children and teen-agers with flu symptoms should not be given aspirin. The use of aspirin in flu or chicken pox cases in young people has been linked to Reyes syndrome, a disease that can cause death or brain damage. Dr. Bowen said in his warning that outbreaks of influenza had been reported in 35 states. In December, most manufacturers of aspirin agreed to put voluntary warnings against the use of aspirin by youngsters with flu or chicken pox symptoms. A regulation making such warnings mandatory is expected to go into force later this year. Consumer advocates say that is not soon enough. Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, head of the Health Research Group, has been pressing the Government to require the warnings since the aspirin-Reyes link was determined five years ago by a panel of the Centers for Disease Control.

''Since then, 100 deaths and dozens of cases of brain damage have occurred that are linked to aspirin and Reyes. Many of these could have been avoided with mandatory warning labels. It is a preventable disease.'' FOR a conference on the pharmaceutical needs of the elderly, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association invited as its main speaker Cyril F. Brickfield, the executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons.

''It is no secret that drug prices in the United States are the highest in the world,'' Mr. Brickfield told the drug makers. He asserted that drug prices were rising higher than other costs faced by older people. ''We at the A.A.R.P. do not believe that such sharp price increases can be justified, particularly when they must be paid in many cases by the sickest and poorest among us,'' he said. Afterward, in an interview, Gerald J. Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, rebutted the criticism. Prices have to be high enough, he said, to finance the research and development of new drugs. In any event, he asserted, drug prices have not increased as steeply as the full Consumer Price Index. He also denied that the brand-name drug makers were misrepresenting the generic makers' procedures.

THE Department of Transportation has published an updated edition of the old Civil Aeronautics Board booklet ''Fly Rights,'' which lists the consumer protections available to passengers. The areas covered include fares, reservations, tickets, delays, cancellations, overbooking (popularly known as bumping), baggage, smoking and safety. Of particular interest to consumers are places to which complaints may be sent. Safety complaints should be sent to the Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, D.C. 20591, while nonsafety complaints should go to the Transportation Department, 400 Seventh Street SW, Washington, D.C. 20590. The booklet may be obtained by sending a $1 check or money order made out to the Superintendent of Documents, Department 165-P, Consumer Information Center, Pueblo, Colo. 81009. REPRESENTATIVE Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, and Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, have introduced a bill that would require that all packaged foods carry labels listing calories, the amount and kind of fat (saturated, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated), cholesterol, and the amounts of sodium and potassium. Mr. Rangel is concerned about sodium, most of which comes from salt, because it is a cause of high blood pressure, or hypertension. Mr. Rangel's district includes Harlem, a predominantly black area, and blacks have a higher rate of hypertension than whites. Present law requires that packages carry such information only if a nutritional claim is made for the food. The Food and Drug Administration had been planning in 1979 to require the labeling sought by the Rangel-Metzenbaum bill, but it was deferred when the Reagan Administration took office, according to an aide to Mr. Rangel.
