Jesse Jackson, left, and T. J. Holmes on “Don’t Sleep!”   Credit Scott Wintrow/PictureGroup     THIS month, Black Entertainment Television unveiled “ Don’t Sleep! Hosted by T. J. Holmes ,” a social-issues show with a faint humorous streak. In the vein of “Real Time With Bill Maher” and, in spots, “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,” it’s a familiar format, with each episode touching on a hot-button topic through a combination of statistics, punchy round-table conversation and a bit of ribbing of those who fall on the wrong side of the opinion of Mr. Holmes, a former CNN anchor now empowered to be both stern and loose at the same time. In one of the first episodes, the issue was code-switching, as part of a discussion of the reappearance of a video of President Obama speaking to an audience largely comprising black ministers in 2007 in a tone of voice that conservative commentators all but deemed alien, though it was easily recognizable to anyone who’d ever set foot in a black church on Sunday, or who’d watched an episode of “ Amen .” It was an apt discussion for a show that itself represents a sort of code-switching for the network, known as BET. In recent years, BET has diminished the role of music in its offerings, much as other former music video channels like MTV and VH1 have done. But music still looms large, even as BET has dabbled in reality shows and original scripted programming. But it has always at least paid lip service to issues programming: “Don’t Sleep!” is part of a long lineage. BET has cultural obligations that those other channels don’t have. Despite competition, it remains the highest-profile television outlet aimed at a black audience. Including issues programming as part of its mandate, whether by proactive choice or defensive posture, has always been part of the tenuous balance BET has had to strike.

The weekend before the debut of “Don’t Sleep!” the annual BET Hip-Hop Awards show was taped in Atlanta. (It aired on Oct. 9.) This is the channel’s bread and butter — a ceremony full of performances by rap stars, hosted by a well-regarded black comedian, Mike Epps — basically an extension of the countdown show “ 106 & Park ,” which has been the channel’s anchor program essentially since the show made its debut in 2000. (The channel has been around since 1980.)

This is bad luck, to be sure, but also a reminder of some of the frustrations that come with the turf and that also cast shadows over the channel’s often worthy efforts to broaden its scope.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       “Don’t Sleep!” arrives in the thick of election season, a mélange of information and straight talk, with only a few labored punch lines strewn about. Set pieces include a segment in which Mr. Holmes speaks directly to a newsmaker who needs a talking-to, and each episode features a round-table conversation with Mr. Holmes and black politicians, intellectuals, celebrities and religious leaders. The show’s tone varies widely, from pedantic, especially when dealing with statistics, to rollicking during the conversations. Even more notable is the strenuous attempts to strike political balance; seemingly every black American not voting for President Obama has been a panelist so far. (In case you were wondering, Jimmie J. J. Walker is interested in third-party candidates.)  Photo        O. J. Simpson, left, and Ed Gordon in 1996.   Credit BET News, via Reuters    In this, “Don’t Sleep!” can be guilty of something it’s trying to address, which is giving black conservative voices disproportionate airing; as the panelist Marc Lamont Hill, a Columbia professor, put it in one episode, “that line is shorter.” But seeing a black Republican on BET, as part of a variety of perspectives, feels far more productive than seeing one on Fox News, trotted out for the cover of diversity. This tension on “Don’t Sleep!” — and by extension, within BET itself — has made for fascinating interactions, both on their own terms and because rarely are black commentators on other networks afforded the opportunity to highlight their differences. In one episode, the R&B singer Monifah, a star of the reality show “R&B Divas” (on TV One, a BET competitor), squared off against Rev. A. R. Bernard of the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn over the issue of gay marriage. (Monifah is in a same-sex relationship.) The third panelist, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, tried to strike a diplomatic balance between the two. On other nights, the film director Ava DuVernay derided Mitt Romney for being interested only in those who are “part of dominant culture,” and the Rev. Markel Hutchins spoke of Mr. Romney’s advocacy for states’ rights as a return to Jim Crow-era ideology. The best decision the show’s producers have made is hiring Issa Rae, of the hilarious Web series “ Awkward Black Girl ,” to do “Daily Show”-style segments about some of the odder, seamier or unintentionally comedic corners of black popular culture. She writes her own material, and it crackles.

He discussed interracial unions in blunt terms: “So yep, in the South, what created Halle Berry was once against the law. We almost didn’t have that, folks.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   When giving a virtual lecture to a group of Americans who were hanging chairs from trees — lynching them, basically — after Clint Eastwood’s mangled Republican National Convention performance, Mr. Holmes tried Jesse Jackson-esque floridity: “Check my inflection so that there is no misdirection. You’ve got some odd preconception of what looks to me like self-deception, so let me take it in a more plain direction: That was racist, yo.” Mr. Holmes cuts a figure of casual, smooth authority: slim-fitting suit, two buttons open on his shirt, French cuffs, neat pocket squares. At the end of the show’s second week, he added a tie, perhaps because he looked a little bit like he was on a date he hoped would end well. He hasn’t completely shaken free of the patterns of the straight-news anchor, but that contrast is useful; when he grows incensed, and he frequently does, especially when it comes to knee-jerk conservatism, it scans as genuine, a tear in the social code.

He’s looser than Ed Gordon, who anchored news programs on the channel for more than two decades, but far more serious than, say, Prince DaJour and Ananda Lewis, who were the best-known hosts of BET’s “ Teen Summit ,” an earnest, casual and often successful effort at integrating entertainment and social issues, pairing guided discussions involving its young audience with musical performances. Where BET has fallen short over the years is in spanning the chasm between issues and music programming. It didn’t take as intense a dive into reality shows the way MTV or VH1 did. As a result, plenty of black-themed shows ended up on other channels. Add that to the rise of competitors like TV One and Centric. What’s more, often the black programming on other networks has been riskier and more agenda-pushing — for humor, take “ Chappelle’s Show “ a few years ago or even “ Key & Peele “ now, both on Comedy Central; for reality, take any of the “Love & Hip Hop” or “Basketball Wives” franchises on VH1. To BET’s credit, it rarely skews as benign as the Tyler Perry juggernaut that’s overtaken TBS (and soon, the Oprah Winfrey Network). There is an edgier politics option, too: “ Totally Biased With W. Kamau Bell ,” on FX, which is far funnier than “Don’t Sleep!” but isn’t always sharper. One of the most bracing moments on “Don’t Sleep!” came when Mr. Holmes recalled an incident in which he was deposed for a lawsuit brought by a white man whom he’d replaced in a job, challenging his qualifications. It wasn’t done under the cover of humor, or irony. It was naked and angry and effective. It was also a reminder of the strength of this show, and certainly its implicit purpose. An advocacy streak runs throughout it — in favor of gay marriage, in favor of affirmative action, against demeaning reality-TV portrayals of black women. In short, it’s building a set of social and political norms that could apply not just to this show, but also to a channel that’s looking to speak with one voice.
