The guy who wore the Andrew Dice Clay T-shirt until, he said, "it got up and walked out of camp on its own." The guy who rode his Harley-Davidson motorcycle to lunch each day? Who is this guy in the plain white T-shirt, the tan slacks and the baseball cap with the Swiss Army insignia over a regulation haircut, pretending that he is Jets defensive end Jeff Lageman? Is it that Lageman, at age 25, has simply calmed down? "Has he?" Coach Bruce Coslet said today. "It's still preseason. He's just getting warmed up. Don't worry about him. It'll never happen. He'll never calm down. A leopard doesn't change his spots. You know that." Shift of Position When Coslet took over the helm of the Jets in 1990, he asked Lageman, a first-round choice in the 1989 draft, to shift from right outside linebacker in a 3-4 system to pass-rushing defensive end in a 4-3 system.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Is he doing all right? "All right?" Coslet said. "They haven't blocked him yet. He's fine. He's going to have a hell of a year. He's grown into his body. He's a natural 265-266. He knows his position. He rushes the passer. He plays the run. He's a team leader. He takes care of things in the locker room. "I mean, he's a pro. He's a little off the wall and we all know that and we love him for it. But when he goes on the football field, he plays football." That was evident last year, when Lageman had his best season as a pro: He led the team in sacks for the first time, with 10, had 68 tackles, 50 of them by himself, and forced three fumbles. Last Saturday in the Jets' scrimmage against the Washington Redskins at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., he led all Jets defenders with four unassisted tackles, two of them sacks. Lageman will start the season as the only man on the defensive line in the position he played last year, but that doesn't bother him.

Since switching to defensive end, Lageman has added almost 30 pounds of muscle to his 6-foot-5-inch frame. "I don't want to weigh any more than I do now," he said today. "I'm at 266 now. My body fat is down about 2 percent from last year to about 11 percent, which is reasonable. "I feel good right now," said Lageman, whose only competition at his spot is 6-3, 265-pound Donnie Gardner, a plan B acquisition from Miami in his second year as a pro. "My goal right now is to improve certain areas, maintain what I did last year in certain areas and just be more of an every down player. It feels good coming back as a starter, number one, and number two, I can work on something else besides my weight and learn how to play the position like I know I can play the position."

No More Motorcycle "I had a couple of bad dreams about wrecking that bike in the off season," Lageman said, "so I sold it rather than keeping it around in the garage where I might be tempted to ride it. "I started thinking a little bit more about my teammates than myself. What would they do if I hurt myself. Now I drive a big, 4,000-pound Bronco with bumpers all around it." EXTRA POINTS There was no morning practice and running back BLAIR THOMAS sat out the afternoon session battling a flu-like bug. . . . Center JIM SWEENEY also did not practice, instead having tests done on his sore elbow. . . . Wide receiver ROB MOORE, who missed Saturday's scrimmage with left ankle problems, had a limited workout, catching passes on the sideline.
