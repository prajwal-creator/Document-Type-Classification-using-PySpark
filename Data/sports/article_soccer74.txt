Langlands, a former British colonial officer and an educator who has lived in Pakistan since the country’s birth 65 years ago and, at 94, is contemplating retirement, misstated Mr. Langlands’s relationship to the Langlands School and College, an institution in Chital, Pakistan, that has become synonymous with excellence. He ran the school and was a major force in its development; he was not its founder. A picture caption with the continuation of the article repeated the error. The article also misstated the given name of a local development worker who called Mr. Langlands “invaluable” and someone who could not be replaced. He is Sultan Mehmood, not Multan. NEW YORK A picture caption on Thursday with the City Room column, about a 40th-anniversary celebration for Ms. magazine, misidentified the woman who was shown trying on a Wonder Woman outfit at a City Hall party. She is Karin Lippert, the first promotion director at Ms. — not Mary Peacock, a founding editor. (Wonder Woman was on the cover of the first issue.) • An article in some editions on Monday about a lawsuit filed against the New York Police Department for its handling of a traffic death investigation made an erroneous comparison in describing the frequency of traffic deaths in New York City. In recent years more people have been killed by guns than in traffic accidents, not the other way around. • The About New York column on Wednesday, about a silent protest planned against the New York Police Department’s stop, question and frisk practices misidentified the location of a church where Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg addressed the issue on Sunday. He spoke in Brooklyn, not Queens.

Both Highlight and Circle show a user’s location on a map; Skout and About.me give the location, but do not map it.

They are the Miami Marlins, not the Florida Marlins. (The team changed its name before the season.) • Because of an editing error, a picture caption in some editions on June 7 with an article about the pedigree and performance of I’ll Have Another, who had won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, misidentified the source who had made the horse a strong favorite to win the Belmont Stakes. It was the oddsmaker at Belmont Park, not bettors. • An Associated Press report in some copies on Wednesday about a 1-1 tie between the United States men’s soccer team and Guatemala in a World Cup qualifier misstated the day of the game. It was Tuesday, not Thursday. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the day of the scoreless tie between Jamaica and Antigua. It was also Tuesday, not Friday. THE ARTS An article on Thursday about a new theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Richard B. Fisher Building, misstated its role in the Academy’s annual Next Wave Festival, which starts in September. Festival performances will take place at the Howard Gilman Opera House and at the Harvey Theater as well as at the Fisher building; the building is not the “new home” of the festival. The article also referred incorrectly to ticket prices for the festival. Tickets for events at the Fisher building — not all tickets for the festival — will be $20.
