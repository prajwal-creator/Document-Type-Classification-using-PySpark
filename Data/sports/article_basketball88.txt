Ms. McDonald’s terrific performance moves beyond mimicry to become a haunting portrait of a troubled artist who could only find equilibrium in her life when she lost herself in her music (1:30). Circle in the Square, 235 West 50th Street, Manhattan, 212-239-6200, ladydayonbroadway.com.

Previews and Openings ‘And I and Silence’ (in previews; opens on Monday) New Yorkers know Naomi Wallace for “One Flea Spare,” a stunner of a psychosexual drama, set during the Black Death. They’ll get to know her better during her tenure as one of the Signature’s Residency One playwrights. (A.R. Gurney is the other). The season opens with her play “And I and Silence,” set in the 1950s, about two young women who form a risky friendship while in prison. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Alexis Soloski) ‘Bootycandy’ (previews start on Friday; opens on Sept. 10) Robert O’Hara’s playlets, which consider contemporary black and gay life, might not taste so sweet. As this work’s writer and director, Mr. O’Hara lends his barbed, funny voice to sketches involving divorcing lesbians, vindictive trysts and an effeminate teenager. Several members of the original cast — the play had its premiere in 2011 at the Woolly Mammoth Theater in Washington, D.C. — will reunite for the New York opening. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Soloski) ‘The Fatal Weakness’ (in previews; opens on Sept. 15) George Kelly’s last produced play centers on Olivia, a hopeless romantic. So hopeless that she even blesses her husband’s attraction to a comely orthopedist. The Mint Theater, which recently staged Kelly’s “Philip Goes Forth,” revives this rather unromantic comedy from 1946. Jesse Marchese faithfully directs the infidelity. Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, 866-811-4111, minttheater.org. (Soloski) ‘It’s Only a Play’ (previews start on Thursday; opens on Oct. 9) In the film version of the “Producers” musical, Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane sing “There’s Nothing Like a Show on Broadway.” Apparently, they believe it. They’ve reunited for another play, this time starring in Terrence McNally’s 1982 work about cast and creatives awaiting reviews of a show fatefully titled, “The Golden Egg.” Jack O’Brien directs; Stockard Channing, Megan Mullally, Rupert Grint and F. Murray Abraham co-star. Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, itsonlyaplay.com. (Soloski) ‘My Mañana Comes’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Sept. 4) Think of all the plates in all the restaurants in all the boroughs of New York City. Now think of the people who have to clear them. Elizabeth Irwin’s play, set behind the dining room of an upscale eatery, follows four young men who are hoping for the tip or the chance that will transform their lives. Chay Yew directs. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Soloski) ‘Red Eye of Love’ (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Sept. 4) An omnivore’s dilemma. In this new musical adapted from a 1961 play by Arnold Weinstein, a young woman is torn between a handsome activist and a successful purveyor of meats. Ted Sperling directs this protein-packed comedy, with book by Mr. Weinstein and John Wulp and music by Sam Davis. Dicapo Opera Theater, St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, 212-868-4444, amasmusical.org. (Soloski) ‘Smoke’ (previews start on Friday; opens on Sept. 7) The playwright Kim Davies’s “sexual thriller” (think bondage, discipline and sadomasochism) at the Flea Theater involves a college student and an artist who meet at an erotic soirée. The resident company members Stephen Stout and Madeleine Bundy star; Tom Costello directs. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, 212-352-3101, theflea.org. (Soloski) ‘This Is Our Youth’ (in previews; opens on Sept. 11) Kenneth Lonergan, not so young anymore, has waited a long time for his Broadway debut. It arrives with a revival of his prickly, poignant 1996 play, set on the Upper West Side during the Reagan era. In this Steppenwolf production, directed by Anna D. Shapiro, Michael Cera, Kieran Culkin and Tavi Gevinson, the “Rookie” magazine editor, play three adolescent friends saddled with doubt, ennui and a stack of stolen cash. Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, thisisouryouthbroadway.com. (Soloski) ‘The Wayside Motor Inn’ (in previews; opens on Sept. 4) Signature Theater is focusing on two playwrights this season, Naomi Wallace and A.R. Gurney. Mr. Gurney’s latest, “The Wayside Motor Inn,” centers on 10 travelers idling in the same motel, just outside Boston. Lila Neugebauer, of the Mad Ones, directs a cast that includes Marc Kudisch, Lizbeth Mackay and Ismenia Mendes. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Soloski) ‘You Can’t Take It With You’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Sept. 28) James Earl Jones anchors a revival of Kaufman and Hart’s sparkling comedy about two households, not so alike in dignity. Scott Ellis directs a starry cast, which includes Elizabeth Ashley, Mark Linn-Baker, Kristine Nielsen, Annaleigh Ashford and Reg Rogers. Fran Kranz and Rose Byrne are the caste-crossed lovers. Expect pyrotechnics and the occasional kitten. Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, 212-239-6200, youcanttakeitwithyoubroadway.com. (Soloski) Broadway ‘Aladdin’ Casey Nicholaw (“The Book of Mormon”) directs and choreographs (and choreographs, and choreographs) the latest Disney musical, adapted from the 1992 animated movie. While the familiar formulas are not entirely abandoned, Mr. Nicholaw and the book writer, Chad Beguelin, stuff so much splashy, shticky business into this show that the more syrupy bits hardly register. James Monroe Iglehart stands out as the showboating, scene-stealing genie (2:20). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, 866-870-2717, aladdinthemusical.com. (Charles Isherwood) ‘Beautiful: The Carole King Musical’ This friendly, formulaic jukebox show about the New York-born singer-songwriter might as well be called “Brooklyn Girl,” so closely does it adhere to the template of the megahit “Jersey Boys” (about the Four Seasons). Jessie Mueller, though, is extraordinary as Ms. King, making us feel the connection between a singer and her songs (2:25). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley) ‘Cabaret’ Only a decade after it closed, Sam Mendes and Rob Marshall’s popular, audience-teasing reincarnation of this classic musical feels as if it never left us. Alan Cumming seems to be having the time of his life reprising the creepy, tragic M.C., a role he redefined for the ages. Michelle Williams appears somewhat less comfortable as the madcap Sally Bowles (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley) ★ ‘A Gentleman’s Guide to Love & Murder’ Playing eight different victims of a sweet-faced killer (Bryce Pinkham) in Edwardian England, Jefferson Mays sings, dances, prances and generally makes infectious merriment in this daffy, ingenious show, winner of the Tony Award for best musical. Written with real wit by Robert L. Freedman and Steven Lutvak, the show has been stylishly directed by Darko Tresnjak (2:20). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) ‘Hedwig and the Angry Inch’ Andrew Rannells is an “internationally ignored song stylist” of uncertain gender in John Cameron Mitchell’s and Stephen Trask’s 1998 rock musical about love, loss and crowd control. Michael Mayer directed this mightily entertaining, Tony Award-winning exercise (1:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, 212-239-6200, hedwigbroadway.com. (Brantley) ‘If/Then’ This new musical from Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey (“Next to Normal”) is a gleaming drawing board of a show, full of polished surfaces and clearly drawn lines. The shiny-voiced Idina Menzel portrays a conflicted urban planner pondering two different roads her life might have taken. The show feels less like a variation on a theme than a dogged reiteration of it (2:35). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, 877-250-2929, ifthenthemusical.com. (Brantley) ★ ‘Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill’ Audra McDonald scales her lustrous soprano down to jazz-soloist size to portray the great Billie Holiday in this concert-cum-solo-play by Lanie Robertson. Ms. McDonald’s terrific performance moves beyond mimicry to become a haunting portrait of a troubled artist who could only find equilibrium in her life when she lost herself in her music (1:30). Circle in the Square, 235 West 50th Street, 212-239-6200, ladydayonbroadway.com. (Isherwood) ‘Les Misérables’ It’s back — again. Capitalizing on the popular movie, Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil’s musical about the French fellow who steals a loaf of bread and lives to regret it storms Broadway in a new production. Ramin Karimloo, as the long-suffering bread-stealer, gives a sterling performance (2:50). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) Off Broadway ‘The Bullpen’ Joe Assadourian, who served 12 years in prison for attempted murder, wrote and stars in this very funny one-man show about the characters he met while awaiting his trial (1:05). Playroom Theater, 151 West 46th Street, 212-967-8278, stepinthebullpen.com. (Ken Jaworowski) ★ ‘50 Shades! The Musical’ When it comes to potential for satire, E.L. James’s she-porn best seller, “50 Shades of Grey,” seems as easy a target as you could shake a sex toy at. That said, this exuberant takeoff handily delivers the goods, barreling along with a score steeped in show tunes, R&B, gospel, Gilbert and Sullivan and lyrics packed with references to various practices and orifices. “This is real life; this isn’t a book,” says Ana, the show’s heroine, to her tycoon suitor. “If it was, it would be terrible.” It certainly would. But “50 Shades!” is a musical parody, and a very entertaining one (1:30). Elektra Theater, 300 West 43rd Street, Clinton, 212-352-3101, 50shadesthemusical.com. (Andy Webster) ‘The Good and the True’ The Czech director Daniel Hrbek twins testimony from Hana Pravda and Milos Dobry in this documentary drama. Little unites the actress Hana (Hannah D. Scott) and the athlete Milos (Saul Reichlin) except their Jewry and the horrors they suffered at Terezin and Auschwitz. The mingled monologues don’t enhance each other as much as they might, but both are compelling (1:20). DR2 Theater, 101 East 15th Street, 212-239-6200, goodandtrue.co.uk. (Soloski) ★ ‘Here Lies Love’ This invigorating poperetta, conceived by David Byrne, sets a new standard for audience participation. Or do I mean coercion? In this heady show about the heady life of Imelda Marcos, staged with infinite inventiveness by Alex Timbers, all the world’s a dance floor, and all the men and women (including the audience) merely disco rats (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley) ‘iLuminate’ More spectacle than story, “iLuminate” offers technology as its most dazzling star. Conceived, produced and directed by Miral Kotb, a former software engineer, the show employs about a dozen talented, indefatigable young actor-dancers, encased in black suits wired with digitally controlled lights. Performing in total darkness to a score combining hip-hop, jazz and classical influences, they portray the tale of an artist whose magic paintbrush is stolen for evil ends. Much of the action is like a neon comic book, but it does have its magic moments (:55). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, iluminate.com. (Laurel Graeber) ‘The Opponent’ In this well-acted but tepid boxing-world drama by Brett Neveu, a fighter on the rise (the vibrant Kamal Angelo Bolden) and his former trainer (Guy Van Swearingen) spar in the ring on the day of a big fight, and then have a more heated reckoning five years later (1:40). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Isherwood) ‘Pageant’ In this splashy and serviceable revival of the 1991 musical spoof of beauty contests (book by Bill Russell and Frank Kelly, music by Albert Evans), the evening-gowned and bathing-suited beauties are all played by men, and members of the audience crown the winner (1:25). Davenport Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) ‘Piece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story’ This gorgeously tuneful jukebox musical expertly taps songwriter Bert Berns’s voluminous catalog. With orchestra and cast giving fresh vibrancy and dimension to “Twist and Shout,” “I Want Candy” and other familiar songs, the show’s shortcomings — Daniel Goldfarb’s somewhat hokey book; Denis Jones’s direction, more focused on musical numbers than storytelling — matter less than they otherwise would (2:20). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-279-4200, pieceofmyheartmusical.com. (Laura Collins-Hughes) ‘Poor Behavior’ In Theresa Rebeck’s assertively glib comedy, two couples and several muffins disintegrate over the course of a country weekend. If you believed in these lives, these marriages, the comedy would feel more pointed, the drama more upsetting. Instead it’s merely irritating. The director, Evan Cabnet, and his cast try, but can’t make the play plausible (2:10). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 646-223-3010, primarystages.org. (Soloski) ‘Revolution in the Elbow of Ragnar Agnarsson Furniture Painter’ The Icelandic brothers Ivar Pall Jonsson and Gunnlaugur Jonsson make their musical theater debut with this quirky, great-looking but discombobulated satire about greed and economic collapse. The band sounds good blazing away in the corner, but with a cast of 12, including Cady Huffman, the show is so busy and unfocused that there’s no center for anyone to hold (2:00). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, 800-982-2787, revolutionelbow.com. (Collins-Hughes) ‘Sex Tips for Straight Women From a Gay Man’ Matt Murphy’s one-act is a blend of a bachelorette party at Chippendales and the embarrassing midnight show at some tourist trap in Pigalle. It has a talented cast, but it is no “Queer Eye” (1:20). 777 Theater, 777 Eighth Avenue, at 47th Street, 888-841-4111, sextipsplay.com. (Anita Gates) ★ ‘Sex With Strangers’ The steamy rapport between Anna Gunn (“Breaking Bad”) and Billy Magnussen (“Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike”) kindles a quick fire under Laura Eason’s timely, twisty drama about good sex, bad faith and the changing world of book (and digital) publishing (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, 212-246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood) ‘Summer Shorts: Series A’ Warren Leight’s sweetly despairing “Sec. 310, Row D, Seats 5 and 6,” about three Knicks fans wallowing in basketball catastrophe, is the highlight of this one-act series. Male friendship is also the subject of Roger Hedden’s “The Sky and the Limit,” while a mourning couple is the focus of Eric Lane’s “Riverbed” (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Soloski) ‘Summer Shorts: Series B’ This evening of new works features Daniel Reitz’s “Napoleon in Exile,” a tender, very funny short play about a young man “on the spectrum”; Neil LaBute’s compassionate, morally complex “The Mulberry Bush,” whose park-bench confrontation between strangers echoes “The Zoo Story”; and Albert Innaurato’s “Doubtless,” a slapdash spoof replete with cursing nuns, orgy-hosting priests and diatribes that don’t make good dialogue (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Collins-Hughes) ‘They Call Me Q’ This one-woman show follows an Indian immigrant as she comes to terms with America, her identity and her meddling parents (1:00).

(Jaworowski) Off Off Broadway ★ ‘Clown Bar’ This goofy but very funny homage to noir films and pulp novels finds a cop up against a crew of demented clowns (1:10). Saturdays at the Box, 189 Chrystie Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, pipelinetheatre.org. (Jaworowski) ‘Play/Date’ Best of luck listening in on the many intimate one-acts that make up this clever and frustrating show, which ponders connection and disconnection through the lens of bar-scene dating and technology. Written by 17 playwrights, it’s staged on three levels of a Lower East Side lounge. Intended as an immersive adventure, it is instead an obstacle-strewn exercise in thwarted acoustics (2:00). Fat Baby, 112 Rivington Street, at Essex Street, Lower East Side, playdateshow.com. (Collins-Hughes) Extravaganzas ‘Fuerza Bruta: Wayra’ The latest bit of sensory-overload brand extension from the creators of “De la Guarda” is a shiny, ever-shifting kinetic spectacle bent on disorientation. A high-volume, augmented remix of “Fuerzabruta,” this energetic show is rife with not-especially-impressive acrobatics, throbbing music, many-colored lights and high winds from machines set at storm speed (1:20). Daryl Roth Theater, 20 Union Square East, at 15th Street, 212-239-6200, fuerzabrutanyc.com. (Collins-Hughes) ‘Queen of the Night’ The latest and most lavish of this city’s immersive theater experiments includes cocktails, a meal and a circus-style floor show, in addition to any number of possible intimate, eroticism-tinged (but PG-13) encounters with the comely young cast members. The show is not for those prone to social anxiety, but it’s full of gaudy spectacle, with a fin-de-Bloomberg-era vibe (2:45).

Last Chance ★ ‘Between Riverside and Crazy’ (closes on Saturday) Stephen Adly Guirgis’s rich new play — about a man of many grudges in a rent-controlled apartment — resides somewhere south of cozy and north of dangerous, and it’s a dizzying and exciting place to be. Stephen McKinley Henderson leads a superb cast in embodying characters who are utterly believable and not to be believed. Austin Pendleton directs (2:00).

(Brantley) ‘Bullets Over Broadway: The Musical’ (closes on Sunday) This occasionally funny but mostly just loud adaptation of Woody Allen’s 1994 film, directed by Susan Stroman, features a score of 1920s standards and esoterica. If watching the movie was like being gently tickled into a state of hysteria, this musical version feels more like being head-butted by linebackers. Make that linebackers in blinding sequins (2:30).

(Jason Zinoman) ‘The Law of Return’ (closes on Sunday) Martin Blank’s political thriller is inspired by the real-life case of Jonathan Pollard, the American intelligence analyst who spied for Israel in the 1980s. Elise Thoron’s sleek staging accentuates the tension between Mr. Pollard’s life as an American Jew and his dream of a life in Israel, but his passion is harder to locate. The spy turns out to be the least likable and human of the play’s characters (1:20). Fourth Street Theater, 83 East Fourth Street, East Village, 800-838-3006, thelawofreturnplay.com. (Collins-Hughes) ‘The Lightning Thief’ (closes on Friday) This new musical, based on the popular young-adult novel, follows an unlikely sixth-grade hero as he battles monsters in a magical quest.

(Jaworowski) ‘The Long Shrift’ (closes on Saturday) Robert Boswell’s drama, which also marks James Franco’s directorial debut, concerns a young man imprisoned for the rape of a classmate, then freed when she recants. The play is untidy, annoying and sometimes ridiculous, yet rarely dull. By the end it has asked some troubling questions about whether or not we can ever put away past trauma, about whether or not we ever deserve to (1:35).

(Soloski) ‘Newsies’ (closes on Sunday) This Disney musical — adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 — markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, 866-870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley) ‘Phoenix’ (closes on Thursday) Scott Organ’s tentative, sentimental play is a romance of sorts between Julia Stiles’s self-protective Sue and James Wirt’s Bruce, the suitor who insists on tagging along to her abortion. The Rattlestick Theater has entrusted the script to the first-time theater director Jennifer DeLia. Her crude choices and the appalling design don’t help these opposites attract (1:20).

(Soloski) ★ ‘The Pianist of Willesden Lane’ (closes on Sunday) The classical pianist Mona Golabek portrays her mother, Lisa Jura — also a classical pianist — in this deeply affecting memoir-once-removed about Jura’s tumultuous youth in Vienna and London during World War II.
