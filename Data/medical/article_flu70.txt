"The reason people die from the flu is it hits the body so hard," Dr. John D. Nicolas, a clinical medicine instructor at Northwestern University and head of a seminar on prevention of colds and flu, said here Thursday. Dr. Walter Gunn, an epidemiologist at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said that "the most common misconception" about flu is "it's not serious." Most who succumb are the elderly or people with chronic health problems. They should be vaccinated now to be ready for the flu season, usually beginning in December, the doctors said. In some years flu claims twice the annual rate of 20,000. Holiday Increases Risk   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   "Because of people getting together for the Thanksgiving holiday, traveling from other places, spending a few days together inside the house, that's a perfect environment for spreading the virus around," said Mary Huck, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Public Health.

Victims develop fever, headache, muscle ache and fatigue. The vaccine is effective in 70 percent to 90 percent of people under the age of 65 and about half the people over 65, Dr. Gunn said. It can protect 85 percent of the elderly from dying of flu or its complications because its symptoms will be milder even if they catch it after getting the vaccine, he added.

The vaccine protects against the three strains of flu that the health authorities believe will be the most prevalent. It changes every year and the vaccine is good for one year. This year's strains are A Shanghai, A Taiwan and B Yamagata, Dr. Gunn said. The names are the same as the strains covered by last year's vaccine, but this year's A Shanghai is a slightly different subtype, he said. Who Should Be Vaccinated The Centers for Disease Control recommends flu vaccination for these groups of people: *Everybody over 65. *Anyone from 6 months to 65 years of age who has chronic heart or lung problems, all nursing home residents and people under regular medical care for diabetes, kidney ailments, compromised immunity (including infection with the virus that causes AIDS) or inherited blood disorders like sickle cell anemia. *Children under 18 receiving long-term aspirin therapy for arthritis of similar conditions. This recommendation is based on the rare but known link in children between aspirin, influenza and the development of Reye's syndrome, which can be fatal or cause permanent brain damage. *Doctors, nurses and others who deal with people in high-risk groups, employees in nursing homes and chronic health-care centers, providers of home care and household members of high-risk people. The centers said those who should avoid the vaccination include anyone allergic to eggs, because the vaccine is grown in chicken eggs, and anyone with a fever, until it subsides.
