Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here . What to expect from Powell’s first Fed meeting. Federal Reserve policymakers conclude their March rate-setting meeting on Wednesday. It is the first such session with Jerome H. Powell as the central bank’s new chairman. With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Here’s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting: Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs : “Public remarks by Fed officials suggest a broad shift in the committee’s outlook towards a potentially faster pace of tightening, and we expect the median dot to show four hikes in 2018, up from three at the December meeting. Additional hawkish changes—a move to three hikes in 2019 or an increase in the longer-run funds rate estimates—are also possible but not our base case.” Michelle Meyer , Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Ms. Meyer says she expects the Fed raise rates this meeting, but “unlike December where there were two dissents, we expect this decision to be unanimous given the shift in voters this year in the hawkish direction. The focus will be on the evolution of the dots: we look for the median to hold at three hikes for this year, but to shift up from two to three hikes in 2019. We also think the long-run dot will edge up to 2.875%. This would show a Fed that is more confident about its ability to deliver rate hikes, but without an urgency to front-load the tightening.” Ian Shepherdson , Pantheon Macroeconomics : Mr. Powell “is bound to be faced with questions along the lines of “Why are you not raising the dots in the wake of the substantial, unfunded fiscal easing?”. His reply, we suspect, will be something like: “It’s not our job to tell Congress how to conduct fiscal policy, and it’s too soon to assess the impact of the tax cuts and spending increases. Much of the easing of policy could be saved rather than spent, and there are encouraging signs that productivity is picking up, so any upturn in wage growth as a result of fiscal loosening need not necessarily generate higher inflation. In any event, with inflation well below target, gradual normalization is the best way to balance the risks of both future inflation and the premature ending of the cycle via excessive tightening.” Stephen Stanley,  Amherst Pierpont: “The bulk of the interest in this week’s F.O.M.C. meeting will come from the updated dot and economic projections as well as any meaningful tweaks to the key elements of the F.O.M.C. statement. Any changes to the dots and statement language are likely to be in the hawkish direction, though I would expect that the new information will be more evolutionary than a radically different.” Steve Rick, CUNA Mutual Group: There is “a very strong case for not only raising rates this week, but potentially doing so in a more aggressive manner than previously forecasted at the end of 2017. I think we could see projections get updated to call for four hikes instead of three, with plans for lifting rates more in coming years as well.” Chris Zaccarelli ,  Independent Advisor Alliance : “Whether we have 3 or 4 rate hikes this year shouldn’t be that big of a difference to the economy, but it WILL have a big impact on market prices and market psychology. Every statement – whether spoken or written – will be highly scrutinized looking for clues as to whether the Fed Funds rate will be 1% higher (or only 75 bps) a year from now.”  Photo        Steven Mnuchin last month in Washington.

Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times    Trump, tariffs and the G20 President Trump’s plan to hit countries around the world with stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum has dominated a gathering of world economic leaders amid fears that the United States is on the cusp of starting an international trade war.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   On Monday, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs, which are being imposed in the name of national security. In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced “relatively quickly.” Mr. Mnuchin said: “I think we’ve been very transparent in describing our positions; I don’t think anything should be a surprise. This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.” Mr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions. But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States’ national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits. Countries including France, Argentina and South Korea pressed Mr. Mnuchin on Monday about being freed from the metals tariffs, arguing that, as United States allies, they should not be penalized on national security grounds . Mr. Mnuchin said that decisions were being made on a case-by-case basis and that there was not a one-size-fits-all approach to deciding which countries would be exempt. The tariffs go into effect on Friday. — Alan Rappeport  Photo        Facebook shares dropped nearly 7 percent Monday, and its chief information security officer, Alex Stamos, plans to leave over a dispute over transparency.   Credit Beck Diefenbach/Reuters    Pressure continues to mount on Facebook. The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency on data privacy, reports Cecilia Kang of the NYT . The probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry. The investigation, started in recent days, adds to the mounting pressure against Facebook in the United States and in the United Kingdom about its handling of the data. Cambridge Analytica used the information to help President Trump’s presidential campaign profile voters during the 2016 election. The F.T.C. and Facebook reached a settlement in 2011 after the agency accused the company of deceiving customers “by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,” according to a statement at the time.

Shares of Facebook are down 2.5 percent in early trading. Facebook’s worst day in ages Exhibit A: Its stock closed down nearly 7 percent, its worst performance in four years . Exhibit B: Its chief security officer, Alex Stamos, plans to leave after disagreements about how much the company should share about misuse of its platform. (He favored disclosure.) The overall problem: Reports about how the data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from 50 million Facebook users are highlighting just how much governments itch to regulate the tech giant. And Facebook’s previous laissez-faire attitude toward data collection by apps has gone from feature to bug , Kevin Roose writes in his latest column. Peter Eavis’s take: Mark Zuckerberg’s unusually powerful position at the company may have played a role : Through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security. More on Cambridge Analytica: An undercover investigation by Channel 4 News of Britain captured the firm’s C.E.O., Alexander Nix, suggesting the entrapment of a potential client’s political opponents with women and bribes. Britain’s information commissioner is now seeking a warrant to examine the firm’s data. And Facebook has hired a forensics firm to audit it. Critics’ corner • Jeff Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes, “Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his start-up into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.” • The academic Zeynep Tufekci writes, “This wasn’t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   • Cass Sunstein of Bloomberg View writes, “It would be a mistake to take the fiasco as a reason to keep treasure troves of information out of the hands of people who can provide immensely valuable services with it.” • Dan Gallagher of Heard on the Street writes, “Facebook’s immense scale also has made it virtually impossible for alternatives to catch on. That, in turn, makes abuse of the platform more urgent for lawmakers.” Public service announcements: How to protect yourself on Facebook .
