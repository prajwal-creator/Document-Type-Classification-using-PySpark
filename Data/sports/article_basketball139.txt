The win, which included Marcelo Huertas’s missing two free throws with three and a half seconds remaining, essentially clinched Group B for the Americans, who are 3-0.

It was great. We’re very happy for what we did.” The United States was too reliant on one-on-one play, was lazy on defense in the first half and got virtually nothing from the bench in the first half. In the fourth quarter, the United States made one field goal in the final 6 minutes 50 seconds. “We can’t worry about how much we win by or winning in the same fashion that other USA Basketball teams  all that is out the window,” said Chauncey Billups, who had 15 points. “All we have to do is get wins.” For Coach Mike Krzyzewski, the victory showed him that he has a team with enough character to eke out a win when it lacked energy. And for an American team light on experience, Billups showed that he could take over stretches of the game.

Terrill/Associated Press    “The guys look for me to be me,” Billups said. “Especially in games like this.” Billups scored what proved to be the winner with an impressive driving layup in which he drew contact from the 7-footer Tiago Splitter, held his composure and banked in a shot with 52 seconds remaining. That bucket provided the United States’ only field goal down the stretch. The Americans were also aided by errant Brazilian shooters, who missed their final seven 3-point attempts, many wide open. “I don’t know until you’re in these situations if you’re going to have the character to win when you can’t hit a shot,” Krzyzewski said. “Tonight, I found that.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When a tight game developed, many Americans looked as if they would be more comfortable on a different continent. They moved on offense as if they wore cement sneakers (eight assists over all). “It was a little stagnant tonight,” Billups said. “We don’t condone that.” Andre Iguodala played 29 minutes without a field goal, and his only shot was an embarrassing miss of an unguarded layup early in the fourth quarter. He led a roll call of offensive no-shows: Iguodala, Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gay, Eric Gordon and Tyson Chandler combined for 62 minutes without a field goal, shooting 0 for 6 from the field.

When a reporter asked Iguodala about not scoring a field goal in 29 minutes, he responded, “You from Philly?” Iguodala, of the 76ers, said: “I wasn’t frustrated; I know my role on this team. The main thing is that we got the win. I had a job, which is make it tough for Barbosa to score.” Brazil led by as many as 8 points and controlled the game until midway though the third quarter. Then Billups began to take over, driving at will and drawing contact, scoring or dishing for easy layups. “He’s the leader of this team; we have to follow him,” said Durant, who turned the ball over seven times. The Americans have a day off before their final two games of pool play, which are essentially dunk contests against Iran and Tunisia. The knockout round will start Saturday. And no matter how one spins things, the Americans are destined for some drama once the competition tightens up.
