In contrast, just a small portion of people infected with hepatitis B, which also causes hepatitis, go on to become chronic carriers. But a second study provides some reassurance, indicating that for the first 20 years after infection the death rate in people with hepatitis C may be no higher than that in similar but uninfected people. The finding indicates that the virus can be extraordinarily indolent even though it is a leading cause of cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer in this country. The new research, by Dr. Miriam J. Alter of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Leonard B. Seeff of the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Washington and their colleagues, is being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. Hepatitis experts say the studies help flesh out an emerging picture of a silent epidemic that is only now becoming appreciated.

'Poorly Reported Disease'  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as many as 150,000 Americans are infected each year with hepatitis C, and that 8,000 to 10,000 die each year from consequences of the infection. But, Dr. Alter said, "it's a very poorly reported disease and it's extremely difficult to come up with accurate estimates." Dr. Seeff said that the usual estimates almost certainly understated the disease's prevalence because they were derived from studies of blood donors and that hepatitis C was most common among poor people, who do not often donate blood, and intravenous drug users, who are not permitted to donate. Since 1990, blood has been screened for evidence of the virus. At his own hospital, Dr. Seeff said, 40 percent of the people admitted had hepatitis C, although almost none of them knew it. "I believe that hepatitis C is a tremendously common disease and that we have not known about it, " Dr. Seeff said. "We are seeing the tip of an iceberg." Dr. Alter said, "According to this study, once you get it, you can't get rid of it." Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood and shared needles, but, Dr. Alter found in her study, about 40 percent of people who become infected say they never used drugs or were exposed to infected blood. It may also be transmitted through sexual intercourse, researchers say, but if it is, the likelihood of getting infected that way is very low. "We've never been able to figure out how all these people became infected," Dr. Dienstag said. The only treatment for Hepatitis C is with the immune system hormone alpha interferon, but just 25 percent of patients respond without relapsing. The treatment requires six months of injections three times a week, costs about $75 a week and has unpleasant side effects like flu-like symptoms, fatigue and irritability. Although liver functioning improves in those who respond to the alpha interferon treatment, Dr. Alter said, it is not known whether the treatment eradicates the virus.

She and her colleagues found, she said, that "the virus remained through the four years that we tested for it."

Dr. Alter said that she and her colleagues fully expected that the hepatitis C virus, like the hepatitis B virus, would be gone when the patients' liver functions were back to normal. "We were taken by surprise" by the finding, she said. In their study, Dr. Seeff and his colleagues analyzed data from five large studies of the 1970's that had identified patients who had had blood transfusions and become infected with what was later discovered to be hepatitis C. The researchers tracked the patients who died and asked whether the cause of death had been hepatitis C infections or other causes. Dr. Seeff said he predicted that after 20 years the patients who were infected with the hepatitis C virus would be dying at a faster rate. He said he found it encouraging that his prediction was not borne out, although the hepatitis C patients did have a higher death rate from liver disease. "I don't believe this is a benign disease," Dr. Seeff said, adding that he was now gathering data on the state of health of those who have lived with hepatitis C infections for the past two decades and also was continuing to study death rates for another five years. "It may simply be a question of time," Dr. Seeff said. "It may be that as we proceed, we will find that problems will develop and people will die of this disease as time goes on." Dr. Ira Jacobson, a hepatitis expert at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, said he too did not believe that hepatitis C infections were benign. Even if most infected people will die of other causes, some are devastated by the virus, he said. "I see so many patients who get in trouble with this virus," Dr. Jacobson said. "We are seeing patients with cirrhosis and with liver cancer. We used to call the cirrhosis of unknown cause, but now we recognize it's due to hepatitis C. And we are coming to recognize in this country that liver cancer may more commonly arise from hepatitis C than from hepatitis B." But, Dr. Dienstag said, at the very least Dr. Seeff's findings "allow us to breathe a little bit easier."

But, in fact, there is a population of people who do fairly well. We all feel this is encouraging."    We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
