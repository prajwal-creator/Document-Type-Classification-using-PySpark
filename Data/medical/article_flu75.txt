Clinical results, announced last month at the Fifth International Conference on Lyme Disease and the Lyme bacteria in Arlington, Va., indicate that a new test for the disease is much more sensitive than the currently available standard tests and that many more people may have Lyme disease than are now found to have it. Most people with the disease recover without lasting problems. When the disease is detected early, it can be successfully treated with antibiotics. But if the disease is left undiagnosed and untreated, a few patients can suffer chronic joint pain, vision and heart problems and other symptoms. Hope for Early Diagnoses And as parents' fears about this problematic disease grow, many are keeping their children inside during the summer.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Indirect tests that are now available detect antibodies, proteins produced by the human body's immune response to the bacteria, rather than the bacteria themselves. Because different people's immune systems react differently to the disease, the tests can be unreliable. The new direct assay detects protein-rich materials, or bioproducts, shed by the active bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Dr. David Dorward, a senior staff fellow at the allergy institute, who was one of the main researchers involved with developing the new test, said researchers were particularly interested in these bioproducts because they, rather than the bacteria, might actually cause many of the symptoms of the disease. So far, researchers have used the test successfully in the laboratory to detect infection in ticks, mice and dogs as well as people. Commercial Partners Sought Dr. Jane A. Biddle, patenting and licensing manager at the allergy institute, said that a patent was pending on the test and that the National Institutes of Health, which include the allergy institute, were actively seeking out pharmaceutical companies to participate as commercial partners in developing the test and making it available to the public. Biotechnology patents take an average of three years to be reviewed, and the new test has been under review for nearly two years. Once a patent has been approved and a commercial partner is licensed, the test will need to gain approval of the Food and Drug Administration before it is finally available to the public. Dr. Biddle said it was impossible to predict how long that would take. Dr. Kenneth B. Liegner, an internist from Armonk, N.Y., who provided clinical samples for testing, said the new clinical results on the urine of 70 patients suspected of having Lyme disease confirmed clinicians' suspicions that many more people had the illness than were testing positive with currently available tests. "We found that there were a large number of people who tested negative on all the routine tests but who tested positive on the new tests," Dr. Liegner said. "These were people who came to me because they had symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease. It suggests that far higher numbers of people may be infected than we'd thought previously."

But the newer test did appear to be more sensitive, detecting more cases. Of Dr. Liegner's 70 patients, 57 patients tested positive on at least one of the tests. The new direct test detected Lyme disease bacteria in 42 of the 57, while the older tests detected the disease in 31. Dr. Joseph Burrascano, who presented clinical results at a meeting in April sponsored by the National Lyme Disease Foundation, said: "It's absolutely a better test than those available now. There's no question about it." Dr. Burrascano is an internist in East Hampton, L.I., who works with many Lyme disease patients and also contributed patient urine samples for the clinical tests. Dr. Liegner said, "This is a very, very important breakthrough, since up until now we've had to depend on very indirect methods of diagnosis." In some patients, detection of a response may be impossible with the current tests because their immune systems have been weakened or because a genetic deficiency prevents them from mounting a strong antibody response. Another problem with the standard tests is that because of the variety of bacterial strains that cause Lyme disease, there can be a great variety of human immune reactions to the different strains. This variation makes it impossible to know whether a negative result means that the patient is not infected or that response to that particular strain was not detectable by the test. As a result, doctors must rely on clinical symptoms and patient history. The classic response to Lyme disease is a bull's-eye rash, flu-like symptoms and possibly arthritis-like inflammation of the joints. But Dr. Liegner said that the clinical tests confirmed that Lyme disease, often called the "the great imitator," could make diagnosis difficult by presenting a wide variety of symptoms. When tests produce negative results, doctors are faced with weighing the risk of forgoing treatment against that of providing unnecessary treatment to patients, some of whom may be in poor health.

But the bacteria do shed protein-covered pieces of the outer sheath, called blebs, and other materials, which are detected by the new test. In the newly developed test, a copper grid is coated with a protein that that can bind to other proteins, including those produced by the Lyme disease bacteria. When the grid is exposed to a sample of body fluids, like urine, spinal fluid, blood, joint fluids or samples of internal organs, bacterial proteins in the samples can bind to the grid. In the final stage, the scientists use a third protein to detect the presence of the captured Lyme disease bacterial protein. Other Experimental Tests Other direct and indirect tests are being developed by other research groups. One test exploits a new molecular biology technique called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R. Rather than detecting proteins produced by the bacteria, P.C.R. detects the DNA of the bacteria itself. According to Dr. Dorward, the P.C.R. and antigen capture/detection assays have not yet been directly compared in laboratory tests. Like the antigen capture/detection assay, the P.C.R. test is continuing to be studied in laboratory tests. Dr. Robert Craven, chief of the epidemiology section at the Centers for Disease Control at Fort Collins, Colo., Lyme disease has been reported in every state except Montana, although reports from four of those states are thought to be cases of mistaken diagnosis or disease contracted elsewhere. More than 40,000 cases of Lyme disease have been reported since 1982, with more than 80 percent from 10 states: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Wisconsin and California.
