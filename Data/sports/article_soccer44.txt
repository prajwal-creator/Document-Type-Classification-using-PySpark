His team, needing to beat Iraq to book a debut appearance at the tournament, was leading 1-0 in Doha, Qatar. The clock had run down to 45 seconds when Iraq’s Jaffar Omran Salman scored to tie the game and break the hearts of an entire nation. The Agony of Doha will never be forgotten, and Japan likes to get it done early these days. It was the first team to qualify for the 2006 and 2010 World Cups, and will do so for the third straight time if it defeats Jordan in Amman on Tuesday — but a draw could be enough depending on what happens elsewhere. As a fifth consecutive World Cup comes into view however, it is no longer about how soon the Samurai Blue secures its place but how long it stays there. In the past two decades, Japan has gone from strength to strength. The J.League is 20 years old and widely regarded as the best in Asia. The national team’s first World Cup appearance in 1998 may have resulted in three defeats, but it was another step. Four years later, Japan was a co-host and in the second round — a feat repeated in 2010 when only a penalty shootout prevented it from reaching the quarterfinals.

In October, a largely European-based team defeated France in Paris, and in March, Shinji Kagawa of Manchester United became the first Asian to score a hat-trick in the English Premier League.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Philippe Troussier took Japan to the last 16 of the 2002 tournament and believes that reaching the knockout stages of the World Cup is now the least of the team’s ambitions. “To qualify is now a formality; this is where Japan expects to be,” the Frenchman said. “Japan is not the naïve team that some people in Europe continue to believe. “Many of Japan’s players are playing regularly in the best European leagues. This helps to make the team mature and experienced to add to its unity, discipline, intelligence, speed, and skill,” Troussier continued. “I consider Japan to be now one of the top 15 teams in the world.” Japanese players are a common sight in the German Bundesliga and the English Premier League, and more will most likely be on their way in the near future — Arsenal coach Arsène Wenger recently declared that Japan was a major new market for top talent. “Japan has developed a long-term vision, strategy and invested heavily in the grass-roots,” said Afshin Ghotbi, head coach Shimizu S-Pulse in the J.League and a former coach of Iran, a onetime Asian rival that is now struggling to keep pace with Japan. “This commitment to education, infrastructure, and development has been the key to the success of Japanese soccer and the production of young talent. Japan will arrive in Brazil organized, united and ambitious.”  Photo        Eyong Enoh of Cameroon, left, and Keisuke Honda of Japan, right, during a World Cup match in South Africa in 2010.

Kagawa may have won two German titles with Borussia Dortmund before his lucrative transfer to Manchester United and may now be the biggest star in Asian soccer, but he does not usually get to play where he wants for the national team. His favored central position behind the striker is usually given to Keisuke Honda. Honda, a star of the 2010 World Cup who plays for CSKA Moscow, is constantly linked to some of the biggest clubs in Europe but will miss the Jordan game because of an injury. So will Inter Milan wing-back Yuto Nagatomo. Still, with the team’s strength in depth, it should not have a problem in Amman. Japan thrashed Jordan 6-0 earlier in the final round of qualification, where Japan had four victories and one draw, against Australia. With 13 goals scored and just two conceded, the team has been dominant in Group B, from which the top two of five qualify automatically for Brazil. Australia is eight points behind in second, though it has played one game fewer.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Zaccheroni is a conductor, making sure that the musicians are in the right place at the right time.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Australia was expected to compete with Japan for the top spot, but finishing second is just as good: The Socceroos started poorly with two points from the first three games but picked up a vital win against Iraq in October to move into second place. With three of the four remaining games to be played at home and with Oman, Jordan and Iraq all dropping points to one other as well as to Japan, Australia can still be confident of a third consecutive appearance at the World Cup. In Group A, South Korea is looking for an eighth consecutive appearance. After a good start, the 2002 semifinalist has stumbled and is level with Iran and Qatar at seven points. Uzbekistan is top, with eight. The Taeguk Warriors have played a game fewer than the others and play three of their remaining four games at home. There is still tension in Seoul, however, and that was not helped by a   4-0 loss to Croatia in a February friendly. With a team containing players from the English Premier League and the Bundesliga, the host has the talent to defeat Qatar in Seoul on Tuesday. Failure to do so would raise the serious prospect of a first World Cup without a South Korean presence since 1982. But the players will not give up. Even if not all remember, everyone knows about the Miracle of Doha, when a last-minute goal from an Iraqi striker sent South Korea to the 1994 World Cup just when all seemed lost.
