Her sister, Suddenley, is 11, not 9. • An article last Sunday about a mechanized book-sorting competition between two library systems misstated, in some editions, the name of a library system serving the Seattle region. It is the King County Library System, not the King County Public Library. The article also described incorrectly in some editions the area served by the system. It serves the area surrounding Seattle; it does not have branches in the city itself. (The city is served by the Seattle Public Library, which is not involved in the sorting contest.) The error about serving Seattle was repeated in the headline in some editions. SPORTS An article on Nov. 1 about the Giants’ connections to New Orleans misstated the name of the school that quarterback Eli Manning and receiver Odell Beckham Jr. attended there. It is Isidore Newman School, not Isidore Newman High School. WEEKEND Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Friday with a review of a play at New World Stages in Manhattan misspelled part of the title. As the review correctly noted, the play is “Shear Madness,” not “Sheer Madness.” SPECIAL SECTION: GIVING An answer in a Q&A column last Sunday with Marc Benioff, founder of Salesforce.com, about the strategic benefits of corporate giving, described incorrectly the company’s Pledge 1% program. It is an initiative led by Salesforce; it is not a foundation. • An article last Sunday about tax pitfalls of charitable giving misstated the value threshold for donations of property requiring the completion of Section B of I.R.S. Form 8283. It is more than $5,000, not $5,000 or more. The article also misstated the possible tax consequences of donating stock in a closely held business that is about to be sold. Waiting until the sale is a certainty could result in a reduced tax benefit, not strictly a deduction limited to the cost, or basis, of the shares. T: MEN’S STYLE A picture caption on Sept. 13 with an article about the film director James Ivory and his home in the Hudson Valley referred incorrectly to the fabric in a 1700s Indian coverlet shown in his guest bedroom. The fabric was made in the town of Palampur, not Palamur. BUSINESS A picture caption last Sunday with an article about winemaking in China misidentified a winery in Ningxia, China. It is Château Changyu Moser XV, not Château Moser. • The What You Get article on the Real Estate pages in some editions last Sunday, about houses for sale for about $3 million, misspelled the web address of Coldwell Banker Burnet, the agency listing a house in Minneapolis. It is birkelandburnet.com . MAGAZINE An article on Oct. 18 about lullabies used an incorrect music term to describe Western lullabies. These songs often have a 6/8 meter, not 6/8 tempo. • An interview on Oct. 25 with the musician and actress Carrie Brownstein described incorrectly the affiliation of a drummer named C.J. Phillips. He was a member of Brownstein’s previous band, not the band of her current bandmate Corin Tucker. • An article on Oct. 25 about litigation finance misstated the amount of money managed by the firm Gerchen Keller. It has more than $840 million under management, not $475 million in private capital. ARTS & LEISURE An article last Sunday about the new Beatles video collection “1” misstated the name of the label that released it. It is Apple Corps Ltd./UMG, not Apple/UMG Records. The article also misstated the year of the Beatles’ “rooftop concert.” It was 1969, not 1970. • An article last Sunday about the movie “Jim Henson’s Turkey Hollow,” using information from Lifetime, which will air the film on Nov. 21, misstated the name of one of the puppets in the movie. It is Thrinng, not Thwring. The error was repeated in a picture caption. • An article last Sunday about the new movie “Trumbo,” which focuses on the Hollywood blacklist, misspelled the given name of Louis B. Mayer’s right-hand man at MGM. He was Dore Schary, not Dory. • An article on Nov. 1 about the new Broadway musical “Allegiance,” inspired by the actor George Takei’s memories of life in an internment camp in World War II, referred incorrectly to people of Japanese descent who were sent to internment camps during World War II. While about 120,000 people were interned, only about two-thirds of them were American citizens; they were not all American citizens. TRAVEL Because of an editing error, a picture caption last Sunday with an article about a food tour of Chicago misidentified a dish at Isla Pilipina, a Filipino restaurant. It is kare-kare, not paksiwna lechon. • The cover article last Sunday, about a road trip in Northern Alaska, misidentified the type of trees found around the Yukon River Camp. They are spruce trees — not fir, which are not found in that area. • The Check In column last Sunday, about the Urso Hotel & Spa in Madrid, misspelled the name of a neighborhood in the city. It is Cham-berí, not Chamerbí. REAL ESTATE The Mortgages column last Sunday, about renters who are not rushing to buy homes, gave an incorrect percentage from TD Bank for the down payment it requires for its first-time buyer program for low- to moderate-income households. It is 3 percent, not 2 percent. • An article last Sunday about the artist Zhang Hongtu described incorrectly an artwork on display in a survey of Mr. Zhang’s work at the Queens Museum. It is a print of “Last Banquet,” not the original work. SUNDAY STYLES An article last Sunday about Twitter’s decision to change its star function to a heart described incompletely the origin of the method to change Twitter’s heart icon to a beer one. Although it was posted on Gizmodo.com, the technique was originally written and posted to Twitter by Robert A. McNees, a physics professor from Loyola University Chicago. • Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about a new cafe in Manhattan where patrons pay $15 an hour to mingle with cats, misstated the age of the cafe’s owner, Benjamin Kalb. He is 26, not 25. The article also misspelled, in one reference, the name of the cafe. As noted elsewhere, it is Koneko, not Konoko. • A caption last Sunday on the Evening Hours page misidentified a guest shown receiving a Literary Lion award from the New York Public Library on Nov. 2. He is Alan Bennett, not Charles Gross. OPINION Because of an editing error, an essay last Sunday in The End misstated how long the health of the writer’s mother had been failing before she and her husband decided to commit suicide. It was several months, not five years. The Times welcomes comments and suggestions, or complaints about errors that warrant correction.
