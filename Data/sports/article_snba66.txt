By NANCY DONIGER APRIL 15, 2001     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           SARA JERUSS, 17, a senior at Masuk High School in Monroe, fights to stay awake every morning during her first period physics class. She often finds she has to teach herself from books on weekends, having missed the fine points of lectures while fending off fatigue. ''On a regular day, I enter class clutching my coffee, fighting to wake up, so I don't miss the notes on the board,'' she said. ''Even my teacher has said this class is the hardest, for him and for us, it being so early and everyone being so tired.'' Across Connecticut, public high school students start school early, at about 7:30. Doctors and education experts said this leaves the students battling fatigue, often paying a steep price for their sleep deprivation, ranging from poor academic performance, depression and driving accidents. There is such concern over the issue that Kevin B. Sullivan, the State Senate's Democratic president pro tem, has proposed a bill in the State Legislature that would make high school start times no earlier than 8:30 a.m. Mr. Sullivan, who represents West Hartford, Bloomfield, Burlington and Farmington, said there had been ''a crescendo of observations of kids in my town, including the young lady next door, waiting for the bus in the dark and the cold, whom I would greet each morning when I went out to get my newspaper. Here I was, an adult, but not expected to start my work day. And there she was, a teenager, and expected to start her day against her body clock.''

He also found later sleep times have been pioneered with positive results in Minnesota and Virginia. When a group of West Hartford parents presented a request to start school later to the local Board of Education, which dismissed it, he said he realized any change would have to be implemented statewide.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dr. Kishore Ranade of Ridgefield, a neurologist who has a background in studying adolescent sleep disorders, said teenagers were biologically programmed to fall asleep later and get up later than adults. ''It's a unique feature in adolescence,'' Dr. Ranade said. ''Their brain cycle is not mature. We think this is partly because adolescents need more hormones for growth, and growth hormones are secreted in the brain during sleep.'' He said adolescents needed about nine hours of sleep a night. Since most teenagers go to bed at 11 p.m. or later, in accordance with the adolescent brain clock, and get awakened at 6 a.m., they are going to school in the latter third of their sleep cycle, he said. ''No wonder they act like zombies -- they are,'' he said. ''Just as you would not have adults schedule important decision-making at 4 a.m., your teenager is also half asleep until 8 a.m.'' Ms. Jeruss said going to bed earlier did not help. ''I'm not sleepy enough to fall asleep until 11, 11:30 p.m.,'' she said. ''It's not that I have too much homework and activities. I have good time management skills and can get my work done, even with a part-time job. I just can't fall asleep earlier.'' Andrew Almeida, 16, a junior at Hall High School in West Hartford, said he would also like to get more sleep because he believed it would improve his school work. ''It has been my experience that coming into school later, whether it be due to delayed opening, having first period free, or simply my exhaustion from lack of sleep, improves my ability to concentrate during school and actually comprehend and absorb information,'' he said.

''School used to start about 20 minutes later, and even that made a difference,'' she said. ''There used to be homeroom, which made a nice transition at the start of the day. Now daily homeroom has been eliminated to allow more time for instruction. Morning meetings take the place of homeroom, but they only take place occasionally.'' Getting an extra hour of sleep at night would make a huge difference to academic performance, according to Alex Sinanis, 16, a sophomore at Guilford High School. ''When you get a lot of homework and tests to study for, it's hard to go to bed on time to get enough sleep,'' he said. ''All the kids complain about it. When we have to get up that early, we don't even have time to eat breakfast.'' Paula J. Newman of Mansfield, whose daughter, Kathleen, 15, attends Edwin O. Smith High School, has approached her local school district about implementing a change. ''Our town prides itself on the level of education it provides, but we are hypocritical when we ignore the scientific findings that our children need more sleep,'' Ms. Newman said.

''Some of our kids are on the bus at 6 in the morning,'' said Paul Brody, chairman of the Region 19 Board of Education. ''We know this is a problem because they are exhausted and we're looking for a way to solve it.'' Colleen Palmer, the principal of Hamden High School, said she and many other high school principals philosophically supported the idea that starting an hour later will improve student learning. ''Over the past decade, many districts have increased instructional time, moving school start times earlier, mostly to coordinate with busing,'' she said. ''By starting school too early, we are losing the opportunity to teach students when they are the most alert.''

It turns out that changing school hours would have a domino effect on so much. After-school activities, such as sports or jobs, would begin and end later, working parents who rely on their teenagers to care for younger siblings after school would have to make other arrangements, and there would be a shortage of school buses. In many towns buses do double, triple duty, first picking up high school students, then making runs to the middle and elementary schools. So transportation companies would have to buy more buses, an expense many towns said they couldn't afford. At a public hearing in February on Mr. Sullivan's bill, the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference opposes the measure because the association, representing 1,200 schools, believes it requires further study, said Mike Savage, the executive director of the group. ''Our organization has taken the position we're not going to oppose the bill on the basis of interscholastic athletics,'' he said. ''We opposed it because it requires further study and appropriate funding. We believe more research has to be done and reviewed, and that it may not result in the same findings as Mr. Sullivan found. We're taking a more global position, looking at the value of getting more sleep against the effect it could have on after-school activities, internships and extended day work study programs.'' The Connecticut Association of Schools said the start of the school day should be a local prerogative and not a state mandate. ''Basically, we agree it would be nice to have high schools start later, but there are costs that have to taken into account,'' said Thomas Galvin, assistant executive director of the association. ''The question is whether the benefits of a later start time outweigh the negatives. We can't figure out how it could be done without more buses at $35,000 each.'' Thomas Murphy, spokesman for the State Department of Education, said he supported starting school later, but also favored more study to consider not only bus rotations but parental work schedules and other factors. Such a sweeping change would affect 160,000 students in 166 school districts around the state, he said. Robert Rader, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education called Mr. Sullivan's proposal ''very interesting. It's something we're willing to look at as a voluntary thing for school districts to do. Our primary concern has to do with logistics, extracurricular activities and financial support for extra buses.'' Mr. Sullivan has referred his bill to the General Assembly's Education Committee for further study and said he would like to see negotiations take place, leading to a voluntary, versus mandated phase-in statewide.

Gaffey, the cochairman of the Education Committee and a Democrat of Middletown, Middlefield and Meriden, said he didn't see why a later high school start time should increase the need for more school buses, or why this couldn't be negotiated as a business agreement between the school districts and bus companies. However, he also said he doesn't want to minimize the challenges of bus scheduling if start times change. Mr. Gaffey said he would like to institute a test study of later high school start times by September 2002, beginning with the higher grades, to see how well it works. State funding might be available for more buses if it turns out more are needed, he said. State Representative Patricia Shea, a Republican of Monroe and part of Newtown, said although adolescents would benefit from more sleep, if the state decides it is a good idea to change start times, the State Legislature must also find a way to pay for it. ''If Monroe and Newtown are mandated to buy more buses, without the legislature figuring out a way to make it happen financially, I can't support it,'' she said. Ms. Jeruss, the Masuk High School senior, said she hoped her hours were changed. ''I've seen many things written about how we're a nation of sleep-deprived workaholics, and how the sleep-deprivation causes the loss of many hours of productivity, as well as many automobile accidents,'' she said. ''Put that way, it seems to me that encouraging students to work just a little bit less and sleep a little bit more certainly isn't a bad thing.''
