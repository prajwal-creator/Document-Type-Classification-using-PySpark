As fast as you can say, ''pass the $40 million construction bond,'' a school can sprout a new wing or two. But when it comes to, say, the basketball team, there are still only five starting positions and no matter how much money you throw at the problem, the school can't sprout a sixth. Likewise, no matter how much money a community is willing to pay on a bond, that community won't have more than one varsity soccer team and you can't carry hundreds of students on the one you have. School enrollments are rising, and that has meant ever-increasing numbers of athletes. This leaves officials wedged somewhere between yearning to keep rosters manageable and hesitating to cut students who just want to play. Among the results have been frayed nerves among athletes and parents -- as well as changes in the scope of the school athletic director's job, as the director works to placate frustrations, route athletes to alternative sports with larger rosters and add new sports, all the while building up college-style intramural offerings for those cut from the varsity. ''For one of our teams,'' said Jim Capalbo, the athletic director of Brewster Central Schools, ''we wanted to keep all the kids, so we went out and bought extra uniforms. I went to a game and one parent said they loved the decision that everyone could get a chance to play. Then I walked two feet more and a parent said, 'This is terrible, we shouldn't have all these girls.'''

The decision, of course, goes beyond whether to invest in uniforms and take all comers. In many sports, top-heavy rosters make practices difficult to manage and fundamentals hard to teach. Also, big rosters simply don't mask the fact that playing time can't be sliced perfectly, like a pie.

But in soccer that doesn't work, because only 11 play.'' In the last two years at Brewster, the number of players on the boys tennis team has tripled. Girls' lacrosse, recently created, has attracted 90 players among modified, varsity and junior varsity. Other districts offer similar examples -- so many tried out for the freshman boys' soccer team in Chappaqua this fall that players were given numbers that ranked their likelihood of playing.

Mr. McGuckin is looking toward the college model, where many play competitively in intramurals. At night and during lunch, students can be found playing everything from intramural soccer to basketball (both 3-on-3 and 5-on-5), table tennis, flag football and something called pickleball, which Mr. McGuckin describes as indoor tennis with wood paddles. ''We have a lot more moving parts these days,'' he said, ''with more kids, the parameters have changed and athletics have expanded beyond what I ever thought they could.'' To help him, the school created an assistant athletic position, a job divided among three varsity coaches. Steve Young, the athletic director for the Chappaqua schools, says field availability is a restraint for intramurals and many students want to make the aking varsity. Mr. Capalbo concurred and added that a big part of his job has become the act of putting his arm around a child who was just cut or is facing a crowded tryout in one sport and trying to herd that child toward cross-country or another sport with a good number of slots. As schools add sports, they look to ones that can support large rosters. Brewster has 23 sports and within those, a number of levels, from varsity to Jayvee, to freshman, down to pure eighth and seventh grade teams on the modified level, sometimes with A and B divisions past that. But the more crowded the schools get, the more competitive the environment becomes. ''You can have a freshman team and an A and B team for the jayvee,'' said Mr. Capalbo, ''but when it comes down to it, you still only have those five kids starting on the basketball team.''
