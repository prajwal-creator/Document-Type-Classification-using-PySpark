Credit Ethan Miller/Getty Images     The major theme of the United States basketball team heading to Turkey for the world championships this month is the unknown. With a so-called B-team roster void of stars like Kobe Bryant , Dwyane Wade and LeBron James , the United States is a tepid favorite. And with three key big men  —  Amar’e Stoudemire and the Lopez twins, Brook and Robin  —  unable to play, the team’s lack of size now matches its dearth of experience. That leaves Kevin Durant as perhaps the only certainty for the United States. The feeling in the Unites States camp is that if the Americans are to win their first world championship since 1994, Durant will need to be their leading scorer. “Without a doubt,” the veteran guard Chauncey Billups said. “He’d better be.” Durant, 21, became the youngest N.B.A. scoring champion last season, and the world championship offers him a platform to move into the elite constellation of N.B.A. stars. His supple jump shot and  athleticism will be on display Sunday at Madison Square Garden, where the United States will play  France before heading to Europe.

At the USA Basketball training camp in Las Vegas last month, he deflected questions about breaking through on a world stage, insisting he was hoping to make the team. That was after USA Basketball Coach Mike Krzyzewski said Durant was the only lock to make the team. Durant dodged questions about becoming a team leader by deferring to Billups and Lamar Odom , who are the team’s most experienced players. “There’s a lot of guys on this floor who know more than me,” Durant said. “They can help me a lot more than I can help the other guys.” Durant is so grounded that Oklahoma City Coach Scott Brooks said Durant traveled to the N.B.A. Summer League in Orlando, Fla., just to bond with his future teammates. While other elite N.B.A. stars were making movies and taking vacations, Durant worked out every morning at 6:45 a.m. and cheered on the Thunder rookies and some future Development League players. “That’s not abnormal behavior,” Brooks said. “That’s normal. If he didn’t do that, we’d think he was changing. But he works like that every day.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Brooks said Durant’s demeanor was so down to earth that he understood why people may have a difficult time believing it. He said Durant treated the equipment manager and the trainer in Oklahoma City with the same kindness and consideration that he treated the coaching staff and front office. This attitude comes as no surprise to USA Basketball officials, who said Durant was the only American player to attend each of the team’s training sessions for the past five years. “I don’t like talking about him,” Brooks said. “People look at me like I’m full of it. But it’s all true.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

His parents did a good job of raising him and the values of treating people with respect, the values of working hard and earning what you get and not asking for a handout.” Durant’s reticence  comes after a summer in which James turned off fans across the country with his free-agency circus,  capped by an ESPN special announcing his destination. Durant quietly signed a contract extension with the Thunder during that time. Durant said he avoided feeding the news media beast for fear that it would inevitably swallow him. “I was always told that people like the media are going to build you up to break you down,” he said. “We’ve seen that with LeBron; people are trying to break him down right now. I’m not even worried about the media hype or none of that.” Durant has seemingly always been that way. In college at Texas, he declined to pose for a Dime magazine cover unless the other four other Longhorns starters appeared with him. He returns to the university often, including for a Thunder exhibition game last year when he was spotted with his teammates James Harden and Russell Westbrook at a campus bus stop. Durant wanted to give them a tour of the campus via Forty Acres, the on-campus bus system. He turned down a ride from a stunned university official who spotted him waiting for the bus: he preferred to give a more authentic tour.

Since his early days at Texas, Durant showed the same  loyalty, humility and hard work that define him today. “He wants to be the best,” said the Texas assistant  Russell Springmann, who recruited Durant. “He doesn’t want to be good or great. He wants to be the best player, and that’s part of why he’s as driven as he is.” Durant, like most of his USA Basketball teammates, lacks international  experience. It remains to be seen how he handles the more physical style of play, and the team’s interior deficiencies mean he will  need to sharpen his elbows for post defense and rebounding. But there are aspects of the international game that are likely to  suit him. The shorter 3-point line will allow him to exploit the  zone defenses the Americans will inevitably see. The wider trapezoid lane will give him  more freedom to slash to the basket. And with Team USA’s coaching staff stressing the importance of players who can handle multiple positions, it is  possible that Durant could play the most minutes of anyone on the team. “He’s 7 feet tall and maybe one of the best shooters in the world,” Knicks Coach Mike D’Antoni said of Durant, listed at 6 feet 9 inches. “I don’t think they’ve invented a game of basketball yet that he wouldn’t be perfect for.” One of the few certainties of this United States team is that it will require top-level performances from Durant to win the  gold medal. In Istanbul, Durant will have the opportunity to show if he is the perfect player for this patchwork  American team.
